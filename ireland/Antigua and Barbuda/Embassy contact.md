## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Antigua and Barbuda, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, please contact the Irish Embassy in [**Ottawa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/canada/ottawa/)**.**

Monday to Friday 10am to 12pm and 2pm to 4pm.  
If urgent assistance is required outside of working hours Monday to Friday, please contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on +353 1 408 2000.
