## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

While the threat from terrorism is minimal, it is important not to rule out the risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low but visitors should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Lock doors and windows at night.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime, report it to the local police immediately.

### **Driving**

A temporary local driver's license is required to drive a vehicle, which can be obtained from the traffic department, any police station or car rental companies. Traffic in Antigua and Barbuda moves on the left. Major roads are in average to poor condition, and drivers may encounter wandering animals and slow-moving heavy equipment.

If taking a taxi, agree the fare with the local taxi driver before departing.

If planning to drive be careful and take these simple precautions:

* Bring your full Irish and international driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* Vehicles may stop without warning so always maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, do not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

### **Swimming**

Take great care at all times when swimming as currents can be strong and not all beaches have lifeguards.

### **Extreme Weather in the Caribbean Region**

The Atlantic hurricane season generally runs from June to November each year and can also affect the eastern and southern USA with heavy rain, flooding and extremely high winds. Visitors should monitor local and international weather updates from the [**Antigua & Barbuda Met Office**](http://www.antiguamet.com/) and the [**US National Hurricane Centre**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/index.shtml?atlc).

Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections.
