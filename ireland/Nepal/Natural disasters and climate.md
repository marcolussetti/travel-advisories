## Natural disasters and climate

### Monsoon Season

Travel in the rural areas during the Monsoon season (June - September) can be dangerous and you should be careful. Monsoon rains cause flooding and landslides that can cut off some towns and villages for days at a time. You should check access routes before setting off on a journey.

### **Avalanche/Landslide**

Earth tremors are common in this region and can cause landslides and avalanches in hilly and mountainous areas. In 2012, an avalanche/landslide caused flash flooding on the Seti River in the Kaski district north of Pokhara resulting in fatalities. Be alert to the risk of landslides and flash floods in mountainous areas and alongside river banks.

### **Earthquakes**

Nepal is considered to be at high risk of a major earthquake. In the event of a large scale earthquake the assistance that can be given to Irish citizens would be extremely limited. If major roads and the international airport are damaged, it may not be possible for people to be evacuated for several days.

**If you are travelling to Nepal, we advise that you check with your insurance provider the details which govern your policy cover in the event of an earthquake in the country.**
