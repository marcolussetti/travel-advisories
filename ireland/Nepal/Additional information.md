## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Nepal and can apply for a tourist visa from the [**Embassy of Nepal in London**](https://uk.nepalembassy.gov.np/), or avail of the tourist visa-on-arrival service.

Please consult the Nepal [**Department of Immigration website**](https://www.immigration.gov.np/) for details of the requirements to avail of the visa-on-arrival service, which may change at short notice.

If you have any immigration queries, you should contact the Embassy of Nepal or the Department of Immigration directly.

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Nepal.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Nepal.

Medical treatment is expensive at western travellers' clinics in Nepal, while healthcare is poor in most places outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara.

### **Food and Water**

Travellers to Nepal should be aware that food and water hygiene standards are not comparable to Ireland. Water-borne and food-borne diseases can cause serious illness and simple precautions include avoiding ice cubes; not drinking tap water; avoiding uncooked and undercooked food, especially from street vendors; and drinking boiled water or bottled water with intact sealed caps.
