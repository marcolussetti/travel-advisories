## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Nepal.

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical treatment is expensive at western travellers' clinics in Nepal, while healthcare is poor in most places outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara.

### **Food and Water**

Travellers to Nepal should be aware that food and water hygiene standards are not comparable to Ireland. Water-borne and food-borne diseases can cause serious illness and simple precautions include avoiding ice cubes; not drinking tap water; avoiding uncooked and undercooked food, especially from street vendors; and drinking boiled water or bottled water with intact sealed caps.
