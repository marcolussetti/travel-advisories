## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local culture**

You should respect local customs and dress conservatively. Women should avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless tops in public places where this might be seen as inappropriate. Shoes should be removed before entering certain holy places.Â Non-Hindus are not permitted in certain temples.

### **Illegal drugs**

Penalties for drugs related offences are severe. Possession of small amounts of marijuana can lead to a prison sentence in excess of five years, usually after a lengthy and expensive legal process.

### **Surrogacy**

The Supreme Court of Nepal has issued an interim order to immediately halt commercial surrogacy services in Nepal. We strongly recommend that commissioning parents not consider surrogacy in Nepal.
