## Travel to Nepal overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

On 8 September, violent clashes and protests, leading to massive damage of property and a loss of life, broke out in Kathmandu and across Nepal. This followed restrictions placed by the Government on social media and messaging platforms. These restrictions have now been lifted, but there may still be some disruptions to communication services and isolated incidents of violence. Curfews have now been lifted, but could be reintroduced.

Kathmandu airport reopened on September 10th. Passengers should contact their airline or tour operator for up to date information.

Whereas calm has been restored to much of the country following the appointment of an interim prime minister, the situation remains volatile with the potential for further protests. Irish citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations, exercise caution in public places, stay alert, monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Nepal.

A valid passport is required for travel to Nepal. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months.  Passport cards cannot be used.

There are no COVID-19 travel restrictions in place for travel to Nepal, however this may change at short notice. For the latest information on entry requirements and visas, you should consult [**the Department of Immigration’s website.**](https://www.immigration.gov.np/)

The monsoon season normally runs from June to September and often causes flooding and landslides. All means of travel can be hazardous, particularly in rural areas, and we recommend Irish citizens exercise caution when travelling, monitor local news sources, and plan alternative routes before travelling.

Earth tremors are common across Nepal and the country is considered to be at high risk of a major earthquake. Nepal experienced two very strong earthquakes in April and May 2015 resulting in extensive damage to various parts of the country. The earthquakes caused infrastructural damage, caused landslides and left many roads in a fragile state.

Some towns, including Kathmandu, are often subject to severe levels of air pollution during the winter months, which can have short-term and long-term health implications for residents and visitors. We advise citizens to monitor air pollution levels, follow the advice of local authorities and to reduce their exposure to air pollution where possible by staying indoors and avoiding strenuous outdoor activity. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are concerned about the impact of pollution on your health, we advise you to seek medical advice before travelling to these locations.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in India on social media (X [**@IrlEmbIndia**](https://x.com/irlembindia) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinIndia/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**
