## Travel to Cuba overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Power Outage**

Cuba has recently experienced several nationwide electrical grid shutdowns (most recently in March). A schedule of outages remains in place to restrict electricity usage. Basic services in eastern and other parts of Cuba are still affected in the wake of the 2024 hurricane season, as well as the earthquake on 10 November.

While in Cuba, you should take the necessary precautions, including conserving water and food and keeping your mobile phone charged. Please monitor local media for updates, including on power cut schedules.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Cuba but will need to acquire a tourist card. In addition to advice from airline or travel operators who may be able to provide this, more information on the card is available [**here**](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/ireland/consular-services#visa_turismo). Dual citizens (Irish-Cuban), should contact the Cuban Embassy for advice on entry requirements before undertaking travel.

A valid passport is required for travel to Cuba, and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used. Please note that travelling to Cuba will impact on travel and entry to the United States – please see ‘US Travel’ section below.

The arrival form on the [D’Viajeros traveller information portal](https://dviajeros.mitrans.gob.cu/inicio) must be completed at least 72 hours prior to arrival. A QR code will be issued to present to authorities on arrival.

Irish citizens in Cuba most frequently need consular assistance due to difficulties using debit/credit/cash point cards and exchanging money in Cuba. Please see our “additional information” section for further details. The Cuban Peso (CUP or moneda nacional) is the only legal tender in Cuba. Visitors should bring cash (eg: Euros) to Cuba, and use reputable bureaus de change (Cadecas), their hotel or a bank to exchange this money. Private hotels, bars and restaurants may accept cash payments in foreign currency. See our Additional Information Section for further information.

If your passport is lost or stolen, getting a replacement can be complex due to the limited availability of courier services to the island so keep travel documents secure at all times. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if a copy of the lost or stolen one is provided, so keep photocopies of your passport.

Before travelling to Cuba, you must have comprehensive travel insurance that will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation for the full duration of your stay. A copy of your insurance must be presented on arrival. Visitors to the island are encouraged to bring a sufficient supply of medication or other essential items as they are not always available. Visitors should also be aware that energy blackouts can occur at short notice on a rolling basis, and fuel supplies can be affected (this may also have an affect on the availability of transportation).

### **US Travel**

On 12 January 2021, the United States designated Cuba a State Sponsor of Terrorism (more information available on the US State Department’s website [**here**](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/)). Travellers who have visited a country designated as State Sponsor of Terrorism are no longer eligible to participate in the Visa Wavier Program (ESTA), and must apply for a visa to enter the United States. If you have any doubts about your eligibility for an ESTA, we advise Irish citizens to apply in good time for a US visa through the US Embassy in Dublin or another US embassy or consulate.

From 7 July 2023, existing ESTAs will be revoked for travellers who have visited Cuba on or after 12 January 2021.

Anyone traveling to Cuba from the United States, regardless of citizenship and nationality (including Irish citizens), must comply with US regulations on travel to Cuba. US law prohibits travel to Cuba for tourism reasons. Travelling to Cuba from the USA is allowable under certain categories. For more information see the [**US Department of the Treasury website**](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/cuba_faqs_20170725.pdf) and the [**US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba**](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/cuba.html). For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations [**31 C.F.R. 515.560**](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b5ee59d94ee45bba6a049240298f1cff&mc=true&node=se31.3.515_1560&rgn=div8) and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [**frequently asked questions**](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/cuba.aspx).

### **Hurricanes**

The hurricane season generally runs from June to November each year and can also affect the eastern and southern USA with heavy rain, flooding and extremely high winds.

Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

Visitors to Cuba are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Mexico on social media (X@[**IrishEmbMexico**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbMexico/status/1585702058497232896/photo/3) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

If emergency medical assistance is required during your trip, the emergency number (for ambulance) is 104. Your hotel or casa particular host can direct you to any clinics that cater to foreign tourists. It is important to contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment.
