## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Cuba, and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Cuba but will need to acquire a tourist card. Further information on tourist card can be found [**here**](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/ireland/consular-services#visa_turismo).

The arrival form on the [**Dâ€™Viajeros traveller information portal**](https://dviajeros.mitrans.gob.cu/inicio) must be completed at least 72 hours prior to arrival. A QR code will be issued to present to authorities on arrival.
