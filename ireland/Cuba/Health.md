## Health

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Cuba.

### **Medical facilities**

Generally, Cuba’s medical services are acceptable, although basic medicine and equipment are not always available. Bring any prescription drugs you take regularly. A copy of the prescription and a letter from a doctor explaining your condition can be helpful at customs.

The medical facilities in Havana are better than those available elsewhere in the country, but it is sometimes necessary to medically evacuate those who require urgent specialist care. This can be very expensive so ensure that your medical insurance covers this. If medical treatment is needed you will be expected to pay in hard currency; a basic hospital stay can cost as much as €250 per day plus medical expenses.

### **Malaria**

Malaria and dengue fever are endemic in low-lying rural areas of Cuba and outbreaks can occur throughout the year. If planning to visit these areas, before travelling there you should consult a doctor about suitable anti-malarial medication and on arrival take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes. Mosquito repellent and clothing covering as much skin as possible provides some protection, and swampy water should be avoided.

### **Zika Virus**

There have been outbreaks of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/).
