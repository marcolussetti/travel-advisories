## Safety and security

Most visits to Cuba are trouble-free but please take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone, and check no one has followed you.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Petty theft**

Theft from luggage during baggage handling at airports can occur both on arrival and departure. Always remove all valuables, lock suitcases and consider having them shrink-wrapped before check-in.

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs, particularly on public transport, intercity buses and at major tourist areas including in Old Havana, El Centro, Vedado and the Malecon, as well as on the beaches of Playa del Este and Varedero. Take all necessary precautions if you are in Centro Havana at night and take a taxi to your accommodation rather than walk, even if your accommodation is only a few blocks away.

Thefts from hotel and guesthouse accommodation occur. We advised you to ensure that valuables are held securely and to exercise due caution at all times.

### **Serious crime**

Car-related crime and muggings can occur from time to time in areas including Havana, Santiago and other areas less frequented by tourists. There have been attacks on foreigners using hire cars after staged punctures and by bogus hitch-hikers. Do not pick people up. If you get a puncture in a lonely spot, drive on several kilometres, preferably to a town, before stopping.

### **Lost or stolen passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen, getting a replacement can take up to two weeks so keep your travel documents secure at all times. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if a copy of the lost or stolen one is provided, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Cuba, report it to the local police immediately. If assistance is required please contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Mexico City**](/en/mexico/mexicocity/).

### **Driving**

Many vehicles, including public transport, suffer from lack of maintenance and roads are poorly lit and sign-posted. If driving:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and an international driving permit and ensure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Beware of cyclists, potholes and cars that stop without warning to pick up hitchhikers

### **Traffic accidents**

If involved in an accident, you may be detained, regardless of who is at fault. If you have a traffic accident where someone is killed or injured, the police investigation may take several months during which time the driver will normally not be allowed to leave Cuba. In some cases the driver may be imprisoned during this delay.

### **Public transport**

* Only use established tour operators and regulated taxis
* Avoid using mopeds or three wheel Coco-Taxis for travel around Cuba

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Hurricanes**

The hurricane season in Cuba extends from June to the end of November.  Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

In some areas, adequate shelter from a severe hurricane may not be available to all who may choose to stay. Familiarise yourself with hotel or cruise ship evacuation plans and identify local shelters. Carry travel documents at all times (ie passport, picture IDs) or secure them in a safe, waterproof location. Also contact friends and family in Ireland with updates to let them know you are safe.
