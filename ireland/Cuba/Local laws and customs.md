## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

While in Cuba, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of local authorities. During periods of tension, access to the internet may be blocked in some areas.

### **Personal identification**

Personal identification must be carried at all times in Cuba as you may be detained if unable to produce it to the authorities on request. We advise you to carry a photocopy of the relevant page of your passport and keep the original in a safe place.

### **Illegal drugs**

Cuba is increasingly used as a transit country for drugs destined for Europe. Cuban law allows for the death penalty and courts are handing out very severe penalties (in excess of twenty years) for all drug related offences. Avoid any contact with prohibited drugs. Always pack your entire luggage yourself and never carry any items that do not belong to you in or out of the country.
