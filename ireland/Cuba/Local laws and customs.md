## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

While in Cuba, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings, keep yourself informed of developments and follow the advice of local authorities. During periods of tension, access to the internet may be blocked in some areas.

### **Personal Identification**

Personal identification must be carried at all times in Cuba as you may be detained if unable to produce it to the authorities on request. We advise you to carry a photocopy of the relevant page of your passport and keep the original in a safe place.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Cuba is increasingly used as a transit country for drugs destined for Europe. Cuban law allows for the death penalty and courts are handing out very severe penalties (in excess of twenty years) for all drug related offences. Avoid any contact with prohibited drugs. Always pack your entire luggage yourself and never carry any items that do not belong to you in or out of the country.

### **Money**

Irish citizens in Cuba most frequently need consular assistance due to difficulties using debit/credit/cash point cards and exchanging money so please be aware of the following:

* Check with your bank before you travel to confirm that your debit, credit and ATM cards will work in Cuba. If no confirmation is received from the bank, then bring euro in cash.
* Only change money in Cadeca exchange houses, large hotels or banks. Always exercise caution, check transactions carefully and ask for small denomination bills.
* Credit cards and travellers' cheques drawn on American banks are not accepted in Cuba. Confirm with your bank before departure that credit cards will be accepted in Cuba
* There are virtually no ATMs available for drawing cash against debit cards in Cuba
* While Western Union operates in Cuba, only Cuban nationals can access its services â€“ foreign tourists cannot. There is no other way of transferring funds to Cuba
* Northern Irish and Scottish sterling bank notes/coins cannot be exchanged in Cuba
