## Travel to Liberia overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Liberia. For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

A valid passport is required for travel to Liberia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Liberia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@irlembliberia**](https://twitter.com/irlembliberia) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Street Protests**

Large protests took place in 2020, and smaller-scale protests are commonplace, regularly leading to local disruption. We recommend that visitors avoid protest areas and demonstrations if possible, stay informed of what is happening, and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Petty Crime**

Crime levels are moderate to high in Liberia. Most crimes are opportunistic, and the risk of theft and burglaries increases around Christmas period. We advise visitors to be vigilant at all times, particularly after dark when crime levels are higher, and always take sensible precautions (more detail in the safety and security section).

### **Medical Services**

The availability and quality of medical services in Liberia is poor. Citizens should be aware that they may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly outside the capital city, Monrovia. If treatment is needed, you may be asked to pay up front. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment during your stay. Be sure to bring enough medication for the duration of your visit.

If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Liberia, or in the few weeks following your departure from Liberia, telephone your GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and travel history, since it may result from an infection like malaria that requires immediate investigation and treatment.

If planning to drive in Liberia, be extremely careful as traffic accidents are common. Emergency medical services in Liberia are limited, and poorly equipped to deal with road traffic accidents, particularly those involving complex trauma. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised when using the road, either as a driver or as a passenger.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative, employer or hotel management.
