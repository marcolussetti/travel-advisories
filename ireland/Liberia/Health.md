## Health

### **Medical Services**

The availability and quality of medical services in Liberia is poor. Citizens should be aware that you may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas. If you need treatment, you may be asked to pay up front.

### **Pre-existing Medical Condition**

If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that you may not be able to get appropriate drugs or treatment during your stay.

### **Medication**

If you choose to travel, bring enough medication with you for the duration of your visit and copies of your prescription.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, we strongly recommend that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you in Liberia for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Water**

Mains water is limited, and tap water should be boiled before drinking. Bottled water is readily available.

### **Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Outbreak**

In February 2021, there was an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea close to the Liberian border, and Liberian authorities have increased surveillance and preventative measures.

While the risk of contracting Ebola is extremely low, as it is expected that response systems in Liberia will be capable of containing, and dealing with, potential future flare-ups, visitors should nonetheless exercise due caution, and take necessary precautions to prevent infection. Individuals should avoid being directly exposed to any bodily fluids from a dead or living Ebola-infected person, including through unprotected sexual contact with patients that have recovered from Ebola. If you do become exposed, you should seek rapid medical attention. You should contact the medical care facility by phone before your visit, in order to enable medical personnel to use appropriate protection at the time of admission.

Further information on Ebola is available from the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre website.**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/ViralHaemorrhagicFever/Ebola/)

If you develop a fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Liberia, or in the few weeks following your departure from Liberia, you should telephone your GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history, since it may result from an infection like malaria that requires immediate investigation and treatment.

### **Marburg Virus Disease**

A Marburg Virus Disease outbreak was officially declared by the Guinean government on 6 August 2021. Liberia is now tightening surveillance and community engagement for alerts, reporting, and preventive measures for Marburg virus disease (MVD) as well as Ebola virus disease (EVD) along the border with Guinea. This is the first time that MVD has been identified in West Africa. Risk of transmission is high at national and regional level. So far no MVD alert has been reported in Liberia.

### **Yellow Fever**

The yellow fever vaccination is an entry requirement for Liberia and a yellow fever vaccination certificate will be requested by border control on arrival in the country.

### **Malaria**

Malaria, including cerebral malaria which can be fatal within 72 hours, is endemic in Liberia and we strongly recommend using a malaria prophylaxis, together with other precautions such as using bed nets and insect repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. You should also bring enough malaria treatment for the duration of your visit.

### **Water-borne Diseases**

Cholera and other water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, giardia, dysentery and typhoid are also very common, so practise good hygiene, drink and brush your teeth with bottled water only, and avoid eating uncooked vegetables, salads, seafood and meats.

### **Lassa Fever**

Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with urine or feces of infected Mastomys rats; or through contact with the bodily fluids of a person with Lassa fever. Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and the country is currently facing an outbreak. We advise Irish citizens to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms of Lassa fever. More information is available on the [**WHO website**](https://www.who.int/health-topics/lassa-fever/#tab=tab_1).

### **General Diseases**

Other diseases including but not limited to, rabies, HIV, hepatitis A and B, meningitis and polio and are also present in some parts of Liberia and can pose a risk.
