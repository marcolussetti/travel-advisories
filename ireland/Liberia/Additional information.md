## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a valid visa to enter Liberia. Visa applications from Ireland should be submitted to the [**Embassy of the Republic of Liberia in London**](https://www.embassyofliberia.co.uk/consular-services/). Those travelling to Liberia are also required to show evidence of having received a yellow fever vaccination.

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Liberia.

### **Climate**

The climate in Liberia is consistently hot and humid year round, with temperatures fluctuating between 25 and 35 degrees Celsius. The dry season extends from November to April and the rainy season lasts from May to October. The rainy season brings extremely heavy rainfalls and thunderstorms. Travellers should be careful when travelling during the rainy season as flash floods can occur in exceptional circumstances.

### **Banking and Money**

The official currency of Liberia is the Liberia Dollar. However, US dollars are widely accepted. Liberia is a cash-based economy and you should bring enough cash to cover your expenses while here. Credit cards and travellersâ€™ cheques are very rarely accepted and you should not rely on them.

Although there are a number of ATMs in Monrovia, many do not accept foreign bank or credit cards and the security of the transactions can not be guaranteed. The exchange rate given by ATMs is also highly unfavourable.

There are restrictions on how much cash you can bring into the country, and you should verify the latest requirements with your nearest Embassy of the Republic of Liberia before travelling. Always be careful when carrying cash. Facilities to exchange Euro for dollars in Liberia are very limited, and do not assume that you will be able to exchange Euro in Liberia.

### **Language**

English is the official language of Liberia.

### **Water and Power**

Mains water is limited, and tap water should be boiled before drinking. Bottled water is readily available.

Power is improving but remains unreliable, particularly during the dry season. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.
