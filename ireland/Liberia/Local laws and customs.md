## Local laws and customs

While in Liberia, you are subject to local laws and customs. Respect local traditions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs. Any Irish citizen who commits a criminal offence can expect to be prosecuted and jailed or expelled from the country. Prison conditions are extremely difficult.

### **Personal ID**

Carry photographic ID at all times, as you may be asked to produce it at any time by immigration officials or the police. We recommend carrying a photocopy of your passport, along with another form of photographic ID. Keep your passport in a safe place.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual activity is illegal. Caution and discretion are advised at all times. Transgender persons may face additional discrimination or adverse treatment.

### **Religion**

Approximately 85% of the population of Liberia practices Christianity, with 12% practicing Islam. While the Constitution protects freedom of religion, some religious tensions exist.

Always be sensitive to local customs when abroad. It is often best to behave conservatively, at least until you know your way around. Avoid public displays of affection and dress modestly, particularly in places of worship.

### **Illegal Activities**

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of drugs and for diamond smuggling are severe. Do not become involved in these activities in any way. The importation of firearms into Liberia is prohibited under UN sanctions.

### **Banking and Money**

The official currency of Liberia is the Liberia Dollar. However, US dollars are widely accepted. Liberia is a cash-based economy and you should bring enough cash to cover your expenses while here. Credit cards and travellersâ€™ cheques are very rarely accepted and you should not rely on them.

Although there are a number of ATMs in Monrovia, many do not accept foreign bank or credit cards and the security of the transactions can not be guaranteed. The exchange rate given by ATMs is also highly unfavourable.

There are restrictions on how much cash you can bring into the country, and you should verify the latest requirements with your nearest Embassy of the Republic of Liberia before travelling. Always be careful when carrying cash. Facilities to exchange Euro for dollars in Liberia are very limited, and do not assume that you will be able to exchange Euro in Liberia.

### **Language**

English is the official language of Liberia.

### **Power**

Power is improving but remains unreliable, particularly during the dry season. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.
