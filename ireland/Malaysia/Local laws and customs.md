## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local culture**

Malaysia is a multicultural but mainly Islamic country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they don't offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.

Also dress moderately, particularly in conservative and rural places and when visiting places of worship.

Importing unlicensed firearms and ammunition into Malaysia is prohibited and can carry the death penalty.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual acts are illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

There are severe penalties for all drug offences; this includes amphetamine-type stimulants. Trafficking incurs a mandatory death penalty. Possession incurs a custodial sentence and possible whipping.

The Malaysian authorities may require you to take a urine test on arrival if you are suspected of having used illegal drugs before your visit.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in Malaysia are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and those over the legal limit could receive a jail sentence and/or a heavy fine. Breath testing is common in Malaysia
* Take care as motorcyclists do not always stop at pedestrian crossings or at traffic lights. If driving, make sure that motorcyclists are not overtaking on the inside when you are making a left turn.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
