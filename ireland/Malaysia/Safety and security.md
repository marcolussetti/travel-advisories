## Safety and security

### **Political Unrest, risk of Kidnapping**

### **Eastern Sabah**

There is a threat of kidnapping on the eastern coast of Sabah, particularly on the islands close to the Sulu Archipeligo of the Philippines.

We advise against non-essential travel to all islands off the coast of eastern Sabah from Kudat to Tawau (on the Indonesian border), including (but not limited to) Lankayan, Selingan Turtle Island, Mabul, Pom Pom, Kapalai, Litigan, Sipadan and Mataking.

Exercise caution in areas on the eastern coast of Sabah including in the town of Sandakan and along the coast to Tawau on the Indonesian border, as well as the areas east of Lahad Datu and around Semporna. Keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of your tour operator and the local authorities.

Irish citizens visiting eastern Sabah should exercise extreme caution. In some areas (see above) we advise against all but essential travel. Ensure that you take appropriate personal security measures, and follow the advice of authorities ([**Eastern Sabah Security Command**](https://www.facebook.com/esscomsabah/)) and tour operators. Despite the increased police and army presence, the size and remoteness of the region means that future security incidents cannot be ruled out.

### **Demonstrations**

We advise visitors to avoid all demonstrations and follow developments in local media. It is illegal for foreigners to participate in demonstrations in Malaysia.

### **Terrorism**

Terrorist attacks have occurred and cannot be ruled out. The last terror-related attack took place at a Malaysian police station in Ulu Tiram, Johor in 2024..

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Malaysia but bag snatching by thieves on motorbikes can occur in the central tourist areas of Kuala Lumpur. Be vigilant and take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime.

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* You must carry photo identification with you at all times. Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary. Leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home and, if possible, have an electronic copy in cloud storage where you can retrieve it if necessary. We advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport during your stay and to carry a photocopy at all times.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and avoid using ATMs after dark, especially if alone. There are often ATMs at well-lit shopping malls. Check no one has followed you after you have taken out money.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold onto them in public places such as train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* There have been a number of reports of scams involving gambling and the spiking of drinks, which has led to robbery and assault.
* Credit card fraud and ATM scams are commonplace in the region, so be vigilant when making payments and also when using ATM machines to withdraw cash.
* As in other countries, avoid opening your hotel room door to strangers – especially if you are a woman travelling alone.
