## Safety and security

### **Political Unrest, risk of Kidnapping**

### **Eastern Sabah**

There is a threat of kidnapping on the eastern coast of Sabah, particularly on the islands close to the Sulu Archipeligo of the Philippines.

We advise against all but essential travel to all islands off the coast of eastern Sabah from Kudat to Tawau, including (but not limited to) Lankayan, Mabul, Pom Pom, Kapalai, Litigan, Sipadan and Mataking.

Exercise great caution in areas on the eastern coast of Sabah including in the town of Sandakan and along the coast to Tawau, as well as the areas east of Lahad Datu and around Semporna. Keep up to date with developments and follow the advice of your tour operator and the local authorities.

Irish citizens visiting eastern Sabah should exercise extreme caution. In some areas (see above) we advise against all but essential travel. Ensure that you take appropriate personal security measures, and follow the advice of authorities and tour operators. Despite the increased police and army presence, the size and remoteness of the region means that future security incidents cannot be ruled out.

### **Demonstrations**

Tensions between the Malaysian Government and opposition have occasionally led to demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur and elsewhere. We advise visitors to avoid all demonstrations and follow developments in local media.

### **Terrorism**

Terrorists may be planning attacks in and around Kuala Lumpur. Attacks could be indiscriminate and may target Western interests or locations frequented by Westerners. Be vigilant at this time.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Malaysia but bag snatching by thieves on motorbike is becoming a regular occurrence in the central tourist areas of Kuala Lumpur. Be vigilant and take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime.

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible
* There have been a number of reports of scams involving gambling and the spiking of drinks, which has led to robbery and assault.
* Credit card fraud and ATM scams are commonplace in the region, so be vigilant when making payments and also when using ATM machines to withdraw cash.
* As in other countries, avoid opening your hotel room door to strangers â€“ especially if you are a woman travelling alone.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Malaysia, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at the Irish Embassy if help is needed.
