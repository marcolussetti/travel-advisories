## Natural disasters and climate

### **Flooding**

The Northeast Monsoon from November to March brings heavy rainfall, particularly to the east coast states of peninsular Malaysia and western Sarawak. This occasionally leads to heavy and dangerous flooding.

### **Pollution**

Air quality in Malaysia is compromised seasonally on account of smoke haze. Air pollution is generally worse during the months of June to October. This improves with the onset of the monsoon season. Monitor the information on air quality on the [**Malaysian Department of the Environment**](http://www.doe.gov.my/) website and follow health advisories.

### **Volcanoes and Earthquakes**

Seismic and volcanic activity in Malaysia cannot be ruled out. The last major seismic activity was a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in Sabah early on 5 June 2015. This affected Mount Kinabalu. Please see the [**Sabah tourism website**](http://www.sabahtourism.com/) for more information and continue to monitor local authorities and media across all of Malaysia for updates.
