## Natural disasters and climate

### **Flooding**

The Northeast Monsoon from November to March brings heavy rainfall, particularly to the east coast states of peninsular Malaysia and western Sarawak. This occasionally leads to heavy and dangerous flooding.

### **Pollution**

Air quality in Malaysia is compromised seasonally on account of smoke haze. This improves with the onset of the monsoon season. At present, air pollution is worse than usual for this time of year in a number of states due to land and forest fires and the persistent hot, dry weather. Monitor the information on air quality on the Malaysian Department of the Environment website and follow health advisories.

### **Volcanoes**

There was a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in Sabah early on 5 June 2015. This affected Mount Kinabalu. Please see the [**Sabah tourism website**](http://www.sabahtourism.com/) for more information and continue to monitor local media for updates.
