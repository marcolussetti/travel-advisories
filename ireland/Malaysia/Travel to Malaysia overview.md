### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens are not required to apply for a visa prior to entering Malaysia for short-term visits of less than 90 days for tourism purposes. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.

All travellers are required to submit their [**Malaysia Digital Arrival Card**](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) (MDAC) within 3 days before arriving in Malaysia.

Check with the Malaysian Embassy in your country of residence in advance of travel as to what is required. Contact details for the Malaysian Embassy in Dublin may be found [**here**](https://www.kln.gov.my/web/irl_dublin).

A valid passport is required for travel to Malaysia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used. You may be asked for further supporting documents on the purpose of your visit and intended duration of your stay. Permission to enter or to remain in Malaysia is at the sole decision and discretion of the Malaysian Immigration authorities.

Visitors intending to transit through Kuala Lumpur International Airport, should carefully confirm any transit arrangements for connecting flights with their airline in advance of travel. Transit between terminals KLIA1 and KLIA2 requires exiting through Malaysian immigration and entering again.

Visitors are required to pass through Malaysian Immigration upon leaving the country. Do not overstay your entry visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported or blacklisted.

If travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. Visitors must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.

For more information or further queries citizens should contact Malaysian Immigration directly, on Hotline numbers: 03 8888 2010 or +03 8000 8000, via the [**website**](https://www.imi.gov.my/) or email: **pls\_g@imi.gov.my**.

Visitors to Malaysia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media, such as [**Bernama**](https://www.bernama.com/)**,** [**NST**](https://www.nst.com.my/) and [**The Star**](https://www.thestar.com.my/).

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media - [**X**](https://x.com/IrlEmbMalaysia), [**Facebook**](https://facebook.com/IrlEmbMalaysia) and [**Instagram**](http://www.instagram.com/IrlEmbMalaysia)- to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.
