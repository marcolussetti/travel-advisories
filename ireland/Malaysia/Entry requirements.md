## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

In general, Irish tourists visiting Malaysia for less than 3 months do not require a visa. Malaysian immigration requires international visitors (with the exception of children under 12) to provide fingerprints before entering Malaysia. For full entry requirements for Malaysia, please contact the nearest Malaysian Embassy or Consulate.

We advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport during your stay and to carry a photocopy at all times.

You must also pass through Malaysian Immigration upon exiting the country. We advise you to ensure immigration officials stamp your passport with the correct date upon entering and exiting Malaysia.â€¯Failing to show proof of entry into Malaysia can result in fines and/or detention. If you overstay your Malaysian visa for even a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported and/or blacklisted by the Malaysian Immigration Authorities. Ensure that you abide by the terms and conditions of your entry pass for Malaysia at all times.

If you get a new Irish passport, you will need to go to the nearest Malaysian Immigration office to get your visa/pass put into the new passport. This also applies for emergency passports e.g. if you lose your Irish passport and if you are leaving the country, you will still need to go to an Immigration office to get a Special/Exit pass for the new passport/emergency travel document before you can depart the country.
