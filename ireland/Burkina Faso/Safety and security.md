## Safety and security

The political and security situation in Burkina Faso remains unstable and volatile following a military coup in September 2022. Citizens should be aware that political instability continues in Burkina Faso, that the situation is tense and liable to change at short notice. The Department advises citizens to exercise extreme caution if in the country, stay indoors, avoid unnecessary journeys, keep up to date with local developments, avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings, and observe any local curfews or restrictions. There is the strong potential for the security situation to deteriorate without warning.

There is an underlying threat from terrorism. There is a credible risk that terrorist groups based inside and outside the country may carry out attacks, such as shootings, bombings, and kidnappings. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and may target places where foreigners gather, such as diplomatic premises, conference centres, tourist sites, shopping centres, transport hubs, religious site, hotels and restaurants in the capital.

There are frequent attacks across Burkina Faso, particularly close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire and in the eastern region. Examples of such attacks include in 26 April 2021, an Irish citizen and two Spanish citizens were killed in an ambush while travelling between Fada-N’Gourma and Pama. Further attacks are possible.

There may be a heightened risk of attack during festivals, and religious and public holiday periods. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.

Citizens should exercise caution and avoid large political rallies and gatherings, areas of demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. In the event of unrest monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities.
