## Travel to Burkina Faso overview

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly** **advises against all travel to Burkina Faso.**

The political and security situation in Burkina Faso remains unstable and volatile following a military coup in September 2022. There remains potential for further unrest at short notice. Additionally, there is a threat of terrorist attacks and terrorist kidnappings.

Citizens in the country are advised to be vigilant, avoid unnecessary journeys, keep up to date with local developments, avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings, and observe any local curfews or restrictions. Citizens should also be prepared to leave the country, if possible, at short notice.

### **General Travel Advice**

Ouagadougou International Airport and Bobo-Dioulasso Airport are operating with limited international commercial flights. Check with your travel company for the latest information.

Visitors to Burkina Faso are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Nigeria on social media ( [**X**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbNigeria) and [**Facebook)**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandnigeria/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
