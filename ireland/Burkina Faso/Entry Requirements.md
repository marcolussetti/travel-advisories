## Entry Requirements

### **Visa/Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Burkina Faso and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
