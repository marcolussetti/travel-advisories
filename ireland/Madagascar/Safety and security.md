## Safety and security

### **Practical Advice**

* Get advice locally about areas of risk and security concerns
* Take common-sense precautions about safety and security
* Know who to contact in case of an emergency

### **Political Unrest**

Violent protests have taken place in Madagascar. While the situation has stabilised since 27 September, further protests are expected and the unrest has spread to other parts of Madagascar. A curfew is in place from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m in Antananarivo and other major cities. Please pay attention to your surroundings, stay away from crowds and large gatherings, monitor the local media, and follow instructions from the authorities.

Antananarivo International Airport is operational and accessible, but several flights were cancelled at the start of the unrest. Check with your airline or tour operator before travelling to an airport.

Madagascar has a history of political unrest, and the situation can be unpredictable. Due to the possibility of violence, you should avoid large gatherings and political demonstrations, and avoid the centre of Antananarivo.

Always keep yourself informed by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational or violent.

### **Crime**

Robberies, theft and street crime occur frequently in towns and cities, in nature reserves and on beaches. Carjacking and theft from cars have become more frequent. If you are travelling to Madagascar you should take these sensible precautions to protect yourself against crime:

* Do not carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* You should carry your passport with you, but keep it concealed and secure.  Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas like street markets and airports.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Madagascar, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact the Irish Embassy in Mozambique if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you are planning to drive in Madagascar, follow these basic guidelines:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and your international driving permit
* Make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
