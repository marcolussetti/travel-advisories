## Local laws and customs

Possession of ivory in any form, as well as other protected animal parts, is a crime in Kenya and can result in a large fine or imprisonment.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Individuals are required by law to carry ID on them at all times and police may request evidence of this. Kenyan identification documents or passports should be carried at all times. Keep a photocopy of the data and photo page of your passport in a safe place.

We advise caution if purchasing land or engaging in business ventures in Kenya as fraud is very common. Title deeds/certificates of ownership should be closely examined and verified with the authorities before any transaction takes place. Commercial disputes can take many years to resolve before the courts.

We advise caution if travelling to Kenya to meet an online acquaintance due to instances of fraud.
