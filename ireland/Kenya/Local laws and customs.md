## Local laws and customs

Possession of ivory in any form, as well as other protected animal parts, is a crime in Kenya and can result in a large fine or imprisonment.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Individuals are required by law to carry ID on them at all times and police may request evidence of this. Kenyan identification documents or passports should be carried at all times. Keep a photocopy of the data and photo page of your passport in a safe place.

### **Fraud**

We advise caution if purchasing land or engaging in business ventures in Kenya as fraud is very common. Title deeds/certificates of ownership should be closely examined and verified with the authorities before any transaction takes place. Commercial disputes can take many years to resolve before the courts.

We advise caution if travelling to Kenya to meet an online acquaintance due to instances of fraud.

### **LGBT Travellers**

Homosexuality is illegal in Kenya and public displays of affection could lead to arrest and imprisonment. More information for LGBT travellers is available at the following link [**dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/lgbt/**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go-/)

### **Plastic Bags**

Kenya has banned plastic bags for environmental reasons and you will be asked to leave any plastic bags on the plane before leaving the aircraft on arrival.

### **Smoking**

Kenya prohibits smoking in public places, except in designated smoking areas. If in any doubt do not smoke.

### **Dress**

Many areas of Kenya are predominately Muslim. Dress conservatively if travelling in these areas outside of resorts.

### **Photography**

Photography is prohibited around many government buildings and facilities including airports. This includes the CBD area of Nairobi.

### **Fines**

If issued with an on the spot fine ask that the correct process is followed and that you are issued with the correct documentation.

### **Money**

The currency in Kenya is Kenya Shilling and it is used for most transactions. Prices for hotels and safaris are usually quoted in US dollars but can also be paid in Kenya Shillings. US dollars are generally not accepted elsewhere.

ATM machines and currency exchange offices are widely available.

### **Volunteering**

International volunteering in the Global South is popular among Irish people. While in some countries it may be possible to volunteer in or visit orphanages, this can have serious consequences for children. Growing evidence demonstrates the links between institutions and trafficking, with volunteer visits helping to sustain an ‘orphanage industry’, increasing the risk of exposure to abuse and exploitation.

Comhlámh’s Code of Good Practice is a set of standards for Irish Volunteer Sending Agencies (VSAs). VSAs commit to child-safe volunteering, ensuring that no programmes or activities involve the sending of volunteers to orphanages, with one exception - the sending of skilled and vetted volunteers in support of de-institutionalisation.

If you intend to volunteer with an organisation in Kenya, we encourage you to do so responsibly. Be aware of health, safety and security risks and satisfy yourself that the organisation has sufficient procedures in place.
