### **General Travel Advice**

In January 2024, the Kenya State Department for Immigration and Citizen Services implemented a new policy on a Visa Free Regime in Kenya.

**Visitors to Kenya are required to register on the** [**Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system**](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en) **before entering Kenya.** Some exemptions apply as detailed on the [website of the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/sites/default/files/publication/visa_free_regime_in_kenya.pdf).

The ETA system replaces the previous e-Visa system for Kenya.

A valid passport is required for travel to Kenya. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months and have at least 2 blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

### **Safety**

There is currently increased concern around the possibility of a terrorist attack in Kenya.

The terrorist group Al Shabaab has carried out attacks across Kenya in the past, including in Nairobi, and has threatened further attacks.

As a result, Irish citizens in Kenya are urged to exercise extreme vigilance and caution, particularly in public places locations frequented by tourists/foreigners, including hotels, bars and restaurants, sporting events, supermarkets and shopping centers, beach resorts, government buildings, international schools, buses, trains and other transport hubs including airports. There is a heightened risk of terrorist incidents during public and religious holidays.

**Citizens should also note:**

* Avoid non-essential travel within 75km of the Kenya-Somalia border due to the very high risk of terrorist activity and kidnapping in the region.
* There is an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Naivasha, Nanyuki, Meru, Narok and in coastal areas such as Lamu county and coastal areas of Tana River and Kilifi counties.
* If travelling to Lamu Island or Manda Island, do so by air to Lamu Airport and not via road.
* The Government of Kenya is concerned about escalating insecurity in Laikipia West. It has intensified security operations the Olmoran and Laikipia Nature Conservancy following attacks by armed bandits.
* The Nairobi suburbs of Buruburu, Eastleigh, Kasarani, Kibera, Mathare, Pangani, South B and South C have high rates of crime.
* Incidents of violent crime are high throughout Kenya, including robberies, carjacking, and kidnapping. We advise Irish citizens travelling to large cities such as Nairobi or Mombasa to be extra vigilant. Ask for the Irish Embassy be informed if involved in any incident where a police response is required.
