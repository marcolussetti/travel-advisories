## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

In January 2024, the Kenya State Department for Immigration and Citizen Services implemented a new policy on a Visa Free Regime in Kenya.

**Visitors to Kenya are required to register on the** [**Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system**](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en) **before entering Kenya.** Some exemptions apply as detailed on the [website of the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/sites/default/files/publication/visa_free_regime_in_kenya.pdf).

The ETA system replaces the previous e-visa system for Kenya

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Kenya and have at least 2 blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

### **Money**

The currency in Kenya is Kenya Shilling and it is used for most transactions. Prices for hotels and safaris are usually quoted in US dollars but can also be paid in Kenya Shillings. US dollars are generally not accepted elsewhere.

ATM machines and currency exchange offices are widely available.

### **Dual nationality**

Irish citizens who are also citizens of Kenya must register their second nationality with the government. Please check with the closest Kenyan Embassy to you for details.
