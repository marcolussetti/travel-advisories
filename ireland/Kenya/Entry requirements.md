## Entry requirements

### Visa

In January 2024, the Kenya State Department for Immigration and Citizen Services implemented a new policy on a Visa Free Regime in Kenya.

**Visitors to Kenya are required to register on the** [**Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system**](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en) **before entering Kenya.** Some exemptions apply as detailed on the [**website of the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority**](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/sites/default/files/publication/visa_free_regime_in_kenya.pdf).

The ETA system replaces the previous e-visa system for Kenya.

### **Passport**

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Kenya and have at least 2 blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

### **Dual Nationality**

Irish citizens who are also citizens of Kenya must register their second nationality with the government. Please check with the closest Kenyan Embassy to you for details.
