## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

Political violence can occur in Kenya and demonstrations are common. Irish citizens travelling to Kenya should always monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. Always avoid demonstrations, as they may turn violent.

Outbreaks of violence between tribal groups, usually around land or livestock disputes, can occur from time-to-time in rural areas, particularly in Western and North Western Kenya. Irish citizens are advised to exercise caution, to monitor the Embassy travel advice, and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Terrorism**

There is a high risk of terrorist incidents within Kenya. A Somali terrorist group, Al-Shabaab, has carried out a large number of terrorist attacks in Kenya in recent years, which have targeted military, police and civilians and resulted in major loss of life. Most terrorist activity has centred on the North Eastern part of Kenya and the coastal area, but major attacks have taken place in Nairobi in the past and there is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout Kenya.

There is an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Naivasha, Nanyuki, Meru, Narok and in coastal areas such as Lamu county. Potential targets include areas where westerners gather such as hotels, bars, restaurants, sporting events, supermarkets, shopping centres, beach resorts, government buildings, airports, western embassies, international schools, buses, trains and other transport hubs.

Attacks can occur at any time.  We advise Irish citizens to remain particularly vigilant during public and religious holidays, as there is a heightened risk of terrorist incidents.

There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent years:

* In January 2020, Al Shabaab launched an attack at a Kenya Defence Force Military Base in Manda May in Lamu County. This attack resulted in Lamu airport closing for a time.
* In January 2019, there was an attack on a Hotel in the Riverside area of Nairobi resulting in loss of life.
* In 2015, an attack on Garissa University resulted in the deaths of at least 148 people.
* In 2013, an attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi resulted in the deaths of over 60 people, including foreign nationals.
* In 2012, there was an attack at a sports bar in Mombasa.

We advise Irish citizens to remain vigilant in all public places, and in the event of an attack, to follow any alerts issued by the authorities, leave the area immediately if safe to do so, and avoid returning in the aftermath in case of a follow up attack.

Advice on what actions to take in the event of a terrorist attack is available on the [**UK’s Counter Terrorism Police website**](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/).

### **Kidnapping**

Kidnapping is a risk throughout Kenya, particularly in areas close to the Somali border. There have been several cases of westerners’ kidnapped recently included two Cuban doctors and an Italian NGO worker.

### **Crime**

Violent crime is common in Kenya and perpetrators are often armed. You should be aware of your surroundings at all times. We advise victims of crime to cooperate with all demands to avoid the risk of injury and report the matter to the nearest police station. When travelling in a vehicle keep doors and windows locked. Only travel by foot in areas where it is safe to do so and we advise against travelling by foot after dark. Most hotel rooms have a safe to store valuables.

The Nairobi suburbs of of Buruburu, Eastleigh, Kasarani, Kibera, Mathare, Pangani, South B and South C have high rates of crime.

Be extra vigilant in the Central Business District.

There is a danger of mob justice at the scenes of criminal activity before the arrival of the police.

Thieves may be disguised as police officers or private security. Ask to see ID if approached.

Never leave drinks unattended, or accept drinks from strangers due to the risk they may have been spiked, putting you in danger of sexual assault or robbery.

If travelling to and from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport it is advisable to use the Mombasa road due to the threat of carjacking on other routes. Allow plenty of time to arrive at the airport.

In the Mombasa area, avoid the area around the Likoni ferry after dark.

Home invasions are a risk for those living in Kenya. If you live in Kenya, ensure you have strong personal security measures in place.

It is important to seek a doctor immediately in the case of a sexual assault due to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in Kenya.

### **Driving**

Road conditions and driving practices in Kenya can be hazardous, even in major urban centres. We strongly advise against undertaking long overland journeys, especially at night. If using a hire car or vehicle, ensure the roadworthiness of the vehicle and the reliability of the driver, before departure.

An international driving licence is required for overseas visitors.

### **Public Transport**

Private licenced operators operate most public transport in Kenya. Vehicles can be in poor condition and accidents are common, which can result in serious injuries and fatalities. Matatus (public buses) and Boda boda (motorcycle taxis) can be especially dangerous.

Pick pocketing and theft on public transport is common. Pay close attention to belongings at transport hubs and on vehicles such as trains and buses.

Only use well-marked and reputable taxis when travelling in Kenya.

### **Border regions**

Avoid non-essential travel within 75km of the Kenya-Somalia border due to the very high risk of terrorist activity in the region.

There is a risk of inter-tribal tensions at the northern borders of Kenya.

If travelling to Lamu or Manda Island travel by air rather than by road.

### **Safari**

If in Kenya on Safari, ensure to stay in camps with good perimeter security, seeking advice from the Kenya Tourism Federation (+ 254 20 8001000) or a tour operator if in doubt, and always follow any advice from park wardens.

There remains a serious threat of piracy if sailing in coastal waters off Somalia, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.
