## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Barbados.

All travellers need to complete an Immigration and Customs electronic form prior to arrival in Barbados. The portal to complete the form is available at [**Barbados - Online Immigration & Customs Portal**](https://www.travelform.gov.bb/)

Visitors will be asked to show proof of completion of these forms to the Immigration Officer reviewing your passport on arrival. You can show either a digital copy or printed copy of the forms on arrival.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Barbados. Irish passports should have a validity beyond their length of stay and onward tickets are required for all visitors. Passport cards cannot be used.
