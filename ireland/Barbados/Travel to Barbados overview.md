Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Barbados.

A valid passport is required for travel to Barbados. Irish passports should have a validity beyond their length of stay and onward tickets are required for all visitors. Passport cards cannot be used.

All travellers need to complete an Immigration and Customs electronic form prior to arrival in Barbados. The portal to complete the form is available at [**Barbados - Online Immigration & Customs Portal**](https://www.travelform.gov.bb/)

Visitors will be asked to show proof of completion of these forms to the Immigration Officer reviewing your passport on arrival. You can show either a digital copy or printed copy of the forms on arrival.

Visitors to Barbados are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy of Ireland, USA on [**social media**](https://linktr.ee/embassyofirelandusa) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
