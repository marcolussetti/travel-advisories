Irish citizens require a visa to enter Zimbabwe. Please be advised that the Embassy of Zimbabwe in London has stopped issuing all types of visas at the Embassy. Irish passport holders are now required to obtain visas at the Port of Entry upon arrival in Zimbabwe.

A valid passport is required for travel to Zimbabwe and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the intended date of departure from Zimbabwe. Passport cards cannot be used. Passports must have at least two blank pages and must not be damaged in any way. If your passport fails on either count, it will be not be accepted by the Zimbabwean authorities.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry Requirements tab.

Visitors to Zimbabwe are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in South Africa on X[**@IrishEmbassyPretoria**](https://x.com/IrlEmbPretoria) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
