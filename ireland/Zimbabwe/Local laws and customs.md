## Local laws and customs

It is illegal to make derogatory or insulting comments about the President or to carry material considered to be offensive to the Presidentâ€™s office.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Identification**

Always carry identity documentation or a copy of your passport. You are not allowed to hold a Zimbabwean and a foreign passport at the same time, and you may be prosecuted if you are found to have both.

### **Taking photographs**

Unless granted special permission by the Ministry of Information, it is illegal to take pictures of government offices, airports, military establishments, official residences and embassies, along with other sensitive facilities.

Photographing police officers, members of the armed forces, demonstrations and protests is not permitted, and laws are strictly enforced.
