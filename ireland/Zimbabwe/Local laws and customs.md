## Local laws and customs

It is illegal to make derogatory or insulting comments about the President or to carry material considered to be offensive to the President’s office.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Identification**

Always carry identity documentation or a copy of your passport. You are not allowed to hold a Zimbabwean and a foreign passport at the same time, and you may be prosecuted if you are found to have both.

### **Taking Photographs**

Unless granted special permission by the Ministry of Information, it is illegal to take pictures of government offices, airports, military establishments, official residences and embassies, along with other sensitive facilities.

Photographing police officers, members of the armed forces, demonstrations and protests is not permitted, and laws are strictly enforced.

### **Money**

Zimbabwe’s economic situation continues to be unstable. Both the Zimbabwe Dollar and US Dollar are currently used. This may change without notice. There is a shortage of physical cash so it is not always possible to make cash withdrawals using an international bankcard. Clarification on acceptable payment methods should always be sought in advance from hotels and other outlets. Visit the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe website at [**www.rbz.co.zw**](https://www.rbz.co.zw/) for daily exchange rate values in relation to the major currencies.

Availability of fuel can be unreliable. Payment is usually made in cash; most filling stations do not accept international cards.

### **Mobile Phone Coverage**

Mobile phone service outside the main towns can be poor.
