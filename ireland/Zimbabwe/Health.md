### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Healthcare facilities**

The standard of healthcare, even in private hospitals, varies widely in Zimbabwe. Private healthcare facilities are expensive and the cost of evacuation can be high.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is prevalent in most parts of the country, particularly in low lying border areas including the Zambezi Valley, Victoria Falls, Hwange National Park in the low lying parts of the Eastern Highlands and the Vumba, around Mutare. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether anti-malarial medication is needed. Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Cholera**

Cholera outbreaks are still being reported in various regions in Zimbabwe. Although it is difficult to be certain of numbers, it is clear that hundreds of deaths were associated with the outbreak in 2009.

### **HIV and AIDS**

The level of HIV and AIDS infection in Zimbabwe is very high. Visitors should exercise caution if engaging in activities that expose them to possible infection. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, seek immediate medical attention.

### **Other illnesses**

Other water-borne, food-borne and infectious diseases (including hepatitis, tuberculosis, measles, typhoid and rabies) are prevalent in Zimbabwe, with more serious outbreaks occurring from time to time. Use good personal hygiene practices and take all necessary precautions; avoid raw and undercooked food.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but information on vaccinations can be obtained from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

If on medication bring enough of it to last your trip and for any unexpected delays because particular medication may not be available from local pharmacies.

### **Water**

We advise visitors to drink only bottled, chlorinated or boiled water, avoid ice cubes and maintain strict hygiene standards while travelling in Zimbabwe.
