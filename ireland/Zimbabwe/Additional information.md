## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visa**

Please be advised that the Embassy of Zimbabwe in London has stopped issuing all types of visas at the Embassy. Irish passport holders are now required to obtain visas at the Port of Entry upon arrival in Zimbabwe.

The Schedule of Visa Fees at the Port of Entry in Zimbabwe is as follows:

Irish Nationals

* Single Entry Visa: US$55
* Double Entry Visa: US$75
* Multiple Entry Visa: US$90

### **Passports**

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Zimbabwe.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Zimbabwe and to also carry a photocopy at all times.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

A police report is required to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide a new travel document without a police report.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice and assistance in applying for new passport.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Zimbabwe there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new travel document.

Citizens should contact the Irish Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa to find out what is needed to apply for a new travel document.

### **Journalists**

Journalists are legally obliged to obtain a visa before travelling to Zimbabwe, although requests for visas by journalists are often refused by the Zimbabwean authorities.

Journalists who travel to Zimbabwe without a visa are liable to be arrested and prosecuted.

### **Climate**

The climate in Zimbabwe is tropical but it varies according to altitude. The rainy season runs from November to March. Drought is common in Zimbabwe. Floods and severe storms are rare.

### **Mobile phone coverage**

Mobile phone service outside the main towns can be poor.
