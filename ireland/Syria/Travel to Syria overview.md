## Travel to Syria overview

### **Security status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

Following a decade of conflict and insecurity, Syria remains volatile and dangerous. If you are currently in Syria, we strongly advise you to leave immediately while this is still possible. Ireland has no Embassy in Syria, and if the Honorary Consulate has to close at short notice, it is extremely unlikely that we will be able to provide any consular assistance to Irish citizens in Syria.

We cannot guarantee that documents sent to or from the Honorary Consul in Damascus will reach their destination safely.

The decision to travel is solely your responsibility and you are responsible for your personal safety for the duration of your trip. Continue to monitor this travel advice for updates.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Syria, however the Embassy of Syria in London is temporarily closed.

A valid passport is required for travel to Syria. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of three months from the date of entry into Syria. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Syria are strongly advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Cairo on X [**@IRLEmbCairo**](https://twitter.com/IRLEmbCairo) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The ongoing conflict has seriously affected public infrastructure and services. You can try contacting the emergency services in Syria by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 112
* Ambulance: 110
