## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Syria is a conservative society, and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Avoid public displays of affection, dress conservatively (women's clothes should cover their legs and upper arms), be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Local Laws**

While you are in Syria, you are subject to local laws, including ones that may seem harsh by Irish standards. In the current environment foreigners, as well as Syrians, may be subject to arbitrary arrest and detention by the Syrian authorities. Getting information or providing consular assistance in these cases is extremely difficult.

Parents in particular should be aware that local laws regarding custody, etc. of children are significantly different to those in force in Ireland. If you are involved in any local legal matters, particularly family law, we strongly advise you to get professional advice.

### **Illegal Drugs**

The punishment for possession of drugs is life imprisonment. Â For drug trafficking, the death penalty applies.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal in Syria. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Photography near military and many other government installations is prohibited. Given the widespread nature of the current conflict, you should consider all areas as politically sensitive and therefore avoid photography completely.

### **Money**

It is illegal to change money on the street so only change money in recognised exchange shops, banks and hotels. Credit cards are not widely used in Syria.

As a result of international sanctions, financial institutions in several countries have suspended their transactions with Syria. This may affect your ability to make payments, withdraw cash from ATMs, etc. Please check with your bank/credit institution for further details. There have also been restrictions placed on financial transactions by the Syrian government.
