## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Syria, however the Embassy of Syria in London is temporarily closed.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Syria. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of three months from the date of entry into Syria. Passport cards cannot be used.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Syria and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Health**

There have been reported cases of cholera across the country. Cholera is a bacterial disease transmitted through contaminated drinking water or food. Drink only boiled or bottled water and ensure that food has been properly prepared. Additional information on cholera can be found here: [**Cholera (who.int)**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera?gclid=CjwKCAjw2OiaBhBSEiwAh2ZSP6HKyQ2WUlK-7iA1QXq6KCAOXP4O_MjQhjZ_V0gz5HRx4BN4c76AchoCJCgQAvD_BwE).

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/VaccinePreventable/Polio/Guidance/).

### **Money**

It is illegal to change money on the street so only change money in recognised exchange shops, banks and hotels. Credit cards are not widely used in Syria.

As a result of international sanctions, financial institutions in several countries have suspended their transactions with Syria. This may affect your ability to make payments, withdraw cash from ATMs, etc. Please check with your bank/credit institution for further details. There have also been restrictions placed on financial transactions by the Syrian government.
