## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Sri Lanka, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in India.

If you require emergency assistance from the Embassy, please contact us on: +91 (11) 49403200.

If you call outside normal working hours, you will be asked to leave a message on the answering machine.

Monday to Friday 09:00-13:30 and 14:30-17:00
