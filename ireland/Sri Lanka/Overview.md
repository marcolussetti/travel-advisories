## Overview

### **Security status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

We regret that our Honorary Consulate in Colombo is temporarily closed and cannot provide consular services. Irish citizens in Sri Lanka in need of assistance are advised to contact the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi.

### **Political and Economic Situation**

Sri Lanka is experiencing an economic crisis and since 2022, there have been shortages of essential goods such as food, fuel and medicines. **The supply of goods has stabilised, but could deteriorate again. Irish citizens should ensure that they:**

* **Have appropriate travel insurance for their stay in Sri Lanka.**
* **Take a sufficient supply of any necessary medication before travelling.**

The security situation in Sri Lanka is also stable, but violent incidents occurred during demonstrations in 2022. Irish citizens should remain vigilant and avoid protests, demonstrations and crowds.

While in Sri Lanka, please follow the instructions of local authorities, carry relevant identification and travel documentation at all times, and keep informed of any restrictions on movement put in place by closely following local media.

Irish citizens in Sri Lanka are encouraged [**to register their details**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens planning on going to Sri Lanka must have a visa. The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme has been reinstated and citizens travelling to Sri Lanka should [apply online](https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/), a few days in advance of their trip. Approval should be granted within 24 hours. Should you wish to extend your visa, please contact the [Immigration and Emigration department](https://www.immigration.gov.lk/index_e.php).

A valid passport is required for travel to Sri Lanka. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Sri Lanka are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in India on social media (X [**@IrlEmbIndia**](https://x.com/irlembindia) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinIndia/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
