## Natural disasters and climate

### **Rain and flooding**

Inland flooding and landslides happen frequently in the rainy seasons. Be aware that there are two different rainy seasons in Sri Lanka: May to August in the South West, and November to February in the North East.

During the rainy season consult your tour operator or accommodation provider before travelling, and monitor local media for weather warnings.

### **Tsunami**

The December 2004 tsunami killed more than 30,000 people and caused extensive damage in the south western, southern and eastern coasts of Sri Lanka. Be alert for tsunami warnings that may be issued by the authorities.
