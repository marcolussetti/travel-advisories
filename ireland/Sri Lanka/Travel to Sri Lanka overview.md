## Travel to Sri Lanka overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) Technical Issue**

**The Department of Immigration and Emigration in Sri Lanka have advised that the online ETA system is currently experiencing technical difficulties. As a result, there are delays in the approval of some ETA applications.**

**If you have made an ETA application, please carry proof of this with you when traveling, as airline staff or immigration officials may request it. Upon verification of the ETA application, as long as the standard entry requirements are met and required supporting documentation is in order, your visa will be issued.**

**Please see full details regarding the notice from the Sri Lankan Government** [**here**](https://srilankahc.uk/2026/02/18/notice-to-all-eta-applicants/)**.**

#### **Extreme Weather**

On 27 November, Cyclone Ditwah caused severe flooding and landslides across the country. This resulted in fatalities, damage to infrastructure and travel disruptions. These disruptions continue in the most affected areas including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and the wider Hill Country, and the risk of further landslides and flooding remains.

The south coast of Sri Lanka remains largely unaffected and is operating as normal.

Sri Lanka Tourism has a 24-hour hotline available on 1912 and Disaster Management Centre (DMC) for road related issues (landslides) is 177.

Irish citizens are advised to monitor local news updates, follow the instructions of local authorities and contact their airlines or tour operators for up to date information.

#### **Honorary Consulate in Colombo**

We regret that our Honorary Consulate in Colombo is temporarily closed and cannot provide consular services. Irish citizens in Sri Lanka in need of assistance are advised to contact the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi.

#### **Political and Economic Situation**

Sri Lanka is experiencing an economic crisis and since 2022, there have been shortages of essential goods such as food, fuel and medicines. **The supply of goods has stabilised, but could deteriorate again. Irish citizens should ensure that they:**

* **Have appropriate travel insurance for their stay in Sri Lanka.**
* **Take a sufficient supply of any necessary medication before travelling.**

The security situation in Sri Lanka is also stable, but violent incidents occurred during demonstrations in 2022. Irish citizens should remain vigilant and avoid protests, demonstrations and crowds.

While in Sri Lanka, please follow the instructions of local authorities, carry relevant identification and travel documentation at all times, and keep informed of any restrictions on movement put in place by closely following local media.

Irish citizens in Sri Lanka are encouraged [**to register their details**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens planning on going to Sri Lanka must have a visa. The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme has been reinstated and citizens travelling to Sri Lanka should [**apply online**](https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/), a few days in advance of their trip. Approval should be granted within 24 hours. Should you wish to extend your visa, please contact the [**Immigration and Emigration department**](https://www.immigration.gov.lk/index_e.php).

A valid passport is required for travel to Sri Lanka. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Sri Lanka are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
