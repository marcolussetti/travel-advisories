## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as some behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal identification**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling. During your stay carry a photocopy of your passport, as Sri Lankan laws require persons to carry photo identification with them at all times.

### **Illegal drugs**

Penalties for possession, dealing and trafficking drugs are severe and include the death penalty.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality is illegal in Sri Lanka. Caution and discretion is advised at all times.

### **Clothing**

Be sensitive to local norms of dress and sensibilities. Nude or topless sunbathing is generally not allowed. Dress modestly when visiting religious shrines or temples.

### **Photography**

It is not permitted to take photographs near government or military establishments. Be respectful when visiting religious shrines or temples. In 2012, three foreign nationals were sentenced to six months in prison with hard labour, suspended for five years, and given a fine for wounding the religious feelings of Buddhists by taking pictures that were deemed insulting. Do not pose for photographs with a statue of Buddha.
