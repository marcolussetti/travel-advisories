## Safety and security

### **Terrorist Attacks**

A number of explosions occurred in Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019, primarily targeting hotels and churches in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. The attacks caused the death of at least 250 people including foreign visitors.

There remains a risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Irish citizens are advised to exercise caution in public places, to avoid large gatherings or demonstrations, keep informed of local news reports and to follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Regional Travel**

Foreign nationals, with the exception of foreign media crews, no longer need to have permission from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence before travelling to the northern districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaittivu and Vavuniya.

However, there is still a heavy military presence in the north and north-east of Sri Lanka. Freedom of movement is possible, but if you are travelling to the north, you may still come across access restrictions around military establishments and areas where demining operations continue. Get up-to-date information on access to a particular village or area from the Sri Lankan Military Liaison Officer (tel: +94 11 2430 860).

### **Landmines**

Unexploded mines and ordnances can be a hazard in the north and north-east of Sri Lanka so obey orders from the security forces and signs warning about the danger from landmines. Do not stray off main routes, particularly in rural areas, and always check with local security authorities before travelling to affected regions.

### **Crime**

While most visits to Sri Lanka are trouble-free, watch out for petty crime such as pick-pocketing, especially in crowded places. Although not very frequent, there have been reports of violent crime against foreigners so always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Credit card fraud has been reported in Sri Lanka so take care of credit and ATM cards. Use cash wherever possible and only use ATMs attached to banks or major hotels. Do not let your credit card leave your sight when using it.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Sri Lanka, report it to the local police immediately. Contact us at the Irish Embassy in New Delhi in India if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Sri Lanka, please be careful. Poor standards of driving and bad road maintenance lead to frequent traffic accidents. If driving, an Irish or international licence alone will not suffice an international driving permit and a Sri Lankan recognition permit is required to drive in Sri Lanka. A recognition permit can be obtained at the AA in Colombo. Make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

Hiring a car is cheap in tourist areas. However, if hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public Transport**

Buses and trains are particularly dangerous modes of transport in Sri Lanka. Consider taking taxis instead, as they are cheap in tourist areas.

### **Water Safety**

Many beaches and coastal areas in Sri Lanka have strong currents, dangerous rip tides and big surf. Always seek local advice before entering the water and be alert to the dangers.
