## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is a threat of terrorism in Côte d'Ivoire. There are terrorist groups operating in Mali and Burkina Faso, which share a border with Côte d’Ivoire. These areas should be avoided as the borders are porous and cross border attacks are possible. There is also a risk of a terrorist attacks elsewhere in Côte d’Ivoire, including the capital Abidjan. Indiscriminate terrorist attacks could target civilian places frequented by tourists and expatriates such as hotels, beaches, churches or other areas where people gather.

We also advise against all but essential travel to the western regions of Côte d'Ivoire within 20 km of the border with Liberia, due to the presence of armed militia groups in the area.

### **Demonstrations**

Visitors should avoid protests and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent.

### **Crime**

There is a risk of armed robbery and violent crime in Côte d'Ivoire as well as petty crime. Visitors are advised to take common-sense precautions and get advice locally about the risks.

Attacks by armed robbers have been reported on the Yamoussoukro to Korogho highway and the Abidjan to Yamoussoukro highway as well as other parts of the country.

### **Driving**

Driving standards and road conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are poor and are below the standard we are used to in Ireland. Avoid driving outside towns and cities at night as roads and vehicles can be poorly lit. During the rainy season travel by road can be treacherous, especially on rural unpaved roads.

### **Swimming**

Ocean currents are very strong along the coast, and many swimming accidents are caused by rip tides. There is no lifeboat service and many drownings occur each year.

### **Practical advice**

* Get advice locally about areas of risk and security concerns
* Take common-sense precautions about safety and security
* Know who to contact in case of an emergency
