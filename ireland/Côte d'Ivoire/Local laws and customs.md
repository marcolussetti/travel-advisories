## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

* Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them
* Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal
* Homosexuality is not illegal in Côte d’Ivoire, but there is no legal recognition of LGBT couples. However, public attitudes may be less tolerant than in Ireland, so you should be discreet.
