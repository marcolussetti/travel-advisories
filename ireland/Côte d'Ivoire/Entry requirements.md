## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Côte d'Ivoire. Further information on how to apply for a visa can be found from the [**Embassy of Côte d’Ivoire in the United Kingdom**](https://royaumeuni.diplomatie.gouv.ci/index.php?lang=en).

Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry and have at least one blank page. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to the Côte d'Ivoire and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Lost Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad contact the [**Irish Embassy in Nigeria**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/) . We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document to get home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is needed to make a claim on travel insurance. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.
