## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in the Côte d’Ivoire, consular assistance is provided via the [Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/).

If urgent assistance is needed, citizens can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

Monday to Thursday 9am to 4pm; Friday 9am to 12pm
