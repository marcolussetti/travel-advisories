## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors must carry their passport at all times. If stopped by the police for a registration (visa) spot check, and you cannot prove your identity with an internationally-recognisable ID, you may be detained by the police until your identity is established.

### **Dual Citizenship**

Dual citizens (Irish citizens who also hold Belarusian citizenship) can only enter and leave Belarus on a valid Belarusian passport. You cannot use your Irish passport, even if you have an appropriate visa.

Dual Irish-Belarusian citizens should be aware that the Irish Embassy can only provide them with consular assistance in Belarus at the discretion of the Belarusian authorities, and this permission may not be granted.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Belarus has severe penalties for drugs-related crimes. The penalties for drug possession range from fines to up to five yearsâ€™ imprisonment. Large-scale drug-related offences can result in imprisonment for between 7 - 15 years.

### **Photography**

Visitors should avoid taking photographs of any government building, military installations, state institutions and uniformed officials.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality is legal under Belarusian law. However, Belarus is a conservative society and the gay/lesbian scene is very low profile and few homosexuals openly declare themselves. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Money**

We advise visitors to carry a mix of US Dollars and Euros when travelling to Belarus and make sure to have enough money for the duration of your stay. The number of ATMs is steadily increasing in major cities. Credit cards are not widely used but some large stores and restaurants will take them and you can use them to withdraw cash at major hotels and banks.

### **Currency**

Only exchange foreign currency at Government-licensed booths, found in or near major stores, hotels, banks and all shopping centres. Non-compliance can result in fines and/or arrest.
