## Additional information

### **Visas**

If unsure of the entry requirements for Belarus, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the Embassy of Belarus in London. You can also check with them for how long your passport must be valid.

Irish citizens travelling to Belarus require a visa. For details of how to obtain a visa, please contact the Embassy of Belarus in London. If you planning to enter and leave Belarus through Minsk airport and will be staying in Belarus for no more than thirty days, a visa is not required. **However, if traveling to Belarus from the Russian Federation or traveling on to the Russian Federation directly from Belarus, a visa must be obtained.**

If only one parent/guardian is travelling with a child to, or from, Belarus, a translated (if not originally written in Belarusian or Russian) and notarised signed letter from the other parent/guardian, giving permission for the child to travel, will be required by the Belarusian authorities. If this letter is notarised in Ireland, an Apostille will be required from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin. Please see the section “Authentication of Documents” for more information about Apostilles.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you.

### **Registration**

If staying more than three days in Belarus, you must register with the local police office (OVIR) in the district where you are staying. If staying in an hotel, this will be done on your behalf. If not staying in an hotel, this must be organised by your host. There are fines for not registering in time.

### **Money**

We advise visitors to carry a mix of US Dollars and Euros when travelling to Belarus and make sure to have enough money for the duration of your stay. The number of ATMs is steadily increasing in major cities. Credit cards are not widely used but some large stores and restaurants will take them and you can use them to withdraw cash at major hotels and banks.

### **Currency**

Only exchange foreign currency at Government-licensed booths, found in or near major stores, hotels, banks and all shopping centres. Non-compliance can result in fines and/or arrest.
