## Travel to Belarus overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to Belarus at this time due to the wider security environment in the context of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, regular politically-motivated detention of foreigners by the Belarusian regime, and the increasingly restricted options for Irish citizens in Belarus to depart the country. Dual-citizens who are eligible for military service in Belarus should be aware of the likelihood of facing exit restrictions.

Due to the aforementioned conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, flights to and from Minsk are now very limited. Irish citizens wishing to leave Belarus should do so immediately via the land borders with Latvia, Lithuania, or Poland. Please note that a number of land border crossings between Belarus and EU Member States have been closed in recent times, and following a decision of the Lithuanian Government in February 2024, it is anticipated that fewer permits will be issued in future to Belarusian and Lithuanian carriers operating regular international passenger transportation services (e.g. buses).

The following border crossings for passenger vehicles remain in operation but may be subject to closure at short notice in the future:

Latvia: Paternieki

Lithuania: Medininkai, Šalčininkai

Poland: Terespol, Kuznica, Bobrovnik

As of 19 July 2024, a visa is not required for Irish citizens who will be staying in Belarus for no more than thirty days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Belarus. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of at least three months beyond scheduled departure date. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Belarus are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Vilnius on social media (X@[**IrishEmbVilnius**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbVilnius) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyofIrelandVilnius/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Belarus by dialling emergency numbers:

* Police: 102
* Rescue and Fire brigade: 101
* Ambulance: 103
