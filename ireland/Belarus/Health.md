### **Medical Insurance**

Under Belarusian law, visitors must have medical insurance that covers the period of their stay. If bought outside Belarus, you must be able to show the Belarusian authorities that your policy is valid in Belarus for the duration of your visit and that it provides emergency treatment cover of at least US$5,000. Even with this, it can still be difficult to persuade local officials that a policy obtained abroad meets these criteria.

Foreign visitors must also pay a mandatory state insurance of 0.50 US Dollars per day, at the port of entry.

If visitors arrive at a port of entry without insurance documentation, they will have to buy medical insurance from a State vendor at a cost of approximately 1 USD per day. This insurance is designed only to compensate local medical institutions for the costs of treating visitors. It does not provide protection for you and should not be considered as an alternative to comprehensive travel insurance. Some Belarusian hotels will not let you stay if you do not have State medical insurance.

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Visitors should know most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Belarus are required.

### **Medical Facilities**

Standards of healthcare are well below that of Ireland and you should bring enough essential personal medications to last for your stay, as you may not be able to get supplies in Belarus.

### **Radiation**

Avoid certain foodstuffs (primarily local dairy produce, forest mushrooms and fruits of the forest), which can carry high levels of radiation as a result of contamination from the Chernobyl disaster.

### **Water**

Do not drink village well water as it is usually heavily contaminated with impurities. In cities, first boil, then filter tap water before drinking. We recommend to buy bottled water, which is widely available in shops.
