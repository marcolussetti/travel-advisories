## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Belarus, consular assistance is provided via the [**Embassy of Ireland in Lithuania**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/lithuania/vilnius/).

Please note if urgent assistance is required while the Embassy is closed, please contact the Embassy Duty Officer on +370 6551 5235. Please note this number is monitored outside of office hours only.

Monday to Friday 10:00 and 12:00 and between 14:00 and 16:00
