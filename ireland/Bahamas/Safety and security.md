## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Bahamas is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Bahamas but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Petty Theft**

Beware of pickpockets, muggers and bag snatchers, especially in areas where large numbers of people crowd together. Keep all valuables safe, secure and out of sight.

It’s not advisable to walk outside the main hotels, tourist areas, beaches and downtown Nassau, particularly after dark. The motive for attacks on tourists is usually robbery. In such cases, don’t attempt to resist.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in the Bahamas, report it to the local police immediately.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in the Bahamas, you should be extremely careful. Traffic keeps to the left as in Ireland, however, most vehicles in the Bahamas are imported from the United States and are therefore left hand drive. If you want to drive:

* Bring your international or full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Visitors should use only clearly marked taxis with yellow license plates.

### **Extreme Weather in the Caribbean Region**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/). Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections.

### **Swimming**

Take great care at all times when swimming as currents can be strong.
