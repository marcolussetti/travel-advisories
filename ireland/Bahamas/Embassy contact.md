## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in the Bahamas, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the Irish Embassy in [**Ottawa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/canada/ottawa/)**.**

If you need urgent assistance outside of working hours Monday to Friday, you can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

If you need urgent assistance during the weekend or on a public holiday, contact the Embassy and leave a message.

Monday to Friday from 10.00am to 12.00pm and from 2.00pm until 4.00pm
