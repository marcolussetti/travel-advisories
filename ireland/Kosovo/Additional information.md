## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

### **Visas**

You don’t need a visit visa to enter Kosovo for periods of up to 90 days. However, you may have to provide documentary evidence stating the purpose of your visit. A 90-day entry stamp will be issued and this can be renewed for longer stays.

### **Passports**

Irish passports should be valid for the dates of entry and exit from Kosovo. It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

### **Serbia entry requirements**

As there are ongoing difficulties in travelling between Serbia and Kosovo, we advise you to make alternative arrangements. Serbian authorities will not allow you to travel into Serbia, from Kosovo, unless you began your journey in Serbia and are returning there directly. In 2008, the Serbian government took the decision not to recognise the Republic of Kosovo’s exit/entry stamps, cancelling these at the entry point into Serbia and replacing them with a Serbian border stamp.
