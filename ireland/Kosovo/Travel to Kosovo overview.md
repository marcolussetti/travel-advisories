## Travel to Kosovo overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

While the overall security situation remains calm in most of the country, there are ongoing tensions in northern Kosovo and violence can flare up in the city of Mitrovica without warning. Any Irish citizens already in Kosovo are advised against travel to northern Mitrovica and to the northern municipalities of Leposavic, Zubin Potok and Zvecan as there is an increased risk of disturbance in these areas.

For further information read the safety and security section of this page.
