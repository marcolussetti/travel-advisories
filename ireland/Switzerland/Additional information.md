## Additional information

### **Mobile phone charges**

As Switzerland is not in the EU or EEA (European Economic Area), roaming charges are not covered by the EU Roaming Regulation. As a result, call charges to and from Irish mobile phones can be high. Check with your mobile provider before travelling to Switzerland.

### **Climate**

Switzerland has a continental climate, which is also influenced by the Alps. Cold and dry northerly winds can make temperatures drop very quickly, even in clear weather. The Alps act as a barrier – southern Switzerland, is influenced by the Mediterranean and has a much milder climate than northern Switzerland. The mountains make for spectacular differences in the weather among different regions. It is common to move from a cold and cloudy landscape to a beautiful clear blue sky in just a few minutes. Monitor regional weather forecasts and take local advice.

### **Snow and avalanches**

Avalanches, snow drifts, flash floods and mudslides are a danger in alpine areas. The weather in the mountains is unpredictable and can change suddenly. Monitor local weather and safety conditions, follow advice from local authorities, equip yourself appropriately, plan your activities carefully and inform someone of your plans. You should also observe all written warnings and notices and stick to marked slopes and trails. Ensure that your travel insurance covers you for all activities you plan to try.

### **Travelling with children**

To avoid delays when arriving or departing, the Swiss [**State Secretariat for Migration (SEM)**](https://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/themen/einreise/faq.html#3.Border-crossing/Travel%20documents) recommends that unaccompanied minors, or those travelling with only one parent or legal guardian, carry a letter of consent from the absent parent or guardian. The letter should contain details of the parent/guardian, and attach a copy of the parent's/guardian's valid passport or ID.
