## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Switzerland.

### **Passport**

Irish citizens need a valid passport to enter Switzerland.

### **Staying for Longer than Three Months**

If you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the local authority (Commune or Gemeinde).

### **Travelling with Children**

To avoid delays when arriving or departing, the Swiss [**State Secretariat for Migration (SEM)**](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/einreise/faq.html#-669070280) recommends that unaccompanied minors, or those travelling with only one parent or legal guardian, carry a letter of consent from the absent parent or guardian. The letter should contain details of the parent/guardian, and attach a copy of the parent's/guardian's valid passport or ID.
