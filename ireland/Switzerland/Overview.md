### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Switzerland.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK, Switzerland or within the EU/EEA. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Switzerland.  However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the local authority (Commune or Gemeinde).

Visitors to Switzerland are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbBerne**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbBerne), [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IRESWITZERLAND/) and [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/embassy-of-ireland-switzerland/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
