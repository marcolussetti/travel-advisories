## Local laws and customs

### **Federal and local laws**

Switzerland is a federal country and each individual canton has its own laws and law enforcement agency. In certain cases, such as traffic regulations, federal law applies.

### **Alcohol**

The drinking age for beer, wine and alcoholic cider is generally 16 (although higher in some cantons or individual shops), while the age for any other alcohol (e.g. spirits, alcopops, etc.) is 18.

### **Illegal drugs**

Possession of drugs carries heavy fines and prison terms in Switzerland, which can vary depending on the amount and type of drugs involved. Any attempt to cross the Swiss border carrying drugs (for instance changing flights in Switzerland via ZÃ¼rich airport) automatically constitutes trafficking charges.
