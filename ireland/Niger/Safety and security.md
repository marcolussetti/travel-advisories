## Safety and security

In July 2023, the Conseil National pour la Sauvegarde de la Patrie (CNSP) launched a military coup which has led to protests and unrest. The situation returned to calm following the coup but violent protests and changes to the security situation can arise quickly and without warning. The Department advises citizens to exercise extreme caution if in the country, stay indoors, avoid unnecessary journeys, keep up to date with local developments, avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings, and observe any local curfews or restrictions. There is the strong potential for the security situation to deteriorate without warning.

There is an underlying threat from terrorism. There is a credible risk that terrorist groups based inside and outside the country may carry out attacks, such as shootings, bombings, and kidnappings. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and may target places where foreigners gather, such as diplomatic premises, conference centres, tourist sites, shopping centres, transport hubs, religious site, hotels and restaurants in the capital.

There may be a heightened risk of attack during festivals, and religious and public holiday periods. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.

Citizens should exercise caution and avoid large political rallies and gatherings, areas of demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. In the event of unrest monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities.

Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe.
