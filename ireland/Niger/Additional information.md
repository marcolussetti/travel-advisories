## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Niger. Further information on how to apply for a visa can be found from the [**Consulate of the Republic of Niger in the United Kingdom**](https://www.nigerconsulate.org.uk/).

Passports should be valid for at least 6Â  months from date of entry and have at least 2 blank pages. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Niger and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

As there is no Irish Embassy in Niger we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Nigeria**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/)**.**

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
