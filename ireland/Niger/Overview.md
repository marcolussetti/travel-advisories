Citizens remaining in the country are advised to be vigilant, avoid unnecessary journeys, keep up to date with local developments, avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings, observe any local curfews or restrictions and to consider stocking up on food, water and fuel. Citizens should also be prepared to leave the country, if possible, at short notice.
