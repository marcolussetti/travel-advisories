### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Yellow fever vaccination certificate must be presented upon arrival.

Check what other vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We canâ€™t advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
