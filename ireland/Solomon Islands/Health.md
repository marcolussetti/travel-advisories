### Health Risks

Malaria and dengue are widespread across Solomon Islands.

Zika virus is also found in Solomon Islands. There's no vaccination for Zika virus.

Infection with Zika virus has been increasingly linked with a serious birth condition called microcephaly where the baby is born with an abnormally small head and/or brain damage. An increase in cases of a neurological illness (called Guillan Barre Syndrome) have also been reported in areas where Zika virus outbreaks have occurred. Irish Citizens are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/) .

Foodborne, waterborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur in Solomon Islands. These include:

* [**hepatitis**](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
