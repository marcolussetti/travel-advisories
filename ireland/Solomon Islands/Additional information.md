### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Currently, citizens of most European countries, do not require a visa to enter the Solomon Islands. Instead, you apply for a visitor’s permit which is valid for up to a 90 day stay.  
In order to be approved for a visitor’s permit, you must:

* a valid foreign passport with at least six month’s validity and have sufficient blank space to accommodate the necessary stamps
* have either a return ticket or an onward ticket
* proof of sufficient funds
* have a valid visa to enter other countries from the Solomon Islands, if required
* If you meet these requirements, you will be granted a permit on arrival.

However, the Embassy recommends that prior to travel you check the up to date entry requirements for the Solomon Islands, including visa and other immigration information from the nearest Embassy or Consulate.

Malaria and dengue are widespread across Solomon Islands.

Zika virus is also found in Solomon Islands. There's no vaccination for Zika virus.

Infection with Zika virus has been increasingly linked with a serious birth condition called microcephaly where the baby is born with an abnormally small head and/or brain damage. An increase in cases of a neurological illness (called Guillan Barre Syndrome) have also been reported in areas where Zika virus outbreaks have occurred. Irish Citizens are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/) .
