## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Currently, citizens of most European countries, do not require a visa to enter the Solomon Islands. Instead, you apply for a visitor’s permit which is valid for up to a 90 day stay.  
In order to be approved for a visitor’s permit, you must:

* a valid foreign passport with at least six month’s validity and have sufficient blank space to accommodate the necessary stamps
* have either a return ticket or an onward ticket
* proof of sufficient funds
* have a valid visa to enter other countries from the Solomon Islands, if required
* If you meet these requirements, you will be granted a permit on arrival.

However, the Embassy recommends that prior to travel you check the up to date entry requirements for the Solomon Islands, including visa and other immigration information from the nearest Embassy or Consulate.

### **Passport**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Solomon Islands and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay. Passports must have at least six months validity.
