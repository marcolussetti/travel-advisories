## Safety and security

### **Civil unrest**

Demonstrations occur regularly, especially in Honiara and Malaita. Civil unrest and political violence may occur.

You should continue to exercise caution and avoid public gatherings and large crowds. Unrest can result from elections or periods of political uncertainty.  Irish citizens are advised to monitor the news, and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Solomon Islands is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates. Unexploded World War II ordnance is still present in certain parts of the Solomon Islands, including Hell’s Point, the ridges behind Honiara, the New Georgia group of islands, the former capital of Tulagi and the Russell Islands.

### **Crime**

While incidents affecting tourists are rare, there is the potential for trouble due to civil unrest and drunken behaviour. However, be aware that both expatriates and visitors can be attractive targets for opportunistic crime. Be vigilant about your personal security, particularly in Honiara and follow these basic safety guidelines:

* Do not carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Take a number of photocopies of your passport with you in case your passport is lost or stolen. Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Women should take care, especially when alone in public areas. If you are arrested or detained, you are entitled to request that the local police notify the [**Irish Embassy in Canberra, in Australia**](/en/australia/canberra/) of your detention.

Crime usually increases:

* after political instability
* around Christmas
* before major holidays
* during times of civil unrest

To protect yourself from crimes:

* lock doors, windows and gates at your accommodation, even if you have security guards
* lock vehicle windows and doors, even when moving

### **Lost or stolen passports**

* Given that the nearest Irish Embassy is a long distance away in Canberra, Australia, dealing with a lost or stolen passport can be extremely inconvenient and can take time to resolve. In emergencies, you can get limited consular assistance from EU partners with Embassies in Honiara.

### **Reporting crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Solomon Islands, report it to the local police immediately, telephone 999. Please note that you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Canberra, in Australia**](/en/australia/canberra/) if you need help.

### **Personal responsibility**

As well as protecting yourself against crime while in the Solomon Islands, you have a responsibility to ensure that your own behaviour is orderly and respectful and does not bring you to the attention of the police

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Solomon Islands, you should be extremely careful. Only a few of the main roads are of reasonable quality, the rest are very heavily potholed and in some areas the bridges have collapsed. Standards of driving and vehicle maintenance are poor.

If you want to drive, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Natural Disasters**

Natural disasters, such as tropical cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis, occur. Listen to Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation on radio station AM1035 for official updates.

A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you’re in the Solomon Islands, familiarize yourself with the region’s evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning.
