### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We canâ€™t advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

### **Yellow Fever**

Irish citizens may be asked to show proof of Yellow Fever vaccination especially when they are travelling from high risk transmission countries, including Uganda.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a constant threat in Angola. Before travelling, ask your doctor about suitable anti-malarial medication. And after arrival, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Cholera**

Cholera is common in Angola. You should drink bottled or boiled and filtered water and eat only where food has been thoroughly cooked and basic hygiene precautions have been taken.

### **Zika**

There is currently an outbreak of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in the region. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/) (HPSC).

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled or bottled water during your stay.
