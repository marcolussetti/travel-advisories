## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Do not use photographic equipment, maps, binoculars or GPS devices near government buildings or installations, as this may result in the confiscation of equipment or fines being imposed.

It is recommended that you carry a certified copy of your passport data page and relevant visa, for identification purposes in the event that you are stopped by the Angolan authorities. Failure to do so may result in a fine.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.
