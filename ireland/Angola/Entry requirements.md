## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

As of 29 September 2023, Irish citizens no longer require a visa to enter Angola, if they are travelling for tourism. Irish citizens can stay for up to 30 days per entry and a maximum of 90 days per year. If visiting Angola for a reason other than tourism, it is still necessary to apply for a visa at an Angolan embassy or consulate. Details on how to apply for a visa and the required documents can be found [**here**](https://consuladogeralangola-uk.org/vistos/).

Travellers can apply for a visa online at [**http://www.smevisa.gov.ao/**](http://www.smevisa.gov.ao/), or alternatively by post or in person at the Consulate General of Angola in London.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Angola. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport if travelling to Angola and to carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re in Angola you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Lisbon**](/en/portugal/lisbon/contact/). We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home.
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
