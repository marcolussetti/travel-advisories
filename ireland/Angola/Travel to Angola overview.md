### **General Travel Advice**

As of 29 September 2023, Irish citizens no longer require a visa to enter Angola, if they are travelling for tourism. Irish citizens can stay for up to 30 days per entry and a maximum of 90 days per year. If visiting Angola for a reason other than tourism, it is still necessary to apply for a visa at an Angolan embassy or consulate.

A valid passport is required for travel to Angola. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

When entering Angola, visitors may be asked to show evidence of vaccination against yellow fever.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry Requirements tab.

Visitors to Angola are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Angola has removed all COVID-19 entry and exit requirements. However, passengers travelling to, or transiting through, Angola are advised to re-confirm the current requirements for travel with their airline and/or travel agent, as these can be subject to change at short notice.
