## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

You do not normally need a visa to enter Singapore for stays of up to 30 days for tourism, business discussions or social visits.

If travelling to or through Singapore, passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the intended date of departure.

If unsure of the entry requirements for Singapore, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Singapore.
