## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is an underlying global threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. The Singaporean Government has put in place extensive measures to combat terrorism and has arrested a number of terrorist suspects.

### **Crime**

Singapore is a relatively safe city, but take basic safety precautions and be aware of the risk of street crime, particularly bag snatching.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of it (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home

### **Reporting a crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Singapore, report it to the local police immediately. Please [**contact us at the Irish Embassy**](/en/singapore/embassy/) if assistance is required.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in Singapore are broadly similar to those in Ireland. Driving is on the left, and the roads are generally good. If involved in an accident, remain at the scene until the police have arrived.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and an international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence in Singapore. The traffic police regularly carry out breath tests. Sentences can include a fine or imprisonment.
* Be aware of Singaporeâ€™s traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Wear seatbelts at all times

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Air travel**

The Singaporean authorities will prosecute cases of air rage within their jurisdiction.

### **Sea travel**

There have been attacks against ships in and around the waters of Singapore and the Malacca Straits. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas onboard and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
