## Health

Health services in Singapore are a high standard.

### **Vaccinations**

Before travelling, check with a doctor if any vaccinations are required.

### **Medical Insurance**

Be sure to have comprehensive medical insurance before travel to Singapore, as treatment and medication can be extremely expensive.

### **Face Masks**

From 13 February 2023, face masks are no longer mandatory in most public areas however they must be worn in healthcare settings.

### **Medication**

Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in Ireland are considered controlled substances in Singapore. Visitors must apply for prior authorisation and a permit at least ten working days before travel from the Singapore Health Sciences Authority in order to bring any such medication into Singapore. For medicines that do not contain a controlled substance, visitors may bring up to three months’ supply into Singapore without prior approval, but must bring supporting documents such as a letter from a doctor or a copy of the prescription as proof that the medicines are for personal use. For more information, please consult the [**Health Sciences Authority**](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/content/hsa/en/Health_Products_Regulation/Consumer_Information/Personal_Import_Regulations/bringing_personal_medication_into_Singapore.html) website. If you have questions please email **hsa\_info@hsa.gov.sg**.

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever is common in Singapore, with 4,000 to 5,000 reported cases every year. Take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes.

### **Yellow Fever**

Yellow fever vaccination is required for travellers who are arriving from, or have transited through, [**countries with risk of yellow fever transmission**](https://www.who.int/health-topics/yellow-fever#tab=tab_1).

### **Air Pollution**

Singapore sometimes experiences high levels of air pollution (‘haze’), from land clearance fires in Indonesia. We advise all Irish visitors and residents to monitor the updates and advisories from the [**Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA)**](http://www.haze.gov.sg/)

### **Customs Regulations**

Importing certain controlled drugs and pirated copyright material is prohibited and there are restrictions on entering with items like replica guns, radio communications equipment, and weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns).
