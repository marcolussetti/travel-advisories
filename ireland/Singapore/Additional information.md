## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

You do not normally need a visa to enter Singapore for stays of up to 30 days for tourism, business discussions or social visits.

If travelling to or through Singapore, passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the intended date of departure.

If unsure of the entry requirements for Singapore, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Singapore.

### **Health**

Health services in Singapore are top-class. Before travelling, check with a doctor if any vaccinations are required. Be sure to also have comprehensive medical insurance before travel to Singapore, as treatment and medication can be extremely expensive.

From 13 February 2023, face masks are no longer mandatory in most public areas however they must be worn in healthcare settings.

### **Medication**

Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in Ireland are considered controlled substances in Singapore. Visitors must apply for prior authorisation and a permit at least ten working days before travel from the Singapore Health Sciences Authority in order to bring any such medication into Singapore. For medicines that do not contain a controlled substance, visitors may bring up to three months’ supply into Singapore without prior approval, but must bring supporting documents such as a letter from a doctor or a copy of the prescription as proof that the medicines are for personal use. For more information, please consult the [**Health Sciences Authority**](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/content/hsa/en/Health_Products_Regulation/Consumer_Information/Personal_Import_Regulations/bringing_personal_medication_into_Singapore.html) website. If you have questions please email **hsa\_info@hsa.gov.sg**.

Dengue fever is common in Singapore, with 4,000 to 5,000 reported cases every year. Take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes.
