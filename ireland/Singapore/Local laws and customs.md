## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Do not get involved with drugs of any kind. There are severe penalties for all drug offences in Singapore. Consumption or possession of even very small amounts can lead to imprisonment. Singapore retains the death penalty for drug trafficking.

### **Personal Identification**

A police permit is required for any outdoor public assembly or procession. Avoid street gatherings and public demonstrations as they might be illegal. Filming an illegal public gathering is also forbidden, as is the wearing or displaying of any ‘cause related’ material without permission.

Always carry personal identification, as you may be asked to show it during your stay by, for example, the police. We advise visitors to carry photocopies of the relevant pages of your passport and arrival card, and keep the originals in a safe place.

### **E-Cigarettes/Vapes**

It is illegal to possess, purchase and use e-cigarettes or vapes in Singapore as of 1 February 2018. Individuals caught using e-cigarettes of vapes can face fines of up to SGD$2,000.

### **Criminal Offences**

Drunk and disorderly conduct is a serious offence in Singapore. Convicted offenders could face fines, imprisonment and/or corporal punishment, depending on the severity of the crime.

If the subject of an investigation, your passport will be confiscated by the authorities and will only be returned once the investigation has concluded. Normally, you will not be permitted to travel during this time. Be aware that investigations can take anywhere from a few days to several months.

### **Outrage of Modesty**

A wide range of offences, including ‘outrage of modesty’ (inappropriate behaviour by men towards women) and vandalism carry corporal punishment (the rattan cane).

‘Outrage of modesty’ (molestation) can result in a fine, imprisonment jail or corporal punishment. Avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation. Scams involving false claims of molestation are thought to exist. Usually once the complaint is made by the victim and the accused is arrested the police will not allow the accused person to travel and their passport will be confiscated while investigations are carried out. This can take several months.

### **Other Criminal Offences**

Approval from the Ministry of Manpower is required for a foreign national to give a talk on ‘racial, communal, religious, caused-related or political topics’.

The public display of national flags or national emblems is illegal except where a specific exemption has been granted.

Penalties for overstaying visas include fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment (the rattan cane) and deportation depending on the length of overstay.

Both public and private Jehovah’s Witness meetings are illegal in Singapore. It is also against the law to possess any Jehovah’s Witness publication, including a Jehovah’s Witness bible. Similar measures exist against the Unification Church.

On-the-spot fines are common, and can be given for a wide range of behaviours which are tolerated in Ireland. Visitors will be fined for smoking in any public place or indoor restaurant, for chewing gum on the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system or littering. It is also illegal to bring chewing gum into the country.

Thorough checks may be carried out on departing travellers’ vehicles and fingerprints may be scanned at border exit points.

The use of false ID is illegal.

There is zero tolerance for bribery. Any attempt to bribe or to otherwise prevent an official from carrying out their duties can result in arrest.
