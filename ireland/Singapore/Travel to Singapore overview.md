## Travel to Singapore overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **General Travel Advice**

All travellers must complete and submit an SGAC declaration up to 3 days before arrival – the form can be found [**here**](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard). Visitors are not required to pay for this declaration so any website which requires a payment is a scam.

If travelling to or through Singapore, passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the intended date of departure.

In general, Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter or transit through Singapore however visitors should not overstay beyond their permission to remain in the country.

Travellers should refer to the following list of [**prohibited items**](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore/what-you-can-bring) that cannot be brought into Singapore.

Short-term visitors to Singapore should have sufficient funds for their stay and may be asked at Immigration to provide details of onward travel.

### **Emergency Assistance**

We suggest learning as much as possible about Singapore before before departing from travel agents, tour operators and guide books. The best help is often close at hand so if problems arise try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services by dialling the following:

* Ambulance 995
* Fire 995
* Police 999
