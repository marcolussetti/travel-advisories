## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

The US Virgin Islands are a territory of the United States. Irish citizens require an [**ESTA**](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/esta) or visa to enter the US.

If you are unsure of the entry requirements for this country, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the country’s nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/).

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to the US. Passport cards cannot be used. Ireland has an agreement with the US that allows you to enter on a current passport up to the actual date of expiration – so your Irish passport needs to be valid only for the duration of your stay in the US.
