## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

We recommend anyone in New Zealand on the one year working holiday scheme to apply for a Kiwi Access card – website [**www.kiwiaccess.co.nz**](http://www.kiwiaccess.co.nz/).  This is an approved photographic ‘evidence of age’ document under the Sale of Liquor Act. The Kiwi Access card is easier to carry than a passport and can be replaced more easily and with less expense if lost or stolen.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Attitudes to alcohol can vary from one society to another and New Zealand is generally more conservative in this regard than often imagined. A number of Irish visitors have spent a night in the police cells in New Zealand having been arrested while under the influence.

While minor indiscretions are dealt with quickly by the courts and will usually be dealt with by a fine, it’s surprisingly easy to get a criminal conviction, and this will have a negative effect on your ability to remain in New Zealand, to re-enter in the future, or to get a visa for other countries.

Be aware of the risk of having drinks spiked and take normal precautions.

Finally, remember that New Zealand Police are strict and will not tolerate disrespectful language or physical contact from members of the public.

### **Outstanding Fines**

It is advisable that Irish citizens pay any outstanding fines, in particular parking fines prior to leaving the country. New Zealand has a policy of stopping travellers from leaving the country until such fines are paid. For your information, there is a threshold amount (which changes from time to time) where travellers will be stopped if their fines exceed that amount.
