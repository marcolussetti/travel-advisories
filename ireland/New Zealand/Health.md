### **Vaccinations**

People intending to travel to New Zealand should be fully immunised for measles. If you need an additional vaccination, it should be administered at least two weeks before arriving in New Zealand. Remember, people who aren't immune and have early symptoms of measles (fever, cough, runny nose, sore eyes and/or a rash) shouldn't travel.

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for New Zealand.
