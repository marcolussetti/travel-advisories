## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish passport holders don’t need a visa to enter New Zealand and, on arrival, may be granted a visitors permit for up to 90 days. You’ll still be required to provide:

* travel tickets or evidence of onward travel arrangements, and
* evidence of funds for maintenance

The New Zealand Government requires a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) for all visiting and transit passengers from Ireland.

The NZeTA can be requested via the official mobile app or website at [**https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta**](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta).

The NZeTA will cost NZD $17 on the mobile app, or NZD $23 online. Visitors will also be required to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL). The IVL costs NZD $35 and is paid at the same time as the NZeTA.

Visitors are advised to apply for the NZeTA at least 72 hours prior to travel in order for it to be processed in good time. The criteria for a successful application can be found [**here**](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/criteria/nzeta?nationality=nationality-IRL&country=residence-IRL).

Visitors who already hold a valid visa, such as Permanent Residents, do not require a NZeTA (or IVL).

### **Passport**

Irish passport holders visiting New Zealand should have a passport that is valid for at least 3 months beyond the date they intend to depart New Zealand.

New Zealand law doesn’t require that you carry your passport with you and, to avoid loss or theft, we advise against doing so unless it is absolutely necessary. It is a good idea to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you during your visit.

### **Biosecurity**

New Zealand has very strict biosecurity procedures at airports and ports to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases of animals and plants. On arrival, you’ll be given a ‘Passenger Arrival Card’ that you will need to fill in before entering New Zealand. This is a legal document. If you break the law by giving false or incorrect declarations it may result in fines or imprisonment.

People failing to declare biosecurity risk goods can receive an instant fine of $400, be fined up to $100,000 and/or face up to five years in prison.

Risk items include food, plants and plant products, live animals, animal products, salt and freshwater products and items associated with water, sporting and camping equipment. A full list of risk goods that must be declared is on the Passenger Arrival Card or from the MAF Biosecurity website. If you have any risk goods you no longer want to keep, put them in the amnesty bins provided at the airport's arrivals area or declare them on your Passenger Arrival Card. The bins are usually your last opportunity to throw away risk goods before entering MAF's Biosecurity area.

On arrival you may see [**MAF Biosecurity Detector**](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/) Dogs that are specially trained to sniff out risk goods. Your bags may also go through an x-ray machine. If any items are found, Biosecurity staff may open your bags for inspection. Make sure that you declare or dispose of any prohibited items before the biosecurity process.
