## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquake**

New Zealand lies along a seismically active area and as such is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity. For advice on what to do in an earthquake, please check the [**Get Thru**](https://getthru.govt.nz/) website for more information.

### **Extreme weather**

When travelling to or through remote areas, we advise you to check on weather conditions before departing and pack equipment and clothing suitable for extremes of weather.  
When travelling through remote areas, make sure you tell the park operators (or someone else) where youâ€™re going and how long you expect to be away. Check [**New Zealand Department of Conservation**](http://www.doc.govt.nz/) for more information about enjoying National Parks and [**MetService**](http://www.metservice.com/national/index) for up-to-date weather forecasts and warnings.
