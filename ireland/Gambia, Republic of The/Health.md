### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that citizens obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that the policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be required for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, information can be obtained from a GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for the entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case your medication is lost.
