## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Paraguay is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

While most visits to Paraguay are trouble-free, violent crime is increasing in areas frequented by tourists and you should take sensible precautions.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid wearing expensive jewellery, carrying handbags or showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* In Asunción, avoid walking near the Presidential Palace or Congress at night, as both are near a slum where foreigners have been victims of assault.
* Be careful in the north-eastern provinces of Amambay and Canindeyu where smuggling is common and violent incidents take place from time to time.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Paraguay, be aware that while some of the county’s principal roads are paved, the quality of the surface varies. Most minor roads are unpaved rough tracks, which can be impassable at times. If visitors want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Know that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Be sure to have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
