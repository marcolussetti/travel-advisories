## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Paraguay has a subtropical climate in the Paraneña region and a tropical climate in the Chaco. The Paraneña region is generally humid, with plenty of rain throughout the year and only moderate seasonal changes in temperature.

During the summer, the dominant influence on Paraquay’s climate is the warm sirocco winds blowing out of the northeast. During the winter, the dominant wind is the cold pampero from the South Atlantic, which blows across Argentina and is deflected northeastward by the Andes in the southern part of that country.
