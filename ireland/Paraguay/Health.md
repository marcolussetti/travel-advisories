## Health

### **Zika Virus**

There is a risk of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

### **Yellow fever**

We recommend yellow fever vaccination for everyone over the age of one who is visiting rural and forested areas of Paraguay, including Iguaçu Falls.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a risk in the southeastern departments of Alto Paraná, Canindeyú, Caaguazú, Caazapá, and Guaira. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether anti-malarial medication is needed. Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Dengue fever**

Dengue is a serious risk in Paraguay, particularly during the warmer months (November to April) and especially in urban areas. Take sensible precautions against mosquito bites.
