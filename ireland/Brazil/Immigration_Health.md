## Immigration/Health

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to visit Brazil as a tourist for periods of up to 90 days. Visitors will, however, have to be able to show that they are a genuine tourist (see below).

On arrival in Brazil, visitors must present a passport that is valid for at least 6 months. In general, on arrival in Brazil visitors should have: proof that they have or have access to sufficient funds (if bringing credit cards, we advise you to carry a statement to prove the limit); a return or onward ticket; and proof of accommodation booked for at least the first night.

On entering Brazil, visitors should ensure your passport is stamped by the immigration authorities and retain a copy of your immigration landing card. These will be reviewed when departing Brazil, and if not presented, a fine may be applied.

If visitors have any other immigration queries, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate.

### **Travelling with Minors**

Brazil has strict laws in relation to Brazilian children leaving the country, with only one parent/guardian. In such cases, the parent/guardian must carry proof that the other parent has consented or proof of sole legal guardianship.

For minors entering/exiting from Brazil, the applicable law is the law of the country of origin of the child. This means that authorisation is not necessarily needed, from the other parent/legal guardian. However the Embassy is aware of several cases where children, who entered Brazil on an Irish passport and with one parent, faced problems trying to exit from Brazil.

The Brazilian immigration authorities will require consent for a child who also has Brazilian citizenship, even when entering/exiting Brazil using an Irish passport. If a child has a Brazilian parent, even when born abroad and without a Brazilian passport, this child is automatically considered a Brazilian citizen and will be subject to the Brazilian legislation when entering/exiting Brazil without one of their parents.

If the parent who will give the consent is a Brazilian citizen, we understand that this consent can be done through the Brazilian Embassy in Dublin. However, if the parent is not Brazilian, the parent’s signature in the consent will need to be recognized by a Public Notary registered in the Brazilian Embassy in Dublin and then afterwards legalized in their Consular Section. Please [**contact the Brazilian Embassy, in Dublin**](http://dublin.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/), for further information in this regard.

If a child is travelling to Brazil with only one parent/legal guardian, the Embassy advises that the parent/legal guardian should carry proof that the other parent has consented or proof of sole legal guardianship. This should be done, irrespective of what passport the child is using to enter Brazil.

### **Vaccinations**

It is mandatory to present certificates of vaccinations against poliomyelitis for children between the ages of three months and six years. Those who have been in certain countries up to three months before travelling to Brazil should present international certificates of vaccination against yellow fever. Vaccinations against yellow fever are available (see below) and Irish citizens are advised to follow guidance of their doctors and on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](http://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/yellowfever/factsheet/) (HPSC).

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for your destination in Brazil are required. In general, visitors should protect themselves from mosquito bites in Brazil as they can carry a range of diseases including malaria, dengue fever and ZIKA virus.

How to protect yourself from mosquitoes:

Find out from local people when local mosquitoes are most likely to be biting.

Avoid areas where mosquitoes are likely to congregate (i.e. stagnant water).

Wear appropriate clothing: long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, boots and socks.

Protect your room: The likelihood of mosquito bites can be reduced by air conditioning, insect-proof screens etc.

Protect your bed: Bed nets and cot nets should be used if rooms are not adequately screened or air conditioned.

Use insect repellents: The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises the use of DEET as a mosquito repellent (including by pregnant women – the risk to an unborn baby, certainly from malaria, would outweigh any potential risk from DEET), if you ensure to (A) use it sparingly, and (B) wash it off when away from risk of biting mosquitoes, as it is a chemical applied to the skin.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a risk in some northern parts of Brazil including much of the Amazon. You may need to take anti-malarial medication, depending on the areas to be visited, and to cover up and use insect repellent in the evening and at night.

### **Dengue fever**

The main risk season for dengue fever is from January to March. There is no effective treatment for this fever, which has severe flu-like symptoms and can sometimes be fatal to the elderly, the very young or people with underlying conditions. As well as getting medical advice before travelling, you should also take advice on local conditions when travelling within Brazil and minimise exposure to mosquito bites by covering up and using insect repellents on exposed skin.

### **Yellow fever**

Mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever virus can be found throughout the Amazon Basin and in forested regions along all major river basins in Brazil, including Iguaçu Falls and as far south as Rio Grande do Sul. In the recent past, outbreaks have also occurred in areas with historically low risk for transmission, including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Vaccinations against yellow fever are available and Irish citizens are advised to follow guidance of their doctors and on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](http://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/yellowfever/factsheet/) (HPSC). It is important to note that vaccinations against yellow fever generally take 10 days to take effect. Those who have been in certain countries up to three months before travelling to Brazil should present international certificates of vaccination against yellow fever.

If you intend to travel onward from Brazil to another country, please note that certain countries may require travellers from Brazil to show proof of yellow fever vaccination.

### **Oropouche virus disease**

Oropouche virus disease spreads via midges and mosquitoes. In 2024, outbreaks were reported in Brazil, with most (though not all) occurring in the Amazon region. The impact of infection for pregnant women could be higher than for the general population, although this is still under investigation. Travellers are advised to follow the personal protective measures set out above.
