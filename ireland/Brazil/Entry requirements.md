## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to visit Brazil as a tourist for periods of up to 90 days. Visitors will, however, have to be able to show that they are a genuine tourist (see below).

On arrival in Brazil, visitors must present a passport that is valid for at least 6 months. In general, on arrival in Brazil visitors should have: proof that they have or have access to sufficient funds (if bringing credit cards, we advise you to carry a statement to prove the limit); a return or onward ticket; and proof of accommodation booked for at least the first night.

On entering Brazil, visitors should ensure your passport is stamped by the immigration authorities and retain a copy of your immigration landing card. These will be reviewed when departing Brazil, and if not presented, a fine may be applied.

If visitors have any other immigration queries, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate.

### **Travelling with Minors**

Brazil has strict laws in relation to Brazilian children leaving the country, with only one parent/guardian. In such cases, the parent/guardian must carry proof that the other parent has consented or proof of sole legal guardianship.

For minors entering/exiting from Brazil, the applicable law is the law of the country of origin of the child. This means that authorisation is not necessarily needed, from the other parent/legal guardian. However the Embassy is aware of several cases where children, who entered Brazil on an Irish passport and with one parent, faced problems trying to exit from Brazil.

The Brazilian immigration authorities will require consent for a child who also has Brazilian citizenship, even when entering/exiting Brazil using an Irish passport. If a child has a Brazilian parent, even when born abroad and without a Brazilian passport, this child is automatically considered a Brazilian citizen and will be subject to the Brazilian legislation when entering/exiting Brazil without one of their parents.

If the parent who will give the consent is a Brazilian citizen, we understand that this consent can be done through the Brazilian Embassy in Dublin. However, if the parent is not Brazilian, the parent’s signature in the consent will need to be recognized by a Public Notary registered in the Brazilian Embassy in Dublin and then afterwards legalized in their Consular Section. Please [**contact the Brazilian Embassy, in Dublin**](http://dublin.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/), for further information in this regard.

If a child is travelling to Brazil with only one parent/legal guardian, the Embassy advises that the parent/legal guardian should carry proof that the other parent has consented or proof of sole legal guardianship. This should be done, irrespective of what passport the child is using to enter Brazil.

### **Customs Restrictions**

If carrying cash of a value R$10, 000 or more, when entering/leaving Brazil, please complete an online declaration called a “Declaração Eletrônica de Bens de Viajantes”, print it off and present it to the Brazilian customs when entering/leaving Brazil. Further information can be found on the [**Receita Federal website**](https://idg.receita.fazenda.gov.br/orientacao/aduaneira/viagens-internacionais/guia-do-viajante).

Brazilian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into, or export from, Brazil of items such as firearms, antiquities, mineral samples, tropical plants, medication, and business equipment. In the Amazon region, there is particular scrutiny of the export of biological material which might have genetic value. People propagating or exporting biological material without proper permits run the risk of being accused of “biopiracy,” which is a serious offense in Brazil. If you have specific queries, you should contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate.

### **Vaccinations**

It is mandatory to present certificates of vaccinations against poliomyelitis for children between the ages of three months and six years. Those who have been in certain countries up to three months before travelling to Brazil should present international certificates of vaccination against yellow fever. Vaccinations against yellow fever are available (see below) and Irish citizens are advised to follow guidance of their doctors and on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](http://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/yellowfever/factsheet/) (HPSC).
