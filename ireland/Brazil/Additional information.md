## Additional information

### **‘Faith healer’**

The Embassy is aware of a number of cases of Irish people travelling to see and be treated for illness by a well-known 'faith healer' in the state of Goias in central Brazil. Some became ill following this treatment and were in need of medical attention. The Embassy strongly cautions that serious consideration be given before embarking on such a trip or allowing any, other than a medical professional, to perform a medical procedure. The public healthcare system in Brazil, especially in the more remote areas, is not of the highest quality.

### **Brazilian Telephones**

If visitors have to use a Brazilian telephone (rather than an Irish mobile) they need to use a carrier, that is, to add an additional two numbers which effectively select through which company the call will be routed.

Thus if, from, say, Rio de Janeiro, you wished to call the Embassy, dial 0+carrier (which can be 21, 14 or 15) followed by 61.3248-8800.

Visitors should contact your Irish mobile phone provider, in advance of their trip, to confirm whether they will be able to receive/make telephone calls or text messages while travelling in Brazil.

### **Customs Restrictions**

If carrying cash of a value R$10, 000 or more, when entering/leaving Brazil, please complete an online declaration called a “Declaração Eletrônica de Bens de Viajantes”, print it off and present it to the Brazilian customs when entering/leaving Brazil. Further information can be found on the [**Receita Federal website**](https://idg.receita.fazenda.gov.br/orientacao/aduaneira/viagens-internacionais/guia-do-viajante).

Brazilian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into, or export from, Brazil of items such as firearms, antiquities, mineral samples, tropical plants, medication, and business equipment. In the Amazon region, there is particular scrutiny of the export of biological material which might have genetic value. People propagating or exporting biological material without proper permits run the risk of being accused of “biopiracy,” which is a serious offense in Brazil. If you have specific queries, you should contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate.

### **Credit/Debit Cards**

Credit cards are widely accepted in Brazil. Some (but not all) banks in Brazil accept international debit cards. Brazil is designated as a high risk location for fraud by some Irish banks and making a transaction can often block your Irish account. Check with your bank as to whether you can use debit and credit cards in Brazil and if there is a daily withdrawal limit for debit cards.
