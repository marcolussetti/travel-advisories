## Local laws and customs

### **Illegal activity**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. Drug trafficking and use and sexual tourism are growing problems, with very severe penalties in Brazil.

### **Personal ID**

Visitors are obliged to carry an identity document while in Brazil. However, due to the difficulties in replacing lost/stolen travel documents, we recommend that instead of carrying your passport, you get a laminated copy of the picture page before travelling. Visitors can use the laminated copy for identification purposes, leaving your passport in a safe place in your hotel or lodging. You should also leave a copy of your passport (travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Property Investment in Brazil and commercial disputes**

To purchase a property in Brazil, complete all adequate due diligence procedures which may include seeking legal advice in advance on any transaction. The Embassy is aware of several cases where a property, bought in good faith, has been expropriated because of a liability acquired by the previous owner. If you require legal advice, please contact the Embassy for information on lists of English speaking lawyers in Brazil. **Please note that the Embassy of Ireland cannot give legal advice or become involved in any civil legal matters.**
