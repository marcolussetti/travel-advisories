## Local laws and customs

### **Illegal Activity**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. Drug trafficking and use and sexual tourism are growing problems, with very severe penalties in Brazil.

### **Personal ID**

Visitors are obliged to carry an identity document while in Brazil. However, due to the difficulties in replacing lost/stolen travel documents, we recommend that instead of carrying your passport, you get a laminated copy of the picture page before travelling. Visitors can use the laminated copy for identification purposes, leaving your passport in a safe place in your hotel or lodging. You should also leave a copy of your passport (travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Property Investment in Brazil and Commercial Disputes**

To purchase a property in Brazil, complete all adequate due diligence procedures which may include seeking legal advice in advance on any transaction. The Embassy is aware of several cases where a property, bought in good faith, has been expropriated because of a liability acquired by the previous owner. If you require legal advice, please contact the Embassy for information on lists of English speaking lawyers in Brazil. **Please note that the Embassy of Ireland cannot give legal advice or become involved in any civil legal matters.**

### **Brazilian Telephones**

If visitors have to use a Brazilian telephone (rather than an Irish mobile) they need to use a carrier, that is, to add an additional two numbers which effectively select through which company the call will be routed.

Thus if, from, say, Rio de Janeiro, you wished to call the Embassy, dial 0+carrier (which can be 21, 14 or 15) followed by 11.3149-7629.

Visitors should contact your Irish mobile phone provider, in advance of their trip, to confirm whether they will be able to receive/make telephone calls or text messages while travelling in Brazil.

### **Credit/Debit Cards**

Credit cards are widely accepted in Brazil. Some (but not all) banks in Brazil accept international debit cards. Brazil is designated as a high risk location for fraud by some Irish banks and making a transaction can often block your Irish account. Check with your bank as to whether you can use debit and credit cards in Brazil and if there is a daily withdrawal limit for debit cards.
