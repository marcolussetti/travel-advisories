#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Brasília , or nearest Consulate, for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

#### **Methanol poisoning**

There have been recent cases of death and severe illness in Brazil from alcoholic drinks laced with methanol. Be vigilant when buying spirit-based drinks, particularly whiskey, gin, or vodka. If you feel ill within 12 – 24 hours of consuming an alcoholic drink, seek medical assistance.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to visit Brazil as a tourist for periods of up to 90 days. Passports should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil. More information can be found in the Entry Requirements tab. If you are a single parent/guardian travelling with a minor, please consult the Entry Requirements tab for important information.

Although most visits to Brazil are trouble free, crime levels are high and visitors should be vigilant and exercise a high degree of caution at all times, and particularly during large festivals such as Carnival and New Year.

Public protests are regularly held in Brazil in response to political developments. These may cause severe disruption to roads and public transport. Non-Brazilian citizens are restricted from participating in protests in Brazil and Irish citizens should avoid all areas where protests are expected to take place, monitor local media and follow the advice from the local authorities.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy in Brasília and Consulate General in São Paulo on social media X [**@Irlandanobrasil**](https://x.com/irlandanobrasil)**;** Facebook [**@IrlnoBrasil**](https://www.facebook.com/irlnobrasil/); and Instagram [**@IrlnoBrasil**](http://www.instagram.com/irlnobrasil) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
