### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for your destination in Brazil are required. In general, visitors should protect themselves from mosquito bites in Brazil as they can carry a range of diseases including malaria, dengue fever and ZIKA virus.

### **How to Protect Yourself from Mosquitoes**

Find out from local people when local mosquitoes are most likely to be biting.

Avoid areas where mosquitoes are likely to congregate (i.e. stagnant water).

Wear appropriate clothing: long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, boots and socks.

Protect your room: The likelihood of mosquito bites can be reduced by air conditioning, insect-proof screens etc.

Protect your bed: Bed nets and cot nets should be used if rooms are not adequately screened or air conditioned.

Use insect repellents: The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises the use of DEET as a mosquito repellent (including by pregnant women – the risk to an unborn baby, certainly from malaria, would outweigh any potential risk from DEET), if you ensure to (A) use it sparingly, and (B) wash it off when away from risk of biting mosquitoes, as it is a chemical applied to the skin.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a risk in some northern parts of Brazil including much of the Amazon. You may need to take anti-malarial medication, depending on the areas to be visited, and to cover up and use insect repellent in the evening and at night.

### **Dengue Fever**

The main risk season for dengue fever is from January to March. There is no effective treatment for this fever, which has severe flu-like symptoms and can sometimes be fatal to the elderly, the very young or people with underlying conditions. As well as getting medical advice before travelling, you should also take advice on local conditions when travelling within Brazil and minimise exposure to mosquito bites by covering up and using insect repellents on exposed skin.

### **Yellow Fever**

Mosquitoes that transmit yellow fever virus can be found throughout the Amazon Basin and in forested regions along all major river basins in Brazil, including Iguaçu Falls and as far south as Rio Grande do Sul. In the recent past, outbreaks have also occurred in areas with historically low risk for transmission, including Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Vaccinations against yellow fever are available and Irish citizens are advised to follow guidance of their doctors and on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](http://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/yellowfever/factsheet/) (HPSC). It is important to note that vaccinations against yellow fever generally take 10 days to take effect. Those who have been in certain countries up to three months before travelling to Brazil should present international certificates of vaccination against yellow fever.

If you intend to travel onward from Brazil to another country, please note that certain countries may require travellers from Brazil to show proof of yellow fever vaccination.

### **Oropouche Virus Disease**

Oropouche virus disease spreads via midges and mosquitoes. In 2024, outbreaks were reported in Brazil, with most (though not all) occurring in the Amazon region. The impact of infection for pregnant women could be higher than for the general population, although this is still under investigation. Travellers are advised to follow the personal protective measures set out above.

### **‘Faith Healer’**

The Embassy is aware of a number of cases of Irish people travelling to see and be treated for illness by a well-known 'faith healer' in the state of Goias in central Brazil. Some became ill following this treatment and were in need of medical attention. The Embassy strongly cautions that serious consideration be given before embarking on such a trip or allowing any, other than a medical professional, to perform a medical procedure. The public healthcare system in Brazil, especially in the more remote areas, is not of the highest quality.
