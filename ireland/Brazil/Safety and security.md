## Safety and security

### **Driving**

Brazil has the 5th highest rate of traffic mortality in the world and 40,000 people die annually on the country's roads. If driving in Brazil be prepared to stop unexpectedly, beware of slow moving vehicles, of vehicles changing lanes without indicating; of vehicles going through red lights, especially at night, and of people/animals on the road. Pedestrians should not presume cars will stop at pedestrian crossings.

Special care should also be taken when using GPS navigation in all Brazilian towns and cities, particularly in Rio de Janeiro. There have been cases of tourists being shot after accidentally entering a favela. Avoid entering unpaved, cobbled or narrow streets which may lead into a favela. Check with your hotel or the local authorities if unsure.

If visitors want to drive:

* An Irish driving licence is not legally acceptable in Brazil – make sure to bring an international driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and, if caught, you risk being imprisoned or fined. Note that Brazil has a zero tolerance drinking and driving law.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* If visitors find themselves in a car accident, the emergency number for the fire department/ambulance is 193 and 190 for the police.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, do not hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and get the agent to explain the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Other travel**

For long distance bus travel, use a reputable company. If in any doubt or in any way unsure about the safety or security, don't board. The same is true for any road travel, including taxis and taxi drivers. Strikes affecting transport and security may take place at short notice across Brazil. These are often short but may cause disruption. We suggest visitors monitor local media for updates and advice.

### **Crime**

* Visitors are obliged to carry an identity document while in Brazil. However, as mentioned above, we recommend that instead of carrying your passport, you get a laminated copy of the picture page before travelling and use that for identification purposes, leaving your passport in a safe place in your hotel or lodging. You should also leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Be aware that tourists are often targeted by criminals, especially prior to and during public festivals such as Carnival. Petty theft, such as pick-pocketing and bag snatching, is common, including by young men on motorcycles. Thieves operate in outdoor markets, in hotels and on and around public transport. Crime levels in shanty towns or 'favelas' (see below) and many satellite cities are very high. Tourists should avoid these areas, especially at night.
* Use of sedatives to drug and rob individuals is widespread. Victims may be randomly targeted in bars, or foreigners in particular can be targeted through online dating applications. Travellers are advised to follow precautions when using dating applications or when meeting with strangers.
* Robbery and assault can also occur on Brazilian beaches. It is common for locals, for example, to take a minimal number of personal belongings to the beach and they leave passports, wallets and other valuables at home – visitors should do the same. Isolated areas on the beach should be avoided, particularly in the early evening. Sexual assaults have been reported in coastal tourist areas.
* Express kidnappings (called 'quick-nappings') and car-jackings, where individuals are abducted for short periods for a quick payoff from the victim's family, business or ATM cards are a threat. Park in well-lit areas; approach your car with the keys ready; drive with the doors locked and the windows up.
* If a victim of crime, visitors should cooperate and not resist. Be ready to hand over valuables if threatened; do not attempt to resist attackers, they may be armed or under the influence of drugs
* If a victim of a crime while in Brazil, make a report immediately to the local police. We advise visitors to obtain a "boletim de ocorrência" (police report) at a "delegacia" (police precinct) if any of your possessions are lost or stolen. You will require a stamped police report to lodge a travel insurance claim related to lost or stolen possessions. Please contact the Irish Embassy or the Irish Consulate General in São Paulo if help is needed.

### **Favelas**

Favelas (heavily populated shanty towns) exist in all major Brazilian cities; they are characterised by poverty and also often have high levels of (mainly drug-related) violent crime.

Visitors should not venture into a favela and under no circumstances accept an offer from a taxi driver to give you a tour of one. There are some respected guided tours of certain favelas in Rio de Janeiro. However, given the intensified military presence and the increase in violent crime, it is not recommended to take one at this time.

Armed clashes and shootouts between police forces and gangs frequently take place in favelas and occasionally spill over into nearby areas or onto major thoroughfares, including Linha Vermelha or the Red Line. This is the main highway to and from the international airport in Rio de Janeiro which runs alongside a large favela.
