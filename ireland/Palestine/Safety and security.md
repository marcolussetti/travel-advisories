## Safety and security

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against travel to Palestine (with the exception of East Jerusalem). The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens already present in the country.

Please note that local laws apply to visitors and it is the traveller’s responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

If already in Palestine, you should keep up to date with local media on developments that that may impact security considerations and make your travel plans accordingly.

In the event of mortar or rocket fire, a localised “red alert” siren may be activated. In such instances, please seek shelter immediately. We advise sheltering in place for a minimum of 10 minutes after the siren ends to avoid any falling shrapnel. Several mobile applications, including Home Front Command and Red Alert: Israel, are available to download free of charge, and provide real-time security and safety alerts.

### **West Bank**

There are frequent Israeli security operations throughout the West Bank. Incursions occur most frequently in Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Tulkarem and Qalqiliya. Security operations can include the use of live ammunition and tear gas. There is risk of injury to bystanders during these operations.

Extremist Israeli settler violence occurs frequently across the West Bank. Civilians, NGO personnel, journalists and international volunteers have been threatened or attacked and have been detained by the authorities. The risk of violent attacks by armed settlers is heightened during the olive harvest (October-November). This year has already seen unprecedented levels of incidents against Palestinian farmers and foreign solidarity activists.

#### Checkpoints

There are multiple Israeli military checkpoints throughout the West Bank, including “flying” or mobile checkpoints. Officers may ask to see your identification documents and personal electronic devices may be searched. There is no guarantee that you will be permitted to pass through security checkpoints even if you have a valid visa and authorisation to enter.

During religious holidays, checkpoint and border-crossing hours of operation are subject to change. Authorities may close or restrict access to checkpoints without notice.

Avoid taking photographs of military or police personnel or installations.

### **Gaza**

The security situation is extremely dangerous in Gaza. Military operations in Gaza pose a serious risk to civilians, even when taking shelter.

### **Jerusalem**

Citizens should be aware of the risk of confrontations and clashes in Jerusalem, including in parts of East Jerusalem and the Old City. Security incidents are possible during periods with movement restrictions, including religious holidays. These include a risk of clashes near the Al-Aqsa Compound on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, in particular during Ramadan.

### **Illegal Settlements**

Citizens should be also aware that the Irish Government, together with the majority of the international community, considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank to be illegal under international law. We therefore strongly advise against the purchase of property in such settlements.

### **Driving**

Road users are advised to exercise caution. Driving is sometimes erratic and there are frequent accidents.

Expect multiple roadblocks and checkpoints. Be prepared to present your identification documents and follow the instructions of police or military officers. Do not pass through checkpoints without stopping, even if they appear unattended.

Bring an international driving licence and have adequate and appropriate insurance.

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited.

Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent theft.

### **Vehicle Hire**

If planning to drive from Israel to the West Bank, please note that not all car hire companies or insurance companies cover travel into the West Bank.

Check that travellers have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
