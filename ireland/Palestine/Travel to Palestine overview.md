### Travel to Palestine

All entry and exit to Palestine is controlled by Israel. [**Here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/israel/) is our travel advice page for travel to Israel.

Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV) is presently operational. Please contact your airline for relevant updates prior to travel. The three land border crossings from Jordan (Allenby/King Hussein Bridge, Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein Crossing and Yitzhak Rabin/Arava Crossing) may be affected by long delays, reduced hours, and unforeseen closures without prior notification.

### **Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL):**

From 1 January 2025 citizens of all ages from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) seeking to enter Israel or pass through Israeli-controlled crossings to Palestine must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL) on arrival. For further guidance, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

The ETA-IL costs 25 NIS. Approval will allow multiple entries and is valid for up to two years. Please note that obtaining a new passport, changing name, gender or country of citizenship will require new travel authorisation.

Please be aware that approval may be revoked by the Israeli authorities on security grounds and that Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott.
