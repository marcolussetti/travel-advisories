## Travel to Palestine overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel, with the exception of East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah, where we advise Avoid Non-Essential Travel.

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to the Gaza Strip, and to all border areas between the Gaza Strip and Israel.**

We advise against travel to the West Bank, with the exception of East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah, where we advise against non-essential travel. Israeli security operations continue across the West Bank, along with a high incidence of settler violence, in particular during the olive harvest season in October and November. We strongly advise against all travel to the northern governorates of the West Bank; Jenin, Tulkarem and Tubas.

The security situation remains tense and unpredictable, with the potential for intense escalation. Please continue to exercise caution, monitor local media regularly, follow the advice of local authorities, and observe any additional security measures imposed.

Irish citizens currently in Palestine who have not already done so, are asked to register on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/).

### Travel to Palestine

All entry and exit to Palestine is controlled by Israel. [**Here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/israel/) is our travel advice page for travel to Israel.

Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV) is presently operational. Please contact your airline for relevant updates prior to travel. The three land border crossings from Jordan (Allenby/King Hussein Bridge, Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein Crossing and Yitzhak Rabin/Arava Crossing) may be affected by long delays, reduced hours, and unforeseen closures without prior notification.

### **Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL):**

From 1 January 2025 citizens of all ages from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) seeking to enter Israel or pass through Israeli-controlled crossings to Palestine must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL) on arrival. For further guidance, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

The ETA-IL costs 25 NIS. Approval will allow multiple entries and is valid for up to two years. Please note that obtaining a new passport, changing name, gender or country of citizenship will require new travel authorisation.

Please be aware that approval may be revoked by the Israeli authorities on security grounds and that Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott.
