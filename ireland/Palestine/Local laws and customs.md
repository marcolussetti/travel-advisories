## Local laws and customs

Palestine is a predominantly Muslim society. To respect local traditions and customs, conservative dress is advised (women’s clothes should cover their legs and upper arms). During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset are forbidden for Muslims over the age of eight. While alcohol is available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, visitors should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places during Ramadan – the dates of which vary each year.

Dress modestly at pilgrimage sites and in religious areas.

All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention in socially and religiously conservative areas of Palestine.

### **LGBT+ Travellers**

Homosexuality remains largely taboo in Palestinian society. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use and/or trafficking carries stiff penalties, including fines and prison terms.

### **Personal Identification**

Identification should be carried at all times in case requested by the local authorities. It is also advisable to make photocopies of your passport in case of theft or loss.
