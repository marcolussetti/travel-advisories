## Health

### Extreme Heat

Extreme temperatures are currently affecting many areas of Italy. For information on hottest areas and how to take care in the heat visit the HSE website [**advice on heat health**](https://www.hpsc.ie/news/title-24427-en.html) or the website of the [**Italian Ministry of Health**](https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/caldo/homeCaldo.jsp) (in Italian only).

High temperatures can be dangerous. Know the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke. If you are in Italy

* stay indoors or in the shade during midday hours
* stay hydrated
* carry a sufficient water supply
* monitor local media for information on heat warnings

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. An appropriate travel insurance policy should cover these costs provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

Emergency expenses

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you are sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

Irish Citizens are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay there. Ensure that you get or renew your EHIC (the new name for the E111) before you go, and remember, you need one for every person travelling in your group.

[**Apply for your EHIC and find out more information**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so check with the hospital administrator beforehand.

### **Vaccinations**

Irish citizens will not need any vaccinations for Italy. If you fall ill whilst in Italy and require further advice on how to access healthcare, please contact the Embassy.
