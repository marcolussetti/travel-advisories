### **Extreme Heat and Weather Warnings in Italy**

Extreme levels of heat, reaching or exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, are forecast for parts of Italy in the coming weeks. Such extreme temperatures can occur in all parts of Italy during the summer months and it is strongly advised to take precautions both outdoors and indoors. Extreme temperatures are dangerous for all, but pose particular risks to young children, the elderly and people with underlying health conditions.

Temperatures and weather conditions can change quickly in Italy and you should be prepared to face excessive heat. When travelling in Italy this summer, you should ensure that you always have water available and drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, even while inside. Where possible, you should avoid being outdoors during the hottest time of the day (11am to 3pm). While outdoors, wear a hat and light clothing that covers your skin and regularly apply sunscreen of factor 30+ for adults and factor 50+ for children and those with pale skin. You should be particularly aware that extreme heat can make outdoor activities such as hiking or playing sports significantly strenuous even for experienced and physically fit individuals.

For more details on staying safe in hot weather, including advice on when to seek medical attention, please consult the [**HSE’s information page on this subject**](https://healthservice.hse.ie/staff/procedures-guidelines/staying-safe-in-hot-weather/).

Spontaneous fires and wildfires are also possible under these conditions. You should stay informed of local news and instructions from local authorities while travelling in Italy. Weather and personal safety alerts are typically published in English on [**Italy’s Civil Protection Department website**](https://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/en/).

### **Jubilee Year in Rome**

From 24 December 2024 to 6 January 2026, the Jubilee 2025, also known as the Holy Year, will take place in Rome. The city is expected to see significantly elevated tourist levels, particularly during the larger events such as Easter and the Jubilee of Youth on 28 July–3 August. When travelling in the city during this time, you should expect large crowds and gatherings and disruptions to travel and movement. When planning travel in Rome during the Jubilee Year, it may be useful to consult the [**Jubilee 2025 official site**](https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en.html)**.**

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Italy.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Italy. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the local municipality as a resident.

Visitors to Italy are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbRome**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbRome?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrlEmbRome/)) to ensure access to any relevant updates and alerts.

Individuals in Italy are required by law to have government ID in their possession at all times. This may be required including when checking into hotels or private accommodation, as well as for entry to sports and other entertainment events. The Embassy recommends that you keep your passport in a safe place, and carry another form of ID, or a photocopy of your passport while moving around Italy.

Irish citizens should be aware that while crime levels in Italy are generally low, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching, in city centres, on public transport and at major tourist attractions. To reduce your risk, ensure that you always keep sight of your personal belongings and avoid carrying valuables together in bags or pockets. You should leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place such as a hotel safe.
