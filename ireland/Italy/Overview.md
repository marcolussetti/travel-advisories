### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Italy.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Italy. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the local municipality as a resident.

Visitors to Italy are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbRome**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbRome?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrlEmbRome/)) to ensure access to any relevant updates and alerts.

Individuals in Italy are required by law to have government ID in their possession at all times. This may be required including when checking into hotels or private accommodation, as well as for entry to sports and other entertainment events. The Embassy recommends that you keep your passport in a safe place, and carry another form of ID, or a photocopy of your passport while moving around Italy.

Irish citizens should be aware that while crime levels in Italy are generally low, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching, in city centres, on public transport and at major tourist attractions. To reduce your risk, ensure that you always keep sight of your personal belongings and avoid carrying valuables together in bags or pockets. You should leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place such as a hotel safe.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.
