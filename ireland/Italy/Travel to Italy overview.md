#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Rome for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

There is no change to entry requirements for Italian passport holders travelling directly to Ireland without transiting through the UK.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Italy.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Italy. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the local municipality as a resident.

Visitors to Italy are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbRome**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbRome?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrlEmbRome/)) to ensure access to any relevant updates and alerts.

Individuals in Italy are required by law to have government ID in their possession at all times. This may be required including when checking into hotels or private accommodation, as well as for entry to sports and other entertainment events. The Embassy recommends that you keep your passport in a safe place, and carry another form of ID, or a photocopy of your passport while moving around Italy.

Irish citizens should be aware that while crime levels in Italy are generally low, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching, in city centres, on public transport and at major tourist attractions. To reduce your risk, ensure that you always keep sight of your personal belongings and avoid carrying valuables together in bags or pockets. You should leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place such as a hotel safe.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Italy by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 113
* Fire brigade: 115
* Ambulance: 118
