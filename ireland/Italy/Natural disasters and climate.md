## Natural disasters and climate

### **Skiing**

If visiting a ski resort take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations.

### **Earthquakes**

Many parts of Italy lie on a major seismic fault line. Minor tremors and earthquakes are a frequent occurrence, particularly in the central regions of Italy. Information about crisis preparedness and on-going crises affecting parts of Italy can be found on the Italian Civil Protection Department website - [**Civil Protection Department**](https://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/en/%23).

### **Flooding**

Visitors to Venice should note that parts of Venice are liable to flooding at certain times of year, especially in late autumn and early spring.

### **Volcanoes**

Italy also has several active volcanoes, including Stromboli and Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Those travelling should be aware of possible travel disruption in the event of volcanic activity, including airport closures and are advised to check the latest alerts and weather forecast for those areas.
