## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Visitors to Italy should be aware that alcoholic spirits are usually sold in significantly larger measures in bars and restaurants than in Ireland.

Whilst Italians will normally drink wine with their meals, there’s a cultural taboo and intolerance regarding public intoxication and in particular anti-social behaviour as a result of excessive alcohol consumption.

### **Public Conduct**

In cities such as Florence and Venice, observe notices regarding public conduct. In certain areas, near churches and in some piazzas, eating and sitting on steps or monuments is forbidden. Churches and other places of worship, including St Peters’ Basilica, require visitors to dress modestly.

Tourists should be aware that bathing in fountains is prohibited at all times.

### **Getting married in Italy**

All Irish citizens wishing to marry in Italy must obtain a nulla osta (a certificate of freedom to marry). More information on how to apply is available on our website in the Travel section.
