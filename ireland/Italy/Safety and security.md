## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

The political situation in Italy is stable but public demonstrations can occur frequently, especially in the centres of major cities where tourists are likely to find themselves. They are usually well organised and rarely, if ever, turn violent. However, you should avoid them and exercise common sense if in the vicinity of large public gatherings.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Italy is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. Currently the Italian Government has assessed the level of the threat of a terrorist attack in Italy as “medium/high” (level 2). Visitors to Italy, especially in the larger cities such as Rome and Milan, may see an increased police presence and security checks. This should not impact tourists particularly but exercise ordinary caution and follow the security advice of the local authorities.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Italy but take sensible precautions:

* Incidents of tourists’ vehicles being broken into and the vehicle’s contents being stolen have increased in recent months. Irish citizens are advised not to leave any valuables, including their passports, in vehicles that are unattended.
* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Be aware that petty crime (pick pocketing, bag snatching etc.) is common, particularly on public transport and in tourist areas. Vigilance should be paid to personal belongings in train stations (particularly Termini Station in Rome), in the public areas of the airports, at all tourist sites and when using bus, metro or tram services, including when unloading baggage from coaches travelling to and from the airports.
* We have been made aware of an increasing number of incidents recently where travellers have been drugged through substances being placed in drinks, and subsequently robbed of money, credit cards and mobile telephones. We recommend visitors exercise vigilance in bars, and be wary of drinks offered by strangers in night spots and areas where tourists congregate in the evenings.

### **Skiing**

If visiting a ski resort take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations.

### Natural Disasters

### **Earthquakes**

Many parts of Italy lie on a major seismic fault line. Minor tremors and earthquakes are a frequent occurrence, particularly in the central regions of Italy. Information about crisis preparedness and on-going crises affecting parts of Italy can be found on the Italian Civil Protection Department website - [Civil Protection Department](https://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/en/%23).

### **Flooding**

Visitors to Venice should note that parts of Venice are liable to flooding at certain times of year, especially in late autumn and early spring.

### **Volcanoes**

Italy also has several active volcanoes, including Stromboli and Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Those travelling should be aware of possible travel disruption in the event of volcanic activity, including airport closures and are advised to check the latest alerts and weather forecast for those areas.
