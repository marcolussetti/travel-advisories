## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

The British authorities currently place the terrorist threat level for Great Britain at "substantial", the third highest alert level, which means an attack remains likely. There is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates. Additional security measures are in place at airports, throughout transportation networks and at high profiles venues in Great Britain. Travellers may experience delays.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Great Britain but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Great Britain, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy in London or the Irish Consulate in Edinburgh if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Great Britain, remember although the regulations are very similar to Ireland, you should always exercise caution.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.

### **Vehicle Hire**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
