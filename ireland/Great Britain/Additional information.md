## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

The Common Travel Area (CTA) in existence between Ireland and the UK (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) enables British and Irish citizens to move freely within the CTA. The UK Government may require proof of citizenship so Irish citizens are advised to carry an acceptable form of identification document that shows their citizenship when travelling to Britain.

The UK Government advises that this could include:

-your valid passport or passport card

-a copy of your passport or passport card with your identity and nationality clearly visible

-an expired passport or passport card, which Border Force are satisfied was issued to you originally

-evidence of having obtained Irish (or British) citizenship

However, this list will not be treated as exhaustive.Â Other documents, including providing more than one document, may be accepted. These will be considered on a case by case basis by the UK Border Force.

Please note, however, that some airlines and other carriers require that you have a valid passport before you can travel with them. Please check with your travel company regarding their requirements before travelling.
