### **Travel Insurance**

We can’t pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you haven’t broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

Ireland and the UK are part of the Common Travel Area and under the CTA Irish and UK residents can move freely between the two countries to live and work and have access to public services - including healthcare. Healthcare cover is provided under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which provides a framework for continued access to healthcare for people on a temporary visit to the UK.

Irish residents can demonstrate their eligibility to access necessary healthcare while on a temporary stay in the UK by presenting their [**European Health Insurance Card**](https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/ehic/). In the absence of an EHIC any of the following documentation will be accepted as proof of eligibility for healthcare:

* an Irish photocard driving licence
* an Irish Residence Permit
* an Irish medical or GP visit card
* any two documents showing a person’s Irish address issued in the last 6 months and alongside photo ID.

In each case above the document presented must be current and in date. Where the document does not incorporate a photo, additional photo ID may be requested by the healthcare provider.

Furthermore, it is recommended that you also obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs which are not covered under the TCA. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Medical Treatment**

Visitors requiring immediate treatment for serious injuries/illness should call 999 or go to the nearest hospital with an Accident and Emergency department (A&E).
