## Travel to Bhutan overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **General Travel Advice**

Bhutan’s tourism industry is small and strictly regulated.

Irish citizens [**require a visa**](https://bhutan.travel/visa) to enter Bhutan and the visa must be applied for and approved in advance of travel. A daily Sustainable Development Fee (SDF) is also payable by tourists. For the latest information on the visa process, application fees and the SDF, please consult the [**Bhutan Ministry of Tourism Website**](https://bhutan.travel/).

Business or other non-tourist visitors to Bhutan must arrange a visa through their sponsoring organisations.

It is mandatory to be accompanied by a guide for any journey or any trek beyond Thimphu and Paro. Guides are also mandatory for visitors who enter Bhutan via its land borders and plan to travel beyond the border towns. Visitors no longer require a permit to travel around the country, as long as they are accompanied by a guide certified by the Department of Tourism. Please note that the Department of Tourism has an approved list of tourism services and accommodation providers in Bhutan, which visitors must adhere to.

All visitors must have full, valid travel insurance for the duration of their visit.

Visitors can find more information (in English) on [**entry requirements from the Bhutanese Ministry of Tourism**](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/).
