## Embassy contact

There is no Irish Embassy in Ecuador. However, if assistance is needed, please contact the Irish Embassy in Chile.

The Embassy operates an out of hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance outside of hours, on weekends and on public holidays. If in need of emergency assistance during these times, visitors should leave a message on the emergency message system by calling +56 2 3304 6600. The emergency message system is checked regularly outside of office hours and a member of the Embassy staff will make contact as soon as possible.  
When leaving a message, remember to state your name, the nature of the problem, where you are, and the details of how the Duty Officer can contact you (e.g. leave your mobile phone number, or the phone number of the hotel/hostel where you are staying).

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.
