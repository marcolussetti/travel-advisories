The current security situation remains volatile and uncertain due to the threat of violent crime. Travellers should carry their IDs at all times and follow the instructions of local authorities. There may be increased military and police presence around key public buildings, airports, and on the streets.

The Embassy advises all Irish citizens in Ecuador to be particularly attentive to news and safety recommendations from the Ecuadorian authorities. If an Irish citizen decides to travel to Ecuador at this time, via a land border from Peru or Colombia, against our clear advice, they must present a criminal record certificate from their country of residence covering the last five years. The certificate must be legalised with a Hague Apostille. This does not apply to children and adolescents under 18.

If they do not have the correct documentation they may not be permitted to enter via the land border, and they may have to change travel plans. This restriction applies exclusively to land borders, and not to entry via airports or seaports.

For all entry, including via land, airports and seaports, you may be asked to provide a reason for your travel and evidence of a return or onward journey.
