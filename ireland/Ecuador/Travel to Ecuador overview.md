## Travel to Ecuador overview

### **Security Status**

Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

Owing to drug trafficking, criminal activity, and high risk of violence, the Embassy advises to **avoid all but essential travel to**:

- Within 20km of the border with Colombia, except for the official border-crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province. In particular, avoid travel to Carchi and Sucumbíos;

The Embassy advises all Irish citizens in Ecuador to be particularly attentive to news and safety recommendations from the Ecuadorian authorities.

If an Irish citizen decides to travel to Ecuador at this time, via a land border from Peru or Colombia, **against our clear advice**, they must present a criminal record certificate from their country of residence covering the last five years. The certificate must be legalised with a Hague Apostille. This does not apply to children and adolescents under 18.

If they do not have the correct documentation they **may not be permitted** to enter via the land border, and they may have to change travel plans. This restriction applies exclusively to land borders, and not to entry via airports or seaports.

For all entry, including via land, airports and seaports, you may be asked to provide a reason for your travel and evidence of a return or onward journey.

Irish citizens **do not require** a visa to enter Ecuador for stays up to **90 days**.

A valid passport is required for travel to Ecuador. Irish passports should have a **minimum validity** of 6 months. Passport cards **cannot be used**.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the **Entry Requirements tab**.
