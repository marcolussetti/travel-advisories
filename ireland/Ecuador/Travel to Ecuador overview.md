## Travel to Ecuador overview

### **Security Status**

Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

The security status of ‘Avoid Non-Essential Travel’ currently applies to all of mainland Ecuador owing to civil unrest, violent crime, and kidnapping.

Ecuador is in a state of **“internal armed conflict”**. There is an increased presence of security forces to contain gang violence across the country, including in Guayaquil and Quito.

Owing to civil unrest, violent crime, and kidnapping, the security status of ‘**Avoid Non-Essential Travel’** **currently applies to most of Ecuador, with the following exceptions:**

* **The Galápagos Islands,** where the Embassy advises citizens to **take normal precautions.** This also applies to citizens transiting through the airports of Quito or Guayaquil for onward travel to the Galapagos Islands;
* **Quito and surround Pichincha province,** where we advise citizens to **exercise a high degree of caution.**

**Owing to significant criminal activity drug trafficking, and high risk of violence, the Embassy advises to avoid all travel to:**

* Within 20km of the **border with Colombia**, except for the official border-crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province. In particular, avoid travel to Carchi and Sucumbíos;
* **Minefields** near the southern portion of the border with Peru, in particular Chinchipe, El Pangui, Nangaritza, and Yantzaza;
* **Esmeraldas**, **El Oro**, **Guayas**, and **Los Ríos** provinces.

### **Yellow Fever**

Travellers to Ecuador arriving from Brazil, Uganda, or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or who have transited through airports in these countries, require a **yellow fever vaccination certificate**.

The yellow fever vaccine must have been administered at least 10 days before entering Ecuador. The certificate may be requested when boarding by means of air, land, or sea transport to Ecuador.

### **State of Emergency**

A state of emergency was renewed on 31 December 2025 for 60 days owing to ongoing internal unrest and armed violence. The current state of emergency applies to the following provinces:

* Guayas
* El Oro
* Manabí
* Los Ríos
* Santa Elena
* Pichincha
* Santo Domingo
* Esmeraldas
* Sucumbíos
* Echeandía and Las Naves in the province of Bolívar
* Cotopaxi in the province of La Maná

The state of emergency allows the military and police to:

* seize assets
* conduct inspections;
* prohibit assembly;
* read private mail and phone records;
* enter private properties without permission.

To note, in some areas, a curfew from 10:00 to 05:00 may apply. Should you need to travel to or from the airport during curfew hours, this is permissible by presenting evidence of a flight booking reservation.

The Embassy advises all Irish citizens in Ecuador to be particularly attentive to news and safety recommendations from the Ecuadorian authorities.

If an Irish citizen decides to travel to Ecuador at this time, via a land border from Peru or Colombia, **contrary to this travel advice**, they must present a criminal record certificate from their country of residence covering the last five years. The certificate must be legalised with a Hague Apostille. This does not apply to children and adolescents under 18.

If they do not have the correct documentation they **may not be permitted** to enter via the land border, and they may have to change travel plans. This restriction applies **exclusively to land borders**, and not to entry via airports or seaports.

For all entry, including via land, airports and seaports, you may be asked to provide a reason for your travel and evidence of a return or onward journey.

Irish citizens **do not require** a visa to enter Ecuador for stays up to **90 days**.

A valid passport is required for travel to Ecuador. Irish passports should have a **minimum validity** of 6 months. Passport cards **cannot be used**.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the **Entry Requirements tab**.
