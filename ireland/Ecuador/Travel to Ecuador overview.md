## Travel to Ecuador overview

### **Security Status**

Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

The security status of ‘Avoid Non-Essential Travel’ currently applies to all of mainland Ecuador owing to civil unrest, violent crime, and kidnapping.

The Embassy advises citizens to take normal precautions when travelling in the Galapagos Islands, off the coast of mainland Ecuador. Transit in the airports of Quito or Guayaquil for onward travel to the Galapagos Islands is considered safe.

Owing to pretty significant criminal activity drug trafficking, and high risk of violence, the Embassy advises to **avoid all travel to**:

- Within 20km of the border with Colombia, except for the official border-crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province. In particular, avoid travel to Carchi and Sucumbíos;

- Minefields near the southern portion of the border with Peru, in particular Chinchipe, El Pangui, Nangaritza, and Yantzaza;

- Esmeraldas, El Oro, Guayas, and Los Ríos provinces.

This **does not apply** to airside transit within Guayaquil Airport in Guayas Province, including onward or return travel to the **Galapagos Islands.**

**To note, your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.**

### **Yellow Fever**

As of 12 May 2025, travellers to Ecuador will require a yellow fever vaccination certificate, owing to the increase of yellow fever in the region. In particular, travellers from Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil will need to present a yellow fever vaccination certificate.

The yellow fever vaccine must have been administered at least 10 days before entering Ecuador. The certificate may be requested when boarding by means of air, land, or sea transport to Ecuador.

### **State of Emergency**

-Guayas

-El Oro

-Manabí

- Cotopaxi in the province of La Maná

The state of emergency allows the military and police to:

- read private mail and phone records;

- enter private properties without permission.

### **Curfew**

Curfew hours (10pm until 05am) apply, until further notice, for the following provinces:

- Bolívar;

- Carchi;

- Chimborazo;

- Cotopaxi;

- Imbarbura.

Should you need to travel to or from the airport during curfew hours, this is permissible by presenting evidence of a flight booking reservation.

The Embassy advises all Irish citizens in Ecuador to be particularly attentive to news and safety recommendations from the Ecuadorian authorities.

If an Irish citizen decides to travel to Ecuador at this time, via a land border from Peru or Colombia, **against our clear advice**, they must present a criminal record certificate from their country of residence covering the last five years. The certificate must be legalised with a Hague Apostille. This does not apply to children and adolescents under 18.

If they do not have the correct documentation they **may not be permitted** to enter via the land border, and they may have to change travel plans. This restriction applies exclusively to land borders, and not to entry via airports or seaports.

For all entry, including via land, airports and seaports, you may be asked to provide a reason for your travel and evidence of a return or onward journey.

Irish citizens **do not require** a visa to enter Ecuador for stays up to **90 days**.

A valid passport is required for travel to Ecuador. Irish passports should have a **minimum validity** of 6 months. Passport cards **cannot be used**.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the **Entry Requirements tab**.
