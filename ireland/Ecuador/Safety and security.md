## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime can be an issue in Ecuador and visitors should take sensible precautions.

There is a continuing risk of violent crimes against foreign nationals with reports of European nationals being attacked, robbed and sexually assaulted. The area of La Mariscal, popular with tourists, can be particularly dangerous.

Visitors should remain extremely vigilant and cautious about your surroundings whilst travelling around Ecuador, especially on arrival in the country.

Crime by unregistered taxi drivers is also on the rise. If visitors require a taxi, please ensure that you only hail an authorised radio taxi (yellow cab); these taxis display their taxi registration sticker on the windscreen and doors and have licence plates.

Interstate travel is dangerous, with an increase in robberies at bus stations. We advise against travelling at night.

The Northern border with Colombia has a higher crime rate, including kidnappings, than the rest of the country, and we advise against all travel to this region.

### **Tours and Adventure Activities**

Transport and tour operators do not always follow recommended safety precautions and maintenance standards, including for adventure activities. Visitors are advised to exercise caution when undertaking these activities and ensure they are fully aware of the risks involved. Make sure to use a reputable operator and check that the equipment is in good condition. It is strongly recommended to have a comprehensive insurance policy.
