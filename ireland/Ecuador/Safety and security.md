## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime rates are high in Ecuador. Visitors should remain extremely vigilant and cautious about their surroundings whilst travelling around Ecuador, especially on arrival in the country.

Visitors should take sensible precautions such as:

- ensure that belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times;

- avoid travelling after dark, and in isolated areas;

- avoid showing signs of affluence;

- exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs;

- don’t resist if threatened – hand over cash and valuables immediately.

Drug trafficking, transnational organised crime, and street gang activity is prevalent.

There is a continuing risk of violent crimes against foreign nationals with reports of European nationals being attacked, robbed and sexually assaulted. The area of La Mariscal, popular with tourists, can be particularly dangerous. Tourist police officers are present in major cities, including Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca.

Interstate travel is dangerous, with an increase in robberies at bus stations.

### **Kidnapping**

The number of kidnappings, especially express kidnappings, has significantly increased since 2022. Kidnappers mainly target locals, but foreigners have also been targeted. Many victims have been rescued by the police. Some victims are released in exchange for ransom.

Express kidnappings are committed by organised gangs, sometimes in collaboration with taxi or rideshare drivers. Kidnappers may take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal, or else hold their victims for a few days and force them to make online bank transfers before releasing them.

While in Ecuador:

* choose accommodation with good security measures;
* keep doors and windows locked at all times;
* check your car for suspicious markings after leaving it parked on the street;
* avoid hailing taxis on the street;
* use only reputable taxi companies, with taxis that display their taxi registration sticker on the windscreen and doors and have licence plates;
* use the security features in rideshare apps;
* if kidnapped, comply with the kidnappers’ demands and don’t resist.

### **Tours and Adventure Activities**

Transport and tour operators do not always follow recommended safety precautions and maintenance standards, including for adventure activities. Visitors are advised to exercise caution when undertaking these activities and ensure they are fully aware of the risks involved. Make sure to use a reputable operator and check that the equipment is in good condition. It is strongly recommended to have a comprehensive insurance policy.

### **Demonstrations**

Demonstrations occur frequently. Ecuadorian law prohibits political activities by foreigners. You may face detention if you take part in demonstrations or political activities.
