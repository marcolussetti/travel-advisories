The Embassy advises all Irish citizens in Ecuador to be particularly attentive to news and safety recommendations from the Ecuadorian authorities. If an Irish citizen decides to travel to Ecuador at this time, via a land border from Peru or Colombia, against our clear advice, they must present a criminal record certificate from their country of residence covering the last five years. The certificate must be legalised with a Hague Apostille. This does not apply to children and adolescents under 18.

If they do not have the correct documentation they may not be permitted to enter via the land border, and they may have to change travel plans. This restriction applies exclusively to land borders, and not to entry via airports or seaports.

For all entry, including via land, airports and seaports, you may be asked to provide a reason for your travel and evidence of a return or onward journey.

### **General Travel Advice**

Due to a significant increase in violent criminal activity throughout the country, citizens should currently avoid non-essential travel to the following areas:

- Esmeraldas

- Manabí

- Santa Elena

- Guayas

- El Oro

- Los Ríos

- Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas

This **does not apply** to airside transit within Guayaquil Airport in Guayas province, including onward or return travel to the Galapagos Islands.

We advise against all travel within the 20km exclusion zone along the border with Colombia, except for the official border-crossing town of Tulcan in Carchi province, due to the security situation.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Ecuador for stays up to 90 days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Ecuador. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Ecuador are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
