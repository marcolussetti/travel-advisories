## Safety and security

The political situation in Thailand can be unpredictable and has led to periods of civil and political unrest.

Lèse-majesté (criticism of the monarchy in any form) is a crime in Thailand; it can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. Some foreign and Thai journalists, Human Rights Defenders and members of the public have faced criminal charges, including for defamation, sedition, and under the Computer Crimes Act for raising concerns, making political comments, and sharing articles online that could be seen as portraying Thailand negatively or making accusations about individuals.

Terrorist attacks can happen in Thailand. There were explosions in Bangkok in April and May 2017. In August 2016, there were multiple explosions in tourist areas across Thailand and in July 2015, there was a large explosion at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, which is a major tourist attraction. On 2 August 2019, there were three small explosions at locations in central Bangkok. Please follow the advice of Thai Authorities, avoid any large gatherings and be aware of your personal safety at all times.

We strongly advise against all travel to or through the southern Provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Southern Songkhla. On 10 March 2019, a number of small explosions occurred in Satun City and in Patthalung Province in the South of Thailand. In December 2018, there was a number of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City.

Most Irish tourists enjoy their visits to Thailand safely and happily. That is why many return. However, a number, including Irish citizens, are subject to theft, scams and fraud of various kinds, and a small number to assault and violence. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. Keep credit cards secure, use alcohol moderately, avoid drugs at all times, do not carry large amounts of cash, keep valuables safely at your hotel and take common sense precautions.

### **Drugs**

Punishment for drug-related offences such as possession, distribution or manufacture are severe. We cannot overemphasise our message: do not become involved in using or distributing drugs in Thailand. The consequences (as a number of Irish citizens are aware) can be severe.

Private recreational use of certain cannabis products is legal if the THC content is below 0.2% by weight. **It is illegal to use cannabis in public places.** Cultivation, consumption, distribution and sales of cannabis products is legal, although some restrictions remain in place - check with the relevant local authorities if you are unsure.

Some Irish nationals have suffered severe psychiatric effects due to cannabis use while in Thailand.

### **Southern Border Provinces**

We advise against all travel to or through the Southern Thai Provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Southern Songkhla due to ongoing instability and terrorist activity in this region. On 10 March 2019, a number of small explosions occurred in Satun City and in Patthalung Province in the South of Thailand and in December 2018; there was a number of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City.

Martial law still applies in these Provinces. There are frequent incidences of violence and there have been reports that extremists may be planning to target westerners in the southern border Provinces.

### **Cambodian Border**

There have been occasional clashes between Cambodia and Thailand over the 'Preah Vihear' issue for several years. Hostilities broke on a number of occasions in 2011 and there were civilian and military deaths on both sides. We recommend that you should take care travelling through Thailand-Cambodia border.

### **Burmese/Myanmar Border**

We recommend to exercise caution when traveling to rural areas of the Northern region and particularly near the Thai-Myanmar border. There are occasional clashes between the Thai security forces and armed drug traffickers. Military checkpoints are active and passengers are often asked to produce their ID. If considering traveling into Myanmar from Thailand, only cross into that country at an official border checkpoint and follow instructions of the Burmese/Myanmar and Thai authorities.

### **Terrorism**

Terrorist attacks may occur in Thailand. The last major terrorist incident in Bangkok was in August 2015 when 20 civilians lost their lives. There have been a number of smaller explosions since then. On 2 August 2019, there were three small explosions at locations in central Bangkok. A number of foreign tourists were also injured in a bombing in August 2016.

### **Crime**

Be aware of the risk of petty crime, including from pickpockets, bag snatchers and those organising scams targeting tourists. Always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place. Keep an eye on your credit card during transactions to prevent fraud.
* The theft of passports and credit cards is a problem in Thailand. Leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers. Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as train and bus stations. Many visitors had their mobile phones and purses snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in Tuk-Tuks. Stay vigilant!

### **Tourist Scams**

Tourist scams are, unfortunately, a fairly common occurrence in Thailand, despite the best efforts of the authorities. Using common sense and exercising caution is essential to avoiding such scams. Do not accept offers to bring you to a jewellery shop or factory for a "special promotion". Avoid all offers from strangers approaching you in the streets with offers of inexpensive gems, travel, clothing, tours etc. If you feel you have been scammed contact the Thai Tourist Police on 1155. They will be as helpful as possible. However, the best way to avoid being scammed is to avoid the scammers in the first instance.

Tourists have been scammed when hiring motorcycles and jet skis (especially on the islands) so get local advice on the reputation of any rental firm before approaching it. Avoid hiring jet skis and quad bikes. **Never hand over your passport as security when renting these vehicles**. Many Irish tourists have had their passports withheld if they cannot pay the fees associated with damage to these vehicles. Please be advised that the Embassy cannot retrieve your passport for you in such situations. Be aware also that there are enormous amounts of motorcycle accidents in Thailand. Irish citizens in the past have been injured or lost their lives. Always wear a helmet (it is illegal not to) and drive carefully. Check with your insurance if you are covered for such activities and ensure you have a valid international driver licence. Some insurance companies will not cover your costs if you were driving unlawfully i.e. with no helmet or no proper licence and medical bills can be incredibly costly.

If passing through Suvarnabhumi Airport, make sure that you have paid for, and have receipts for, all items in your possession before you move away from the vendor.

### **Property Scams**

Ownership of property in Thailand is very complicated. There have been many reported cases of property scams. Make sure to seek proper legal advice. Foreigners are not permitted to own land in Thailand. Many foreigners, including Irish citizens have found themselves in very difficult situations as a result of dealing in property. Be aware of the pitfalls. Avoid them.

### **Personal Safety**

In general, Thailand is a fairly safe country in which to travel once some basic precautions are taken. However, there have been incidents where foreign nationals have been attacked. Female passengers, in particular, should be careful of their personal safety. There have also been incidents where tourists have had their drinks drugged (tourist areas and 'red light' districts). Be very careful about taking drinks from strangers and be very wary at parties such as the Full Moon party on Koh Phangan Island. Avoid all drugs, consume alcohol in moderation and exercise caution at large social gatherings. Do not swim at night.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Thailand, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at [**Embassy in Bangkok**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/thailand/bangkok/) for information and advice (+66 (0) 2 0161360). Please note that the Embassy cannot report a crime on your behalf.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive any kind of vehicle in Thailand, be extremely careful. Road conditions are poor and Thailand has one of the highest accident rates in the world. Irish citizens have been involved in very serious accidents. Please note:

* An international or Thai driving licence is required to drive in Thailand
* Make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring any kind of vehicle, **we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security**. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Motorcycle/Scooter Hire**

We strongly recommend **not to rent a scooter or motorcycle while in Thailand**. Riding a motorcycle is very dangerous. The majority of road accidents in Thailand involve motorcycles. A number of Irish citizens have been killed or seriously injured in accidents. If you do decide to hire a scooter or motorcycle, we advise to exercise extreme caution and always wear a helmet: it is illegal not to. We have also noted a number of motorcycle and scooter hire scams whereby those hiring have left their passports for security and are then presented with a bill for damage (real or not) to the hired vehicle. **Do not hand over your passport as security for vehicle hire.** The same advice is also applicable to the hire of jet-skis. Please be advised that the Embassy cannot retrieve your passport for you in such situations.

### **Taxis**

If arriving by air, use licensed taxis from official taxi stands. Unlicensed vehicles (black and white number plates) are not properly insured to carry passengers.

### **Swimming**

Take proper care when swimming – Follow the instructions of beach lifeguards and the signage on beaches. There are many fatalities in the waters of Thailand, including Irish citizens. There have been reports of poisonous jellyfish in the waters off Koh Phangan, Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lanta and Koh Phi Phi. Please bear in mind that jellyfish can swim close to the shore and be most careful during rainy season. If stung, do not rinse the wound with fresh water instead seek immediate medical attention.
