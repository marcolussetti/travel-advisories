### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Thailand for the purpose of tourism or short-term business engagements for a period not exceeding 60 days. A valid passport is required for travel to Thailand. Thai immigration authorities are known to adopt a strict approach to accepting damaged passports. Irish citizens are advised to renew their passport before travel to Thailand should it have any damage as Thai Immigration may refuse entry otherwise. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Thailand intends to implement an Electronic Travel Authorisation process for visa-exempt travellers in the coming months. As of 12 December 2024, this system has not yet been implemented. Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Thailand are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and to stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (Twitter @[**IrlEmbBangkok**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbBangkok) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyThailand)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

In the event of an emergency, first call the Thai Tourist Police at 1155. Please contact the Embassy of Ireland at +66 (0) 2 0161360. Outside of working hours in the event of a genuine emergency, please leave a message.
