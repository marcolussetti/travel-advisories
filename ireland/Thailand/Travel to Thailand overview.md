There is currently a heightened risk of terrorism in Thailand.

Terrorist attacks occur in the country from time to time, including in the capital, Bangkok, and in popular tourist destinations such as Phuket and Krabi. Since mid-June 2025, a number of suspected explosive devices have been detected by the Thai Security Forces in popular tourist locations in southern Thailand. This includes one incident at Phuket Airport. Irish citizens are advised to be vigilant at all times. Citizens are advised to factor in extra time for security checks ahead of flights due to additional security measures. So citizens are advised to check with airlines and allow sufficient time at airports ahead of scheduled departures. Please follow the advice of Thai Authorities, avoid any large gatherings and be aware of your personal safety at all times.

There is an ongoing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia, which has led to occasional clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops. Due to cross-border tensions, land crossings between Thailand and Cambodia have been subject to temporary closures and restrictions. Irish citizens should take extra care when travelling in areas close to the border and follow the instructions and advice of the national and local authorities. Travellers intending to travel by land between the two countries should check in advance to make sure that border crossings are open in order to avoid travel delay or disruption.

### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Thailand for the purpose of tourism or short-term business engagements for a period not exceeding 60 days. A valid passport is required for travel to Thailand. Thai immigration authorities are known to adopt a strict approach to accepting damaged passports. Irish citizens are advised to renew their passport before travel to Thailand should it have any damage as Thai Immigration may refuse entry otherwise. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

From May 1 2025, all non-Thai nationals entering Thailand are required to complete the Thailand Digital Arrival Card within 3 days of their date of arrival. The application portal and further details can be found here: <https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home>

Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

We advise against all but essential travel to areas near the Thai-Malaysia border, including the three provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani due to the risk of violence.
