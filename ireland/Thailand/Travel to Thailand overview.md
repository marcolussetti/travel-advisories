## Travel to Thailand overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

We advise against all travel to the entirety of the border region between Thailand and Cambodia, where armed clashes have taken place between Thai and Cambodian armed forces. The clashes have resulted in fatalities including civilian fatalities, and land mines remain present in the disputed border regions. Border crossings are subject to restrictions and closures, and there is a possibility of disruption to air travel between the two countries. While a ceasefire has been agreed, the situation remains fluid and Irish citizens in Thailand and Cambodia or intending to visit should pay close attention to authoritative sources of information and advice, and remain vigilant at all times. The Thai government has announced a national mourning period beginning on 25 October following the death of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit The Queen Mother. Entertainment activities may be restricted or scaled back during this time, and members of the public have been asked to wear black or dark coloured clothing for a period of 90 days. Irish citizens travelling to Thailand during this time are advised to inform themselves of the local situation and to remain respectful at all times.

There were two confirmed fatal cases of tickborne Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) in Wang Pong District, Phetchabun Province in north-central Thailand in late June 2025. Members of the public are advised to reduce their risk of infection from tick-borne diseases by avoiding contact with ticks, particularly in rural or forested areas and by wearing protective clothing, using tick repellents and performing body checks after outdoor activities.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Thailand for the purpose of tourism or short-term business engagements for a period not exceeding 60 days. A valid passport is required for travel to Thailand. Thai immigration authorities are known to adopt a strict approach to accepting damaged passports. Irish citizens are advised to renew their passport before travel to Thailand should it have any damage as Thai Immigration may refuse entry otherwise. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

From May 1 2025, all non-Thai nationals entering Thailand are required to complete the Thailand Digital Arrival Card within 3 days of their date of arrival. The application portal and further details can be found on the [**Thailand Digital Arrival Card**](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home) website.

Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

We advise against all but essential travel to areas near the Thai-Malaysia border, including the three provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani due to the risk of violence.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Thailand are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and to stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X @[**IrlEmbBangkok**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbBangkok) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyThailand)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
