There is an ongoing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia, which has led to occasional clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops.

A valid passport is required for travel to Thailand. Thai immigration authorities are known to adopt a strict approach to accepting damaged passports. Irish citizens are advised to renew their passport before travel to Thailand should it have any damage as Thai Immigration may refuse entry otherwise.

Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

We advise against all but essential travel to areas near the Thai-Malaysia border, including the three provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani due to the risk of violence.
