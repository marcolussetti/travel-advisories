## Travel to Thailand overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Cambodia Border Region**

We advise against all travel to the entirety of the border region between Thailand and Cambodia, where armed clashes have taken place between Thai and Cambodian armed forces. The clashes have resulted in fatalities including civilian fatalities, and land mines remain present in the disputed border regions. Border crossings are subject to restrictions and closures, and there is a possibility of disruption to air travel between the two countries. While a ceasefire has been agreed, the situation remains fluid and Irish citizens in Thailand and Cambodia or intending to visit should pay close attention to authoritative sources of information and advice, and remain vigilant at all times.

#### **Terrorism**

There is currently a heightened risk of terrorism in Thailand.

Terrorist attacks occur in the country from time to time, including in the capital, Bangkok, and in popular tourist destinations such as Phuket and Krabi. A number of suspected explosive devices have been detected by the Thai Security Forces, in a number of popular tourist locations in southern Thailand in the period since mid-June 2025. One incident occurred at Phuket Airport. Irish citizens are advised to be vigilant at all times. Additional security measures put in place in response to these incidents may require intending passengers to factor in extra time for security checks ahead of flights, so you should make sure to check with airlines and allow sufficient time at airports ahead of scheduled departures. Please follow the advice of Thai Authorities, avoid any large gatherings and be aware of your personal safety at all times.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Thailand for the purpose of tourism or short-term business engagements for a period not exceeding 60 days. A valid passport is required for travel to Thailand. Thai immigration authorities are known to adopt a strict approach to accepting damaged passports. Irish citizens are advised to renew their passport before travel to Thailand should it have any damage as Thai Immigration may refuse entry otherwise. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

From May 1 2025, all non-Thai nationals entering Thailand are required to complete the Thailand Digital Arrival Card within 3 days of their date of arrival. The application portal and further details can be found on the [**Thailand Digital Arrival Card**](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home) website.

Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

We advise against all but essential travel to areas near the Thai-Malaysia border, including the three provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani due to the risk of violence.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Thailand are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and to stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X @[**IrlEmbBangkok**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbBangkok) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyThailand)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
