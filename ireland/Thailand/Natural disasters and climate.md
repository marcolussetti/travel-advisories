## Natural disasters and climate

### Rain and Flooding

The rainy season in much of Thailand runs from May to October. Monsoon rains and storms quite often lead to heavy and dangerous flooding. The rainy season in south east of the Thai peninsula runs from November to March. You can get useful information on the weather conditions in Thailand from websites such as [**Phuket Weather Forecasts**](http://www.phuket.com/island/weather.htm), the [**Thai Meteorological Department**](https://www.tmd.go.th/en/) or [**Tourism Authority of Thailand News**](http://www.tatnews.org/).

### Earthquakes

Thailand is in an earthquake zone and experiences earthquakes and tremors from time to time. These can trigger tsunami alerts. A major earthquake in Myanmar in March 2025 caused damage and fatalities in Bangkok and was felt across many parts of Thailand. There continues to be ongoing seismic activity in the Andaman Sea area close to Thailand. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake, and take note of earthquake and tsunami-related instructions from your hotel or the local authorities.

### Air Pollution

Air pollution can be an issue in Thailand, particularly in the major cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can lead to various health issues, such as eye and skin irritation and headaches, and can aggravate underlying health conditions such as cardiac and respiratory conditions.

Irish Citizens with respiratory conditions or other underlying health conditions, which may be affected by the air pollution, should take caution being outdoors during periods of high air pollution.
