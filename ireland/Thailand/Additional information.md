## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Thailand intends to implement an Electronic Travel Authorisation process for visa-exempt travellers in the coming months. As of 12 December 2024, this system has not yet been implemented. Please consult the website of the Royal Thai Embassy in London for the most up-to-date information regarding entry requirements for Thailand.

### **Visas**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Thailand for the purpose of tourism or short-term business engagements for a period not exceeding 60 days. It is against the law to overstay your visa to Thailand so check the period of stay authorised by the Thai authorities when you arrive. If you 'surrender' yourself to immigration at the airport or at any other immigration bureau following a short overstay, you must pay a fine for each excess day. However, be aware that for longer periods of overstay, it is entirely at the discretion of the Thai immigration whether you pay an over-stay fine or are detained and deported at your own expense. Irish citizens have often been detained for a number of days prior to being deported for overstays. It is not a pleasant experience. And it is expensive. You may also be banned from re-entering Thailand for a set period. These determinations are made by the Royal Thai Government and the Irish Embassy cannot intervene in the application of Thai law. Please obey the laws of Thailand in relation to permission to stay in Thailand.

Private "visa extension services", even those advertising in major periodicals or located close to Immigration offices or police stations, are illegal. A number of foreign citizens, including Irish, have been arrested and detained at border crossings each year with counterfeit visas and entry stamps they have obtained through these illegal services. Please do not use private visa extension services.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required to enter Thailand, with at least six months validity. Be aware that a number of Irish citizens have been refused entry to Thailand for trying to enter the country on a damaged passport. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. By law you must carry your passport with you at all times. Tourists have been detained because they were unable to produce their passport.

### **Damaged Passports**

The Embassy has experienced an increasing amount of Irish citizens who have been refused entry to/exit from Thailand because their passports are damaged. We very strongly advise you to make sure that your passport is in excellent condition before you travel to Thailand and that you look after it very carefully while you are in Thailand.
