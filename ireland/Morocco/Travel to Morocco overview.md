**Passport Card not accepted for travel to Morocco:** A passport card is **not** accepted as it is only valid for travel within the EU, EEA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), Switzerland and the UK. If you seek to enter Morocco on a passport card, you may be detained airside in the airport for several days until the next direct flight back to Ireland.

Irish citizens **do not require** a visa to enter Morocco.

A valid passport is required for travel to Morocco. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months at least from date of entry into Morocco.

Visitors to Morocco are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Irish citizens planning travel to Morocco are advised to remain vigilant and exercise caution during their stay. While Morocco is not immune to the global risk of indiscriminate terror attacks, the most recent Global Terrorism Index report indicates a lowered risk of terrorism in the country. However, citizens are advised to avoid large public gatherings and avoid any political protests, while also taking precautions to ensure their personal safety.
