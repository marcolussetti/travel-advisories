## Safety and security

### **Social Unrest**

Regional developments have the potential to trigger popular unrest in Morocco. Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

### **Terrorism**

There is a risk of terrorist attacks in Morocco which could target places popular with tourists such as hotels, bars, cafes and beaches. Visitors should be vigilant during their stay.

### **Crime**

Most visitors find Morocco relatively trouble free. However, you should take the usual, sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Morocco, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Rabat**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/morocco/rabat/) if help is required.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Morocco, be extremely careful. Morocco has a poor road safety record, and you should stay well within speed limits. If intending to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Swimming**

If visiting Agadir’s resorts, be aware of the often dangerous rip currents in the sea off the main resort.
