## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Morocco is a Muslim country. Visitors should respect local customs and sensitivities at all times, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, Muslims, who make up the majority of Moroccoâ€™s population, are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, visitors should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

Women, especially when travelling alone, attract attention. Visitors are advised to dress modestly and avoid wearing clothes that could be seen as provocative, except on the beach.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is considered a criminal offence in Morocco.

### **Sexual behaviour**

Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law. Discretion and caution are advised at all times.
