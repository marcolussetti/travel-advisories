## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Morocco is a Muslim country. Visitors should respect local customs and sensitivities at all times, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, Muslims, who make up the majority of Morocco’s population, are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, visitors should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

Women, especially when travelling alone, attract attention. Visitors are advised to dress modestly and avoid wearing clothes that could be seen as provocative, except on the beach.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is considered a criminal offence in Morocco.

### **Sexual Behaviour**

Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law. Discretion and caution are advised at all times.

### **Getting Married in Morocco**

Irish citizens who wish to marry in Morocco must obtain a police clearance certificate from An Garda Siochána. This must be obtained in advance of travelling to Morocco. For further information, please see [**www.garda.ie**](http://www.garda.ie/). Irish citizens may also wish to note that a non-Muslim man who wishes to marry a Muslim woman should anticipate one to three months to complete the process, including the time needed to convert to Islam. In general, the process is less complicated for a Muslim man who wishes to marry a non-Muslim woman.
