### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. An appropriate travel insurance policy should cover these costs, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities planned for your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) to purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Policies should cover:  
 • All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.  
 • Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.  
 • 24-hour emergency service and assistance.  
 • Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).  
 • Lost and stolen possessions.  
 • Cancellation and curtailment.  
 • Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Visitors should know most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
