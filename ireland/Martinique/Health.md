### **Travel and Medical Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. These costs will be covered by an appropriate travel insurance policy bought before departure, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

There have been outbreaks of Dengue fever and of Zika/Chikungunya virus in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/).
