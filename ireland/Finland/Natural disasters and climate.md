## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Summer is generally warm with relatively mild weather in spring and autumn. Mosquitoes can be prevalent during warm weather, particularly in the north of the country, so youâ€™ll need a supply of insect repellent.

Winter temperatures can be very cold and warm clothing and footwear is essential.

### **Air quality**

Air quality in Helsinki at certain times of the year (late spring/early summer) can be poor and, if you suffer from allergies, you may find your condition is worse at these times.
