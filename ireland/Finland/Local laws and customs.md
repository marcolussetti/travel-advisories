## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and itâ€™s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Drinking in public places in built-up areas and on public transport is forbidden in Finland. The police have the right to confiscate any object or substance that may be dangerous. Anyone who violates this law may be taken to a detoxification centre and/or fined.

### **Finnish-Russian Border**

Since December 2023, the land border between Finland and Russia has been closed, therefore all land border crossing points are closed until further notice. The border crossing points for maritime traffic are also closed to leisure boating until further notice. Anyone who attempts to enter the border zone or to cross the border into Russia illegally may be charged with border offences, which can carry a fine or a prison sentence.
