## Entry requirements

You need a valid passport to visit Finland and we advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

Irish citizens do not require a visa for Finland. However if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your details with the Local Register Office.
