## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Finland's Security Intelligence Service (SUPO) assesses the current terrorist threat level as "elevated" (number two on a scale of one to four; one being low and four being severe). There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Finland but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Finland, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Helsinki if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Finland, you should take care, particularly during the winter months, when the roads can be hazardous and icy conditions are common. If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Drive with dimmed headlights at all times.
* Make sure your car has winter/snow tyres (either studded or non-studded) from 1 December to 31 March – this is a legal requirement.

### **Vehicle hire**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
