## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

You need a valid passport to visit Finland and we advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

Irish citizens do not require a visa for Finland. However if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your details with the Local Register Office.

### **Currency**

The currency of Finland is the Euro.

### **Climate**

Summer is generally warm with relatively mild weather in spring and autumn. Mosquitoes can be prevalent during warm weather, particularly in the north of the country, so youâ€™ll need a supply of insect repellent.

Winter temperatures can be very cold and warm clothing and footwear is essential.

### **Air quality**

Air quality in Helsinki at certain times of the year (late spring/early summer) can be poor and, if you suffer from allergies, you may find your condition is worse at these times.
