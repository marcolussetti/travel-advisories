Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Finland.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Finland. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register their presence with the [**Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV)**](https://dvv.fi/en/individuals).

Visitors to Finland are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbFinland**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbFinland) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbFinland/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
