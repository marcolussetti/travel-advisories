### **Medical Care**

You may be charged a standard fee at public health centres depending on the treatment you receive and where you receive it.

There’s a fixed daily charge for both in-patient treatment and outpatient visits at public hospitals, which are non-refundable. However, you may be able to claim a partial refund on private treatment from either a doctor or a hospital if you submit a receipt to the local KELA (the Social Insurance Institute of Finland) office. You must claim refunds for medical expenses within six months of the original payment.

### **Prescription Drugs**

You can get prescription drugs from any pharmacy. You'll be charged the full cost but you may be able to claim a refund from the local KELA office. See details at the following link [**http://www.kela.fi/web/en/medicine-expenses?inheritRedirect=true**](http://www.kela.fi/web/en/medicine-expenses?inheritRedirect=true)

For most prescribed medicines, you can be reimbursed for the medicines you purchase after you have met the initial deductible which is 50 euros per calendar year.

### **Travel Insurance**

We can’t pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you haven’t broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if you’re making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you’re sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: You should know most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

As an Irish resident you are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay there. Ensure that you get or renew your EHIC (the new name for the E111) before you go, and remember, you need one for every person travelling in your group.

You can apply for your EHIC and find out more information [**here**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It doesn’t cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so you should check with the hospital administrator beforehand.
