## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter Cape Verde for stays up to 30 days. Passports must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of entry.

All passengers travelling to Cape Verde from overseas need to:

Pre-register on the EASE platform ([**https://www.ease.gov.cv/**](https://www.ease.gov.cv/)) at least 5 days before their date of travel;

Pay the Airport Security Tax (TSA; Taxa de Segurança Aeroportuária), which is 150 CVE (approx. €1.36 at time of writing) for domestic flights and  3400 CVE (€30.83) for international flights.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Cape Verde and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re in Cape Verde you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Lisbon**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/portugal/). We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
