## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

While the threat from terrorism is minimal, it is important not to rule out the risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark.
* Petty crimes like pick-pocketing or handbag snatching can occur, including on beaches. They particularly occur during festivals and street fairs, and in crowded outdoor market areas, particularly on the island of São Vicente, in Praia and on the island of Santiago
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Lock doors and windows at night.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime, report it to the local police immediately.

### **Road safety**

Cape Verde has an extensive road system. On the islands of Santiago, Sal, and São Vicente, many urban and rural roads are asphalt. On the other islands, some roads are narrow, winding and poorly lit, and mostly cobblestone.  
During the rainy season, cobblestone roads are especially slippery, and mud and rockslides are common on roads that cut through mountains. Roads and streets often are unlit and driving at night is hazardous. Main roads are usually paved with cobblestones but can be narrow, winding and poorly lit.  
Drivers and pedestrians should exercise caution, particularly after dark.

### **Public transportation**

Praia has three principal modes of public transport: taxi, city buses, and intercity commuter van service. The use of Intercity van service is strongly discouraged due to the bad driving habits of local residents.  
While official taxis are considered safe and reliable, passengers should still exercise good common sense and avoid sharing a taxi with strangers.  
In Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition.

### **Maritime Safety**

Sea conditions can be treacherous and mariners should take extra care and seek local advice prior to travel. Advise local ports of arrival and departure times and provide relatives with your itinerary.
