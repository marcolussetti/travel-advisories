## Health

Irish health authorities have classified Cape Verde as a country where there is a risk of Zika virus transmission, and advise for pregnant and women planning on becoming pregnant to postpone all non-essential travel.

Irish Health authorities also categorise Cape Verde as one of the high risk countries where the rates of hepatitis C are high. There is also a low risk of malaria in the capital city, Praia (Santiago Island).

### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We can’t advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre. Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
