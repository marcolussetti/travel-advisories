## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Cape Verde, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Lisbon, Portugal**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/portugal/lisbon/)**.**

Please note that if you require assistance in the case of emergency while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy number, 00 351 213308200, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox.

This mailbox will be monitored regularly.

Monday to Friday 9.30am to 12.30pm
