There has been significant structural damage across the region leading to casualties. Citizens in these areas may experience continued disruption to local transport, accommodation options and other services and should heed the instructions of the Turkish authorities. Roads, communications networks and airports may be badly disrupted.

### **Fires**

Türkiye can experience bush and forest fires in the warmer months, including in regions popular with tourists. Heed risk warnings and be vigilant if travelling in forested areas during the summer. If there is a forest fire near where you are staying, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of the Turkish authorities.

Emergency services can be contacted by dialling **112**.

Rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides in Türkiye, including in the summer months. This can create risks to safety, as well as impeding travel and reducing the availability of essential services. If in an affected area, follow the advice of the local authorities.
