High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Our general advice to Irish citizens in Türkiye or those who intend to travel to Türkiye is to **exercise a high degree of caution** at all times. Avoid all protests and demonstrations and minimise time spent in crowded areas, particularly those frequented by foreigners, follow local security advice, and monitor local media. You should also devise and/or review a personal security plan.

Large demonstrations have taken place in Istanbul and other Turkish cities since March 19. A ban on demonstrations is currently in place and a number of restrictions on transport and movement within the city are in effect.

**The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel within 10 kilometres of the border between Türkiye and Syria.**

**The Department advises against all but essential travel to the provinces of Hatay, Kilis and Sirnak.**

Please also be aware that the police in Türkiye can take measures such as the use of tear gas to control protesters. Ensure you have a charged mobile phone at all times. Please carry ID / passport at all times, presenting to security officers if requested (and keep a copy to hand also).

### **Entry to Türkiye**

Irish citizens require a passport with minimum 150 days’ validity to enter Türkiye. Passport cards are **not** accepted in Türkiye.

Visas are not required for Irish citizens to enter Türkiye for stays of up to 90 days within any 180 day period for purposes such as tourism and business travel. However, if you are using another category of passport for official travel to Türkiye, you should contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara in advance of your visit for further information. The nearest Turkish Embassy can also clarify any visa requirements.

Dual citizens (including children) should ensure that they also carry a valid Irish passport to ensure no issues are encountered when travelling back to Ireland.)

If you are a foreign national travelling with a “[Travel Document](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/applying-for-a-travel-document/#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20a,on%20a%20paper%20application%20form.)” issued by Ireland, you will need a Turkish visa prior to travel and should contact the Turkish Embassy in Dublin. This includes Travel Document holders who are family members (e.g. children) of Irish citizens. Failure to produce a visa on arrival in Türkiye will result in refusal to grant entry to the country by border police.

If refused entry to Türkiye for the reasons listed above, you will be held in the airport pending deportation on the next available flight back to your original destination with the airline company you travelled with. The Embassy is not able to intervene in the decisions taken by Turkish immigration authorities.
