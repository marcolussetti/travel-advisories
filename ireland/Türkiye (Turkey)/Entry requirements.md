## Entry requirements

### Passport

Irish citizens require a passport with minimum 150 days validity to enter Türkiye. Passport cards are **not** accepted in Türkiye.

Visitors should check their passports in plenty of time before travel. The Embassy cannot intervene on citizens’ behalves if you do not meet the entry requirements. If your passport needs to be renewed, please use our [**Online Passport Renewal System**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Visitors are advised to bring a number of passport photocopies while travelling and carry a photocopy of passport at all times.

### Visa

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Türkiye for stays of up to 90 days within any 180-day period, for purposes such as tourism and business travel. Individuals planning official travel using another category of passport should contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara for further information. The nearest Turkish Embassy can also clarify any visa requirements. Contact details for the Turkish Embassy in Dublin are available [**here**](http://dublin.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission).

### **Land Border**

**Citizens seeking to enter Türkiye overland from Iran should contact the Embassy of Ireland, Ankara, or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Ireland, as soon as possible before they travel.** The Turkish authorities require requests for foreign nationals to cross the land border from Iran to Türkiye to be communicated, in advance, by the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara. Citizens must also have a valid Irish passport with minimum 150 days’ validity to enter Türkiye. Any citizens planning travel to Türkiye are also advised to make plans for onward travel as early as possible as flights and other transport may have limited availability.

### **Refused Entry**

If a citizen is refused entry to Türkiye, they will be held in the airport pending deportation on the next available flight back to their original destination on the airline company they travelled with. The Embassy is not able to intervene in the decisions taken by Turkish immigration authorities.

### **Dual Citizenship**

Dual citizens, including children, should ensure that they also carry a valid Irish passport to ensure no issues are encountered when travelling back to Ireland.

Foreign nationals travelling with a “[**Travel Document**](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/applying-for-a-travel-document/#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20a,on%20a%20paper%20application%20form.)” issued by Ireland will need a Turkish visa prior to travel and should contact the Turkish Embassy in Dublin. This includes Travel Document holders who are family members (e.g. children) of Irish citizens. Failure to produce a visa on arrival in Türkiye will result in refusal to grant entry to the country by border police.

### **Residence Permit**

If planning to study, work or stay beyond 90 days in Türkiye, Irish citizens must apply for the appropriate visa and/or residence permit from the Turkish authorities. Residence permits for Irish citizens are free of charge, however there is a fee for the residence permit booklet. Applications and requests for further information should be directed towards the local branch of the Directorate General of Migration Management. Residence permits are not free of charge for all foreign nationals, so Irish citizens may need to remember this when applying for a permit.

### **Travelling with Children**

If exiting Türkiye with a child who is a dual Irish-Turkish citizen, accompanying adults may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
