### **Medical, Dental, and Cosmetic Procedures**

Irish citizens travel to Türkiye each year for the purpose of medical services, including surgical, dental and cosmetic procedures. **Individuals should be aware that** **all** **surgery contains an element of risk and** the Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of citizens who have experienced complications in the course of their treatment in Türkiye, and a number who have died.

Irish citizens considering treatment in Türkiye are advised to carry out independent research regarding the credentials of any potential service provider. A list of accredited facilities is available on the  Turkish Government’s [Health Türkiye website](https://healthturkiye.com/homepage), and the Health Türkiye call centre, which provides information in English, can be reached by calling +90 850 288 3838.

It is essential that appropriate travel insurance is in place. **A European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cannot be used in Türkiye.**

Individuals should inform themselves of both the risks and benefits of any procedures, and are advised to discuss their plans carefully with their own doctor, dentist and/or hospital specialist before committing to any procedure abroad. They should also read the contract/agreement in full and ensure that they understand their plan of care.

Individuals should also familiarise themselves with any follow-up treatment or process that may be required. It may be helpful to request a discharge summary in English from the treating doctor, dentist, or medical professionals. Some airlines may request a Fit to Fly certificate on boarding and this should also be sought prior to discharge.

Individuals should also be aware that they may encounter communication difficulties in a non-English speaking environment.

The Embassy cannot provide financial or legal assistance to individuals who experience difficulty following medical, dental or cosmetic treatment abroad.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Department of Foreign Affairs cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad.  These costs may be covered if you purchase appropriate travel insurance, however the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara is unable to mediate in the event of any disputes with insurance companies which may arise.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities planned during trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

The Turkish health system is well developed and adept to working with insurance companies, particularly in areas frequented by tourists.

### **Mental Health**

Please be aware that the standard of mental healthcare in Türkiye differs from Ireland. It can be difficult to access appropriate medical facilities that have mental healthcare professionals who speak English. Pre-existing mental health issues should be declared when purchasing travel insurance as otherwise the policy may not cover treatment or hospital costs.

Please consult a doctor before travelling. Ensure you have sufficient amount of medication for your trip, along with an up-to-date prescription or letter from your doctor. Be aware that heat and hot weather can impact mental health and the effectiveness of certain medication.

If you become concerned for your mental health (or the mental health of a friend / family member) while in Türkiye please contact the Embassy (+90 312 4591000) or the Consular Assistance team in Dublin (+353 1 408 2000). We can direct you to local medical facilities and help you make contact with friends / family in Türkiye or Ireland. Please note the Embassy cannot provide medical advice or funds to return home.

### **Emergency expenses**

Check your insurance policy to see if it covers the following:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

### **Water**

There have been water-quality issues in Türkiye and visitors are advised to use bottled water whenever possible.
