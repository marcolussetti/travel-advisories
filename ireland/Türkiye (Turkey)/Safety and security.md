## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

The threat from terrorism in Türkiye remains high, with bomb attacks in major Turkish cities, including Istanbul and Ankara. Although some attacks have targeted security forces, there have also been random attacks in areas frequented by tourists. The situation in the southeast of the country is particularly serious and these areas should be avoided (see below).

Terrorist attacks are, by their nature, random and indiscriminate and cannot be predicted in advance. Visitors are advised to exercise a high degree of caution, particularly in public places that are frequented by foreigners.

### **Regional Issues**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel within 10 kilometres of the border between Türkiye and Syria. We also advise against all but essential travel to the provinces of Hatay, Kilis and Sirnak.**

While areas popular with Irish visitors are located at a substantial distance from these regions, vigilance is also required in tourist areas in major cities.

Stay away from military sites. Taking photos of, or near, military or security installations and some public buildings, may be prohibited.

### **Protests and Demonstrations**

Large demonstrations have taken place in Istanbul and other Turkish cities since March 19 2025. A ban on demonstrations is currently in place and a number of restrictions on transport and movement within the city have been and may come into effect. Avoid all protests and demonstrations and minimise time spent in crowded areas, particularly those frequented by foreigners, follow local security advice, and monitor local media.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can turn confrontational. The police may take measures such as the use of tear gas to control protesters.

### **Crime**

Petty crime such as street robbery and pickpocketing can occur in the major tourist areas of Istanbul and other large cities. There have been cases of tourists being intimidated into paying extortionate bills at bars and nightclubs. There have also been cases of theft from apartments and cars in some of the coastal resorts, as well as in Istanbul and Ankara.

Crimes including muggings, assault, sexual harassment and sexual assault can also occur. If you are the victim of a crime, the Embassy can offer confidential support, including advice on how to access appropriate services e.g. English-speaking lawyers, local police and medical services. It may be advisable to report an assault to the nearest police station as soon as possible and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

Take heed of local tour operator representatives’ advice, and wherever you are, take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary, but carry a photocopy of it in case stopped by police. Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home. Ensure that at least one family member in Ireland is aware of your location and travel plans in Türkiye, should an emergency arise communications by email or mobile phone can be difficult.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Do not leave valuables, or bags that may appear to contain valuables, visible in parked cars.
* Remain vigilant when frequenting bar and nightclubs.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Türkiye, and visitors wish to report it, contact the nearest local police station immediately to file a report. Citizens can also contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara for consular assistance.

It is especially important to report the loss or theft of passports to the nearest local police station.

Emergency services can be contacted by dialling 112.

### **Spiked Food and Drink**

Exercise a high level of vigilance in bars, nightclubs and any crowded areas where food and drink are consumed. Spiking of food and drink with drugs can occur. Always keep your drink with you and avoid accepting food or drinks from strangers or new acquaintances. If you do begin to feel strange or unwell, contact a trusted friend straight away who should help take you to a safe place such as the hotel or accommodation where you are staying.

### **Counterfeit Alcohol**

In a small number of cases, consumption of counterfeit alcohol has caused hospitalisations and deaths in Türkiye. Be alert to the potential risks around methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Try to ensure that drinks are poured from an original, sealed bottle.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Türkiye, be careful. While the standard of roads in Türkiye has greatly improved in recent years, traffic accidents are common, particularly at night. Road safety standards are low, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by poor driving, badly maintained vehicles and inadequate lighting. Pedestrians should also exercise caution at all times, including at zebra crossings, for example, as drivers rarely stop to allow pedestrians to cross.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware of Türkiye's traffic laws, such as speed limits.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times. Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

It is advisable to use taxis ordered by hotels or directly from a taxi kiosk where possible. In Istanbul and other tourist areas, always ensure the taxi meter is on at the beginning of your journey.

### **Extreme Sports**

If participating in extreme sports (including hot-air ballooning), be satisfied that appropriate safety precautions are in place. There have been a number of hot-air ballooning accidents in Cappadocia in the past, which have led to a number of fatalities. There have also been a number of fatalities and serious injuries in paragliding accidents in the resorts of Oludeniz and Fethiye. Only use reputable operators and insist on training before use. Make sure your travel insurance covers all the activities you want to undertake, as often they are excluded in standard policies.

### **Stray Dogs**

Stray street dogs are common in most towns and cities in Türkiye. Local authorities take action to control and manage numbers but packs congregate in parks and wastelands. While they are largely docile, this may not always be the case. Avoid approaching these dogs but if bitten, seek immediate medical advice as rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Türkiye.
