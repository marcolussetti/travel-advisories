## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a passport with minimum 150 days validity to enter Türkiye. Passport cards are **not** accepted in Türkiye.

Please check your passport in plenty of time before travel as entry may be refused. The Embassy cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet the entry requirements. If your passport needs to be renewed, please use our [**Online Passport Renewal System**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Visas are not required for Irish citizens to enter Türkiye for stays of up to 90 days within any 180 day period for purposes such as tourism and business travel. However, if you are using another category of passport for official travel to Türkiye, you should contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara in advance of your visit for further informationThe nearest Turkish Embassy can also clarify any visa requirements. Contact details for the Turkish Embassy in Dublin are available [**here**](http://dublin.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission).

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport while travelling and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

### **Residence permit**

If planning to study, work or stay beyond 90 days in Türkiye you must apply for the appropriate visa and/or residence permit from the Turkish authorities. Residence permits for Irish citizens are free of charge, though you have to pay for the residence permit booklet. Applications and requests for further information should be directed towards the local branch of the Directorate General of Migration Management. Residence permits are not free of charge for all foreign nationals, so you may find that you have to insist that this is the case when you apply for a permit.

### **Overstaying your visa**

Overstaying your visa can result in heavy fines and/or a ban on re-entering Türkiye for up to five years, depending on the length of the overstay, and you will need to apply for a visa from the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate before returning to Türkiye. Departing Türkiye without paying the relevant fine will lead to an automatic five year ban on re-entry.

Visa requirements for Irish citizens are a matter for the Turkish immigration authorities and the Irish Embassy cannot intervene in individual cases relating to visas and overstays.

### **Travelling with children**

If leaving Türkiye with a child who is a dual Irish-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.

### **Buying property**

If intending to buy property in Türkiye, we strongly advise to consult an independent legal advisor from the beginning of the process. Procedures in relation to property purchases differ significantly from those in Ireland and investors are advised to research the matter thoroughly before entering into any agreement.

For general advice on property purchases in Türkiye, check the [**Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Guidance for Foreigners**](http://www.mfa.gov.tr/guidance-for-foreigners.en.mfa).
