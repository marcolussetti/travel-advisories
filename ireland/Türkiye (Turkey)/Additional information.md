## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a passport with minimum 150 days validity to enter Türkiye. Passport cards are **not** accepted in Türkiye.

Visitors should check their passports in plenty of time before travel. The Embassy cannot intervene on citizens’ behalves if you do not meet the entry requirements. If your passport needs to be renewed, please use our [**Online Passport Renewal System**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Türkiye for stays of up to 90 days within any 180-day period, for purposes such as tourism and business travel. Individuals planning official travel using another category of passport should contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara for further information. The nearest Turkish Embassy can also clarify any visa requirements. Contact details for the Turkish Embassy in Dublin are available [**here**](http://dublin.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission).

If a citizen is refused entry to Türkiye, they will be held in the airport pending deportation on the next available flight back to their original destination on the airline company they travelled with. The Embassy is not able to intervene in the decisions taken by Turkish immigration authorities.

Dual citizens, including children, should ensure that they also carry a valid Irish passport to ensure no issues are encountered when travelling back to Ireland.

Foreign nationals travelling with a “[**Travel Document**](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/applying-for-a-travel-document/#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20a,on%20a%20paper%20application%20form.)” issued by Ireland will need a Turkish visa prior to travel and should contact the Turkish Embassy in Dublin. This includes Travel Document holders who are family members (e.g. children) of Irish citizens. Failure to produce a visa on arrival in Türkiye will result in refusal to grant entry to the country by border police.

Visitors are advised to bring a number of passport photocopies while travelling and carry a photocopy of passport at all times.

### **Residence permit**

If planning to study, work or stay beyond 90 days in Türkiye, Irish citizens must apply for the appropriate visa and/or residence permit from the Turkish authorities. Residence permits for Irish citizens are free of charge, however there is a fee for the residence permit booklet. Applications and requests for further information should be directed towards the local branch of the Directorate General of Migration Management. Residence permits are not free of charge for all foreign nationals, so Irish citizens may need to remember this when applying for a permit.

### **Overstaying visas**

Overstaying your visa can result in heavy fines and/or a ban on re-entering Türkiye for up to 5 years, depending on the length of the overstay. Citizens would need to apply for a visa from the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate before returning to Türkiye. Departing Türkiye without paying the relevant fine will lead to an automatic five year ban on re-entry.

Visa requirements for Irish citizens are a matter for the Turkish immigration authorities and the Irish Embassy cannot intervene in individual cases relating to visas and overstays.

### **Travelling with children**

If exiting Türkiye with a child who is a dual Irish-Turkish citizen, accompanying adults may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.

### **Buying property**

Citizens intending to buy property in Türkiye are strongly advised to consult an independent legal advisor from the start of the process. Procedures in relation to property purchases differ significantly from those in Ireland and investors are advised to research the matter thoroughly before entering into any agreement.

For general advice on property purchases in Türkiye, check the [**Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Guidance for Foreigners**](http://www.mfa.gov.tr/guidance-for-foreigners.en.mfa).
