## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to visitors and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Local Customs**

Türkiye is a secular state with a majority Muslim population. Respect local traditions, customs, and religions, which can vary regionally.

In many areas popular with tourists, the dress code in Türkiye is similar to that in Europe. However, dress style is more conservative in rural areas, small towns and some neighbourhoods of larger cities. You should dress modestly if visiting a mosque or a religious shrine (long trousers or dress and women should wear a headscarf).

Alcohol is available but public drunkenness is frowned upon.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Türkiye has strict laws against the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. If convicted of any of these offences, expect to receive a heavy fine and a prison sentence of up to 15 years. The Embassy can provide contact information for English-speaking lawyers, but cannot get involved in legal cases.

### **Overstaying Visas**

Overstaying your visa can result in heavy fines and/or a ban on re-entering Türkiye for up to 5 years, depending on the length of the overstay. Citizens would need to apply for a visa from the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate before returning to Türkiye. Departing Türkiye without paying the relevant fine will lead to an automatic five year ban on re-entry.

Visa requirements for Irish citizens are a matter for the Turkish immigration authorities and the Irish Embassy cannot intervene in individual cases relating to visas and overstays.

### **Buying property**

Citizens intending to buy property in Türkiye are strongly advised to consult an independent legal advisor from the start of the process. Procedures in relation to property purchases differ significantly from those in Ireland and investors are advised to research the matter thoroughly before entering into any agreement.
