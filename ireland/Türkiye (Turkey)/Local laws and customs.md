## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Local customs**

Türkiye is a secular state with a majority Muslim population. Respect local traditions, customs, and religions, which can vary regionally. Normally, the dress code in Türkiye is the same as in Europe, however, you should dress modestly if visiting a mosque or a religious shrine (long trousers or dress and women should wear a headscarf). Alcohol is widely available but public drunkenness is frowned upon.

### **Illegal drugs**

Türkiye has strict laws against the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. If convicted of any of these offences, expect to receive a heavy fine and a prison sentence of up to 15 years. The Embassy maintains a list of English-speaking lawyers, but cannot get involved in legal cases.
