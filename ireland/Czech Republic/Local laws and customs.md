## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it’s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Identification**

Visitors and Czech nationals are required by law to carry ID in public at all times. Anyone failing to do so may be fined or brought to the nearest police station to have their identity verified.

Tourists are obliged to carry their passport card or passport at all times for identification purposes. A driving licence won’t suffice and a photocopy of the passport is not sufficient either. It may be advisable to email copies of your passport to yourself before departure or to take a number of photocopies of it along with you.

### **Currency Exchange**

Never exchange money with vendors on the street as this money is often counterfeit. Money can be withdrawn from ATMs or exchanged at a bank or currency exchange office.

When using a currency exchange office, always check the rate offered and agree on the amount to be received in return for money to be given, before undertaking the actual exchange. If you’re dissatisfied with the service or rate provided at a particular exchange office, you can file a complaint report (reklamační protokol) with the local police.
