## Additional information

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter the Czech Republic. However, visitors who intend to stay in the Czech Republic for longer than 30 days should report their presence to the local Foreign Police Department.

### **Currency exchange**

Never exchange money with vendors on the street as this money is often counterfeit. Money can be withdrawn from ATMs or exchanged at a bank or currency exchange office.

When using a currency exchange office, always check the rate offered and agree on the amount to be received in return for money to be given, before undertaking the actual exchange. If you’re dissatisfied with the service or rate provided at a particular exchange office, you can file a complaint report (reklamační protokol) with the local police.
