## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in the Czech Republic is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in the Czech Republic but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Petty theft and pickpocketing are problems, particularly in Prague. It’s especially important to be vigilant at the main tourist attractions, airports, railway stations, and on public transport, particularly on routes to and from Prague Castle and other major tourist sites.
* If approached by an individual claiming to be a police officer, decline to show your money but offer instead to go with him or her to the nearest police station or call 158 or 112 to check their identity.
* Czech authorities have reported several incidents of deaths and hospitalisations resulting from the consumption of tainted spirits. You should take extra care when drinking or buying spirits in the Czech Republic as instances of methanol poisoning have been reported. We recommend that you only buy alcohol from legitimate vendors and ensure the seal around the cap or cork has not been broken.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re the victim of a crime while in the Czech Republic, report it in-person at a local police station, and get a police report (‘policejní zpráva’) and police report crime number.

You can report it to any police station. However, the Embassy is aware that at the following police stations there are officers who speak English:

Vlašská 3,

Praha 1,

Malá Strana (very close to the Irish Embassy),

24-hour phone: +420 974 851 730.

Můstek,

Jungmannovo náměstí 9,

Prague 1 (just off Wenceslas Square), 24-hour phone: +420 974 851 750.

You can also get a police report and police report crime number once you’re back in Ireland by sending a letter or email, which can be written in English, describing what happened, to the following address:

Policejní prezidium – podatelna,

Strojnická 27,

170 89 Praha 7,

Czech Republic,

### **Pedestrians**

Trams always have right of way, even at pedestrian crossings. There are a number of accidents involving trams every year and it’s important to take extra care if you’re in the vicinity of tram tracks.

The Czech police fine individuals caught attempting to cross a road or tram tracks within 50 metres of a pedestrian crossing. Fines are also levied against those who cross at a pedestrian crossing when the green pedestrian crossing light is not illuminated.

Extra care should be taken at pedestrian crossings as motorists in the Czech Republic don’t always stop despite being obliged to do so by the law.

### **Public Transport**

You must buy tickets for public transport before travelling and validate them at the start of your journey at the yellow machines, which are located at the top of the escalators/stairs in metro stations or on trams and buses. Sometimes tickets can be bought on the spot in trains/buses/trams. In some cities it is also possible to buy a ticket via SMS.

On-the-spot fines are imposed for failure to produce a valid ticket. If you can’t pay the fine, ticket inspectors will often call the police and you may be arrested.

### **Taxis**

For safety and economic reasons, we advise you to use major taxi companies, such as

AAA (Tel: 14014 or 222 333 222) or Profitaxi (Tel: 261 314 151).

These companies are usually able to inform you in advance of the type, number and colour of the car that will collect you.  Despite improvements in recent years, overcharging by taxi drivers remains a significant problem, especially for foreign tourists. Beware of taxis which are not properly marked and which are not at legal taxi ranks.  All taxis have meters and must use the shortest route to your destination.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in the Czech Republic, you should be careful. The number of road accidents and fatalities is relatively high compared to other EU states.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your Irish or international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* To drive on Czech motorways, vehicles must display a valid digital vignette (dálniční známka), which can be bought [**online**](https://digitale-vignette-online.cz/en) for 1 year, 30 days or 10 days.
* Keep up to date by consulting the local motoring hotline, available in Czech and English on 1230 or +420 1230. [**Basic Traffic Rules in the Czech Republic**](/690/Basic-Traffic-Rules-in-the-Czech-Republic.pdf) can be found online. (Please note this is not a legal document and provides basic tips only).

### **Vehicle Hire**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport or passport card as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. Ensure to read the small print of the vehicle hire contract and any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged.

Insurance for third-party liability is required to drive in the Czech Republic.  Please check with your insurer about the validity of your policy before travelling.
