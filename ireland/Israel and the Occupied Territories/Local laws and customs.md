## Local laws and customs

**The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against non-essential travel to Israel.** **The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), with the exception of East Jerusalem, where we advise against non-essential travel.** **The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens already present in the country.**

Please note that local laws apply as a visitor and it is the traveller’s responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local culture**

Visitors will notice a mix of religions and cultures in Israel and the oPt. Many people feel strongly about their beliefs and customs, be aware of local cultural mores at all times.

Dress modestly at pilgrimage sites and in religious areas.

Be sensitive when taking pictures of people in Muslim and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods.

Avoid taking photographs of military police personnel or installations.

Do not drive in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox areas, particularly in Jerusalem, notably Mea She'arim, on Shabbat (sunset Friday to approximately one hour after sunset on Saturday). For those observing the Jewish Sabbath, driving in their districts is prohibited under all circumstances except in instances of a life-threatening emergency.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset are forbidden for Muslims over the age of 8. Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, visitors should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year.

### **LGBT+ Travellers**

Attitudes towards LGBT+ travellers vary across Israel and the oPt.

Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults, and Israel is considered to be the most progressive country in the Middle East in this regard. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment.

Homosexuality is rejected within socially and religiously conservative spheres in both Israeli and Palestinian societies. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention in parts of the West Bank, and in more conservative Israeli areas, including ultra-Orthodox communities. Homosexuality remains largely taboo in Palestinian society.

Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT+ community, and is considered a welcoming destination for LGBT+ visitors. The annual Tel Aviv Pride, which takes place is June, attracts gatherings of hundreds of thousands each year. An annual Pride Parade also takes place in Jerusalem, however on a much smaller scale, and continues to faces strong criticism from Israel’s ultra-religious community, including violent attacks, notably the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old in 2015.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use and/or trafficking (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Personal identification**

Identification should be carried at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport) in case requested by the local authorities. It is also advisable to make photocopies of your passport in case of theft or loss.

### **Buying property/investment**

Citizens should be aware that the Irish Government, together with the majority of the international community, considers Israeli settlements in the oPt and in the occupied Golan Heights to be illegal under international law, and objects to their establishment. We therefore strongly advise against the purchase of property in such settlements.
