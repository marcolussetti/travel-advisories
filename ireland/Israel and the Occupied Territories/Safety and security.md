## Safety and security

**The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against non-essential travel to Israel.** **The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), with the exception of East Jerusalem, where we advise against non-essential travel.** **The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens already present in the country.**

If already in Israel or the oPt, you should keep up to date with local media on developments that could lead to an outbreak of regional military conflict and make your travel plans accordingly.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Carry a copy of your passport rather than the passport itself. It is also advisable to keep a physical or electronic copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) somewhere safe.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations. If travellers are victims of a crime while in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, report it to the local police immediately. Should citizens require further assistance, please [**contact**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/israel/telaviv/) the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv.

### **Driving**

Care is advised. Driving is sometimes erratic and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on Israeli roads and fines for speeding are high. If caught speeding, you may also have your licence confiscated.

* Bring an international driving licence and have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and travellers risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching when stopped at traffic lights

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise citizens not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. If planning to drive in the West Bank, please note that not all car hire companies or insurance companies cover travel into the West Bank.

Check that travellers have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Hitchhiking**

It is not safe to hitchhike.

### **Travelling to the desert**

If travelling in the desert:

* Do not travel alone
* Carry a sufficient supply of water and suncream
* It is advisable to wear a sunhat, sunglasses and light loose-fitting clothing
* Take a mobile phone
* Make sure that somebody is aware of the itinerary and expected time of return
