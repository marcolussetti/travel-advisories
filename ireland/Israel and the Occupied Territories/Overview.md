### **Travel Alert**

**Due to the emergency situation,** **the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against all travel to Israel and Palestine. Irish citizens currently in Israel or Palestine who have not already done so,** **are asked to register** **on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform** [**here**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/)**.**

The Israeli government has declared a state of emergency. Israeli airspace has been closed until further notice. Significant airport disruptions are anticipated. Please contact your airline for relevant updates prior to travel. Travellers can check on the status of flights [**here**](https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/). For the latest guidance on land crossings to Jordan, please contact the Embassy.

The security situation across both Israel and Palestine remains tense and unpredictable, with the potential for intense escalation. Please continue to exercise extreme caution, monitor local media and international regularly, follow the advice of local authorities, and observe the additional security measures imposed during this time.

There is an imminent risk of rocket fire, drone infiltration and ballistic missiles, which can occur without warning, and can disrupt civilian infrastructure, including transportation and communications. We strongly advise that citizens familiarise themselves with their closest protected location. Many buildings are fitted with “safe rooms”; reinforced spaces designed to withstand missile attacks.

Please continue to follow local guidance. Each municipality maintains a list of public shelters available, many of which are translated into English: please see relevant maps for [**Tel Aviv**](https://gisn.tel-aviv.gov.il/iview2js4/index.aspx?zoom=14000&extent=3869299,3770347,3871218,3771145&layers=592&back=0&year=2023&opacity=0.9&filters=) and [**Jerusalem**](https://www.jerusalem.muni.il/en/residents/security/shelters/). Several mobile applications, including Home Front Command and Red Alert: Israel, are available to download free of charge, and provide real-time security and safety alerts.

In the event of mortar or rocket fire, a localised “red alert” siren may be activated. In such instances, please seek shelter immediately. We advise sheltering in place for a minimum of 10 minutes after the siren ends to avoid any falling shrapnel.
