## Overview

### **Security status**

**Israel:** High Degree of Caution

**Palestine:** Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**Irish citizens currently in Israel or Palestine who have not already done so** **are asked to register** **on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform** [**here**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/)**.**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to Palestine,** **with the exception of East Jerusalem, where we advise against non-essential travel.**

**Please be advised that since 1 January 2025 those entering Israel from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL). For further guidance, and to apply, see** [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/)**.**

Irish citizens in Israel are strongly advised not to travel to border areas with Lebanon, as directed by local authorities. Further incidents can occur without notice and there is potential for intense escalation; extreme caution is advised. Travel should also be avoided north of Acre, north of Route 85. In the occupied Golan Heights, travel should be avoided north of Route 87 and within 500m of the ‘Alpha Line’ or east of Highway 98.

We strongly advise against all travel to the Gaza Strip, and to all border areas between the Gaza Strip and Israel, as directed by local authorities. Irish citizens in the Gaza Strip are advised to register their presence immediately by contacting ramallahro@dfa.ie.

Due to the volatile security situation, we currently advise against all travel to the occupied West Bank, with the exception of East Jerusalem, where we advise against non-essential travel.

The security situation across both Israel and Palestine remains tense and unpredictable, with the potential for intense escalation. Please continue to exercise caution, monitor local media regularly, follow the advice of local authorities, and observe any additional security measures imposed during this time.

There is risk of rocket fire, drone infiltration and ballistic missiles, which can occur without warning, and can disrupt civilian infrastructure, including transportation and communications. We strongly advise that citizens familiarise themselves with their closest protected location. Many buildings are fitted with “safe rooms”; reinforced spaces designed to withstand missile attacks.

Please continue to follow local guidance. Each municipality maintains a list of public shelters available, many of which are translated into English: please see relevant maps for [**Tel Aviv**](https://gisn.tel-aviv.gov.il/iview2js4/index.aspx?zoom=14000&extent=3869299,3770347,3871218,3771145&layers=592&back=0&year=2023&opacity=0.9&filters=) and [**Jerusalem**](https://www.jerusalem.muni.il/en/residents/security/shelters/). Several mobile applications, including Home Front Command and Red Alert: Israel, are available to download free of charge, and provide real-time security and safety alerts.

In the event of mortar or rocket fire, a localised “red alert” siren may be activated. In such instances, please seek shelter immediately. We advise sheltering in place for a minimum of 10 minutes after the siren ends to avoid any falling shrapnel.

### **Travel to Israel and the Occupied Territories:**

Please be aware that Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott.

For further information on entry to Israel, including information related to visa requirements, please consult the Israeli authorities.

### **General Travel Advice**

Please follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation. All demonstrations and public gatherings should be avoided.

### **Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL):**

Visitors of all ages entering Israel from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL) on arrival. For further guidance, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

ETA-IL costs 25 NIS. Approval will allow multiple entries and is valid for up to two years. Please note that obtaining a new passport, changing name, gender or country of citizenship will require new travel authorisation.

Please be aware that approval may be revoked by the Israeli authorities due to security concerns.
