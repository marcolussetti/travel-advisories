## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Cannabis is legalised for personal use, however any attempts to traffic the drug outside of Canada bring with it the possibility of stiff penalties inclusive of fines and long prison terms. Remember taking drugs will reduce your ability to make considered decisions and may make you vulnerable to accidents and unintended consequences.

### **Fentanyl**

The Government of Canada warns that Fentanyl has been detected in the illegal drug supply in all Canadian jurisdictions and significantly increases the risk of drug related overdose.
