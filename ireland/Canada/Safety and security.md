## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Canada is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Canada but you should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations.

### **Petty theft**

As with any country, crimes such as mugging, bag-snatching and pickpocketing are not uncommon in Canadian cities and towns. However, most visits to Canada are trouble-free.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Canada, report it to the local police immediately and get a police report. A police report is needed if applying for a replacement passport or making an insurance claim. If help or consular assistance is needed, please contact us at the nearest Embassy or Consulate.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Canada, be aware that cars drive on the right side of the road but otherwise road safety conditions are fairly similar to Ireland.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
