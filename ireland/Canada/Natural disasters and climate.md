## Natural disasters and climate

### **Thunderstorms**

Summer thunderstorms are fairly frequent in most parts of Canada, with some becoming severe and potentially life threatening.

### **Tornadoes**

May to September are the prime tornado months with the peak season in June and early July. Listen to local weather bulletins and check the [**National Hurricane Centre**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/), [**Environment Canada**](http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=FD9B0E51-1) and [**The Weather Network**](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/) websites. This is especially important if camping or travelling by recreational vehicle.

### **Forest fires**

Forest fires can break out at any time, regardless of the season, though they tend to be most prevalent from May-September. Please heed local warnings and monitor news bulletins for latest details on local outbreaks. For more information visit the [**Environment Canada**](http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=FD9B0E51-1) website.

### **Snow Storms**

During the winter, highways can be closed because of snow storms and avalanches. Even when roads remain open, winter driving conditions may still be treacherous. Listen to local weather bulletins and check the [**Weather Network**](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/) website. Always comply with avalanche advisories and do not enter closed trails. For more information and avalanche bulletins check the [**Canadian Avalanche Foundation**](http://www.avalanche.ca/).

### **Earthquakes**

Though rare, Canada can have earthquakes and tremors. The coast of British Columbia is the region most at risk from a major earthquake.
