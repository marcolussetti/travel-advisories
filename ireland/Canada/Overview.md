### **Travel Alert**

Wildfire season is underway in Canada, and 2025 is expected to be a particularly difficult one. Evacuation orders in response to wildfires can be expected at short notice, particularly in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba. Visitors are advised to check the status of wildfires before travelling, and to abide by all guidance provided by Provincial authorities in relation to wildfire safety.

### **General Travel Advice**

**To enter Canada, all arrivals are required to have a valid passport for the duration of their stay.**

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: REQUIREMENT FOR VISA-EXEMPT FOREIGN NATIONALS TRAVELLING TO CANADA BY AIR**

Visa-exempt foreign nationals, including passengers travelling on an Irish passport, flying to or transiting through Canada require an [**Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta-facts-en.asp)**.** Applying for an eTA is a simple, inexpensive ($7 Canadian) online process. To apply, passengers must have a valid passport, a credit card, and an e-mail address. An eTA is electronically linked to a passenger’s passport and once approved; it is valid for 5 years or until passport expiry.

Passengers who arrive at the airport without an eTA should expect to experience delays in their travels, and may not be allowed to board their flight. For this reason, passengers should apply for their eTA **before** booking their flight to Canada.

The eTA website has information about the [**eTA system and how to apply.**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/apply.html)

**Note:**

* Beware of scam websites claiming to process eTAs. The only genuine website is the one linked above.
* As eTAs are processed in a closed loop online system, the Embassy of Ireland in Canada will not be able to intervene should there be any delays or errors with your eTA application. The onus is on citizens to fill in their application correctly and to give themselves enough time to apply for the eTA in advance of travelling.

Visitors to Canada are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X @ [**@IrlEmbCanada**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbCanada) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

**Irish-Canadian dual citizens please note carefully:**

If you are a dual Irish-Canadian citizen you cannot apply for an eTA on your Irish passport and must enter Canada on [**a valid Canadian passport**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports/new-adult-passport/apply.html). You may be denied boarding if you attempt to travel using your Irish passport.

Dual citizens are strongly encouraged to [**apply for a Canadian passport.**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/passport/apply/new/index.asp) This will prevent delays during travel and help ensure dual Canadian citizens are treated according to the rules that apply to Canadian citizens.

**Note:** More information regarding travel documents for dual Canadian citizens travelling to Canada is available [**here**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/dual-canadian-citizens-visit-canada.html).

**Irish citizens who are permanent residents (PRs) of Canada please note carefully:**

Permanent residents (PRs) of Canada are **not** eligible to apply for an eTA. Canadian PRs must carry and present their valid PR card or [**Permanent Resident Travel Document (PRTD)**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/travel-document/index.asp) when boarding a flight to Canada or travelling to Canada on any other commercial carrier.

If your PR card expires, it does **not** mean you have lost permanent resident status, however it is your responsibility to apply for a new PR card when your current card expires. If you need to [**replace or renew your permanent resident card**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/pr-card/apply-how.asp), make sure to plan ahead and [**check the processing times**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/index.asp).

If you have lived outside of Canada for many years and are not sure whether you are still a Canadian permanent resident, see “[**How long must I stay in Canada to keep my permanent resident status**](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=727&top=10)” to review the residency requirement details.

### **Customs Rules**

There are strict rules in place regarding what can be taken into or out of Canada. Anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty must be declared to Customs. More information is available [**here**](https://travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada).

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Contact the emergency services in Canada by dialling 911.
