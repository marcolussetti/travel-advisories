## Safety and security

### **LGBT+ travellers**

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Hungary. Budapest is generally tolerant and open. Outside of Budapest, however, showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.

On 19 March 2025, Hungary passed legislation that could be used as a legal basis to ban future rallies and marches that depict or promote LGBT+ identities to minors. Participants in unsanctioned events could be identified by facial recognition technology and face fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian Forints. If you are planning to attend Budapest Pride, you should follow local media and the Embassy of Ireland’s social media for updates.

### **Road safety awareness**

It is important to be road safe aware, especially because things can be a bit different in a new country. Please take special care when crossing the road or driving, especially in your early weeks and months. Increased attention to road safety could save your life.

Some differences to be aware of:

* In Hungary, drivers drive on the right-hand side. You may be surprised at how often this can catch you off-guard when crossing the road. Unlike in Ireland, zebra crossings can have pedestrian lights. In this case, you must wait for a green light to cross. If the pedestrian light is red, vehicles could be driving fast towards you, even at zebra crossings. Cars can turn right onto a road even when the pedestrian light is green. There are main roads which require crossing two sets of pedestrian crossings, with an island in the middle. Just because one set of pedestrian lights is green, it does not mean both are. Always check the set of lights closest to you before crossing.

### **Driving**

* **There is 0% alcohol tolerance in operation when driving or using other vehicles. You must hold valid insurance to drive in Hungary.**
* If you are planning to drive in Hungary, be aware it is compulsory to carry your passport, international driving license and third party insurance with you when driving.

### **Vehicle hire**

* If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.
* Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Hungary is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

Hungary is maintaining a medium-level (class 3) terror alert in place in the country, although no direct threats of terrorism have been reported. You should always be aware of your surroundings, and follow any instructions from the Police (Rendőörség) or security services.

### **Crime**

Most of Hungary has a moderate rate of crime. However, you should be aware that in and around Budapest in busy tourist spots there is a much higher risk of pickpocketing and muggings. Budapest's famous ruin bars are particularly popular with tourists. The months of May – September are especially busy with inter-railing and other travelers. There have been reports of petty crime and intimidation from some bar staff. We advise you to be vigilant and stick with a group where possible.

We recommend the following basic precautions:

* Keep your passport in a secure and safe place while travelling. Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* There have been reports of drinks being spiked, especially in bars in Budapest. Buy your own drinks and do not let them out of your sight.
* There have been reports of short term rental accommodation being burgled, with burglars seeming to have key access to the property. Before booking, try to ensure your accommodation has a range of legitimate reviews.
* Use official ATMs or banks. Use ATMs inside banks if possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in busy areas.
* Be vigilant about petty crime: many of the cases we encounter involve stolen passports or wallets.
* Always use a registered taxi provider. All taxis in Budapest are yellow and the cars will have a company logo/sticker on the door. Where possible call a taxi rather than hailing one on the street. Confirm the destination with the driver and be careful when paying as Hungarian notes come in a range of denominations.
* Don't carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place. Do not store all information on your mobile only but send copies to your email (also to a next of kin) to have access in case your mobile was lost or stolen.

### **Reporting crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Hungary, report it to the local police immediately. The number for emergency services is 112. Ask a Hungarian to assist you if you are having language difficulties with the operator. At the police station, you can request an interpreter to make a police report in English. Always ask for a copy of this report and keep it. You can also contact us at the Irish Embassy in Budapest if you need help.
