### **Vaccinations**

Irish citizens do not require vaccinations when travelling to Hungary. However, you should seek medical advice about inoculations to prevent tick-related medical problems (such as tick-borne encephalitis), particularly if you expect to be visiting lakes or wooded areas.

### **English Speaking Professionals**

You may need to contact an English-speaking lawyer or doctor during your time in Hungary. For your convenience the Embassy has drawn up a list of English speaking professionals, which you may find useful. Inclusion on these lists should not be taken as a recommendation by the Embassy.
