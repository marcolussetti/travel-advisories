## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Public Transport**

You must validate printed, single-journey tickets before you go down to the metro or on to the suburban train. On trams, trolleys, buses it must be validated right after you get on the vehicle. Alternatively use the Budapest Go application and buy single tickets online before you get on the vehicle. The mobile phone should read the QR code of the vehicle before you get on. The code is beside the doors outside the vehicle. It is not possible to activate the code once you got on the vehicle. **If you do not validate tickets, you could receive a fine from an inspector, which can be an uncomfortable experience.**
