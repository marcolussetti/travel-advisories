## Health

### **Medical Facilities**

Hospital treatment in large cities in South Africa is good but can be expensive. Medical facilities in rural areas can be basic. In remote areas, air evacuation is sometimes the only option for medical emergencies.

### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We can’t advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **HIV and Aids**

The level of HIV and AIDS infection in South Africa is very high. You should exercise necessary caution if engaging in activities that expose you to possible infection. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, you should seek immediate medical attention.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is prevalent in parts of Mpumalanga, Limpopo province and KwaZulu-Natal (particularly the Wetlands area around St Lucia). Before travelling to these areas, including Kruger Park, you should seek medical advice on suitable anti-malarial medication and take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

### **Cholera**

There are periodic outbreaks of cholera in rural South Africa, especially in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo provinces. You’re advised to maintain a high level of personal hygiene and drink only bottled water if travelling in these areas.

### **Yellow Fever**

Anyone arriving in South Africa from a country where yellow fewer is present must have a yellow fever vaccination certificate valid at least six days before entry into South Africa. If you don’t have this certificate on arrival in South Africa you could be refused entry or vaccinated at the airport and quarantined for up to six days.
