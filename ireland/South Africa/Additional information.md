## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

If your visit to South Africa is for less than 90 days, you won't need a visa. You are strongly advised not to overstay the 90 day limit as the South African Department of Home Affairs has in place strict rules and penalties in respect of visitors who overstay without permission.

A valid passport is required for travel to South Africa and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from your intended date of departure from South Africa.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to South Africa and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Pretoria**](/en/southafrica/pretoria/). We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.

### **Travelling with Children**

Additional documentation is required for travellers accompanied by children, and for unaccompanied children travelling to and from South Africa.  For full details of the requirements for travellers entering or leaving South Africa with children, read the [**advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs**](http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/statements-speeches/621-updated-advisory-new-requirements-for-children-travelling-through-south-african-ports-of-entry).  If you have queries or concerns regarding these requirements we recommend that you consult with the [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of South Africa in your country of residence, or with the South African authorities if you are resident in South Africa.

### **Money**

The currency in South Africa is the rand. Exchange control regulations mean that it’s difficult to buy foreign currency without going through lengthy and elaborate procedures.

There is a high incidence of credit card fraud and fraud involving ATMs. As at home in Ireland, when you’re using an ATM, be careful to ensure your PIN number can’t be observed by others when you’re withdrawing money. Offers of help from bystanders should be refused. Don’t change large sums of money in busy public areas.

### **Climate**

South Africa has a subtropical climate and warm temperatures for much of the year. The Western Cape gets most of its rainfall in winter, but the rest of the country is generally a summer-rainfall region.

South Africa’s seasons are opposite to those in Europe.
