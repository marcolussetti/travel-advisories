#### **Flooding in Kruger National Park and surrounding areas (Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces)**

Kruger National Park and the surrounding areas are currently experiencing severe disruption caused by heavy rainfall and flooding. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a Red Level 10 weather [alert](https://www.weathersa.co.za/home/warnings), warning of severe impact on roads and settlements and danger to life from rising rivers, and fast-flowing and deep water. SAWS warns large communities may be inaccessible/cut-off for a prolonged period. Flights to and from Hoedspruit Airport have resumed having been suspended, but are subject to local weather conditions.

Parts of Kruger National Park have been closed and evacuated, while South African National Parks (SAN Parks) has [announced](https://www.sanparks.org/news/update-on-severe-weather-warning-day-visitors-into-the-kruger-national-park-temporarily-suspended) that day visitors will not be allowed into Kruger National Park until conditions improve. SAWS’ forecasts report heavy rainfall is likely to continue for the coming days.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises that visitors monitor local media for updates, check with your travel or accommodation provider about your options, and reconsider traveling if necessary. Plan your route in advance and ensure routes are safe and accessible. Be aware roads may close at short notice and never drive on a road covered by water. Follow guidance from local authorities and SAN Parks.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens who are planning to visit South Africa for less than 90 days, do not require a visa. If you wish to visit for longer than 90 days please consult your nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of South Africa before travelling.

A valid passport is required for travel to South Africa and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from your intended date of departure from South Africa. Passport cards cannot be used. Your passport must have at least two blank pages and must not be damaged in any way. If your passport fails on either count, it will be not be accepted by the South African authorities.

If you are a South African citizen aged 18 or over, you must use a South African passport to enter and exit South Africa. It is illegal to use another country’s passport. See the [**South African Department of Home Affairs**](https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/travel-documents) for further information. In terms of section 26(B) of the South African Citizenship Act, 1995, it is a punishable offence for a South African citizen (including dual nationals) of 18 years and older to leave or enter South Africa on a foreign passport.

There is a very high level of crime, including violent crime, in South Africa. The most violent crimes tend to occur away from the normal tourist destinations, but you should take sensible precautions to protect your safety. Crime increases in areas where large crowds gather, so be particularly vigilant if you're attending sporting or other events that attract large numbers. (See Safety and Security)

There are strict documentation requirements in place for people travelling with children to/from and through South Africa. For more information on these important requirements, please view the Entry Requirements tab.

Visitors to South Africa are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.
