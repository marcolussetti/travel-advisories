## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

The penalties for both the supply and possession of drugs are severe in South Africa and can include life imprisonment.

### **Prostitution**

Prostitution is illegal in South Africa. The risk of HIV and AIDS infection in South Africa is very high. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, you should seek immediate medical attention.

### **Money**

The currency in South Africa is the rand. Exchange control regulations mean that it’s difficult to buy foreign currency without going through lengthy and elaborate procedures.

There is a high incidence of credit card fraud and fraud involving ATMs. As at home in Ireland, when you’re using an ATM, be careful to ensure your PIN number can’t be observed by others when you’re withdrawing money. Offers of help from bystanders should be refused. Don’t change large sums of money in busy public areas.
