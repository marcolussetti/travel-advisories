## Safety and security

### **Political Unrest**

The political situation in South Africa is reasonably stable but dangerous incidents can happen. Always keep yourself informed of what's going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser and avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

### **Protests and Demonstrations**

In South Africa, there are frequent protest marches, strike-related demonstrations, and occasional incidents of public disorder that have the potential to escalate into violence. These protests, marches, and demonstrations can happen unexpectedly throughout the country. It is advisable to steer clear of areas where such events are taking place, particularly in city centres and townships

Stay informed by monitoring local news and social media for updates, and consider utilizing GPS to identify alternative routes if there are roadblocks or protests in your vicinity, as these events can change direction rapidly.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in South Africa has generally been classified as low, in  July 2018, police  investigated a series of incendiary devices placed at different locations in the Durban area. Two of these devices were triggered, causing small fires. You should exercise usual caution if you encounter unexpected devices or packages. If in doubt, contact the police

### **Crime**

South Africa has a high level of crime, including violent crime, rape and murder. While most cases occur in townships or in areas away from normal tourist destinations, nowhere is completely safe and you should exercise caution when travelling in both urban and rural environments, including city centre areas at night (city centres are usually referred to as Central Business Districts or CBDs in South Africa). Take basic safety precautions:

* Don't carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don't carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don't use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Don't change large sums of money in busy public areas and don't give personal or financial account information details to people you don't know
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations. Be vigilant when passing through South Africa's airports; pickpockets and thieves patrol them
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible. Walking at night is not advisable and many tourists consider public transport to be unsafe; private car rental is the safest option for independent travel
* Use only recognised hire car companies or official taxis. If you book a taxi or car to meet you at the airport, ask in advance for the driver's name for confirmation

### **Table Mountain National Park, Lion’s Head and Signal Hill**

There has been a spate of violent assaults and muggings on hikers and tourists in Table Mountain National Park, including on Lion’s Head and Signal Hill. Take care in quieter isolated areas of the park, especially during early mornings and evenings. Stick to busy marked trails on popular days such as weekends, and do not hike alone.

### **Kruger National Park**

South Africa National Parks (SANParks) advise against using the Numbi gate entrance to Kruger National Park. There have been a number of violent incidents involving tourists on the R538 road leading to the gate.

Follow SANParks advice on using alternative entrances. If you stay outside the park, contact your lodge in advance to find out if any disruptions will affect your trip. Get up-to-date [**SANParks news**](https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/) on the park website.

### **Car Crime**

Armed car-jacking is a serious concern throughout South Africa. Thefts and smash-and-grab robberies from vehicles are common. You should keep the doors locked and windows closed, and exercise caution when travelling, particularly at night and at filling stations.

If mugged or your car is hijacked you should remain calm, offer no resistance and hand over possessions without question. Avoid eye contact.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in South Africa, report it to the local police immediately on 10111 (112 from mobile phones). And you can [**contact us at the Irish Embassy in Pretoria**](/en/southafrica/pretoria/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in South Africa are broadly similar to those in Ireland. Roads are generally good, but some roads in the more remote areas are poor. The standard of driving in South Africa can vary greatly and there are many fatal accidents every year.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance. An Irish licence will be valid for up to 12 months after entry, provided it carries the photograph and signature of the holder
* Drive cautiously at all times and adhere to South Africa's traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Avoid 'road rage' situations as they can quickly escalate and turn violent
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Wear your seatbelts at all times
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you're stopped at traffic lights
* Four-way-stops are common at quieter intersections – the first vehicle to arrive has priority. Roundabouts (circles in SA) should be treated with caution. Traffic lights are known as robots in South Africa
* Park in well-lit areas. Don't pick up strangers. Don't stop to help (apparently) distressed motorists, as this is a technique sometimes used by hijackers. It is better to report the incident to the police
* Avoid using ATMs in garages and in poorly lit areas. Be vigilant of anyone trying to help at an ATM
* Never leave bags, suitcases, or items of value on display in your car – these should be locked away in the boot
* Avoid isolated beaches and picnic spots across South Africa and stay in company. Walking alone anywhere, especially in remote areas, is not advised and hikers should stick to popular trails. Call the police on 10111 (112 from mobile phones) at the first sign of a threat.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you're allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

If renting a car, save the emergency roadside assistance numbers. Download an offline map if you do not have access to a GPS.

When travelling to and from Cape Town International airport, you should stick to the M3 and N2 where possible, and avoid the R300 and the R310 between Muizenberg and the N2 intersection. There have been a number of incidents involving car jackings of tourists in rental cars on these routes of late.

### **Volunteering**

While it may be possible to volunteer in or visit orphanages in South Africa, this can have serious consequences for children. Growing evidence globally demonstrates the links between institutions and trafficking, with volunteer visits helping to sustain an ‘orphanage industry’, increasing the risk of exposure to abuse and exploitation.

Comhlámh’s [**Code of Good Practice**](https://comhlamh.org/code-of-good-practice/) is a set of standards for Irish Volunteer Sending Agencies (VSAs). VSAs commit to child-safe volunteering, ensuring that no programmes or activities involve the sending of volunteers to orphanages, with one exception - the sending of skilled and vetted volunteers in support of de-institutionalisation.

When volunteering abroad, you should follow the same advice as any traveller. You may need a work visa, health vaccinations, or minimum passport validity. Travel insurance is still considered essential. Even though you may stay in a single location, you should ensure that your family or friends at home have a copy of your itinerary and your travel documents. You should also attempt to maintain contact with relative frequency.

You can register your travel plans with the Department through the [**Citizens Registration facility**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/)**.**

As many volunteering experiences involve spending time in rural areas, consider basic language training and familiarise yourself with local customs. This may help you to find useful information and improve your immersion experience.
