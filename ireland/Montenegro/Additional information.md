## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visas**

Irish passport holders don’t need a visa to enter Montenegro for stays of up to 90 days. If you want to stay beyond 90 days, you must apply for a long stay visa (D) or a temporary residence permit no later than one week before the 90-day period is over. For more information [**visit the Montenegro’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website**](http://www.mvp.gov.me/en/sections/consular-affairs/visa-regimes-for-citizens-of-Montenegro/).

### **Passports**

Your passport should be undamaged and valid for the proposed duration of your stay.

### **Border crossings**

Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings. If you’re planning a mountaineering tour that involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.

On entering Montenegro, make sure that you get an entry stamp in your passport from the border police. If you try to leave Montenegro without an entry stamp, you may face charges of illegal immigration, a heavy fine and possible imprisonment.

### **Registration**

You must register with the local police within 24 hours of your arrival, unless you’re staying in a hotel or official tourist accommodation, in which case you will be registered automatically on checking-in. If you don’t register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance. You may also face difficulties leaving the country.

If the company or person you’re visiting is providing private accommodation for longer than 24 hours, they must submit an application for your residence to the police within 12 hours of your arrival and cancel it within 12 hours of departure.

If you’re registering at a police station, you’ll need to bring a registration card with you, which can be bought at any bookstore. In some places, you may be able to register at tourist travel agencies or at local tourism organisations, depending on the agreements in place with the police. You may also be asked to pay small residence tax.

### **Diseases**

These diseases may be a risk in all or part of the country: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, tick-borne encephalitis.

### **Money**

The official currency of Montenegro is the Euro. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country. Northern Irish bank notes are not accepted.

### **Customs requirements**

Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare any sums in excess of €2,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €2,000 out of the country, you’ll need to provide proof that you brought the money in. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also get a document stating the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.

To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment. It’s a legal requirement to declare all credit cards when entering or exiting Montenegro. Failure to do so may result in a fine.

Customs officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you’ll need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs.
