## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

There are no laws against homosexuality in Montenegro and same-sex couples are generally tolerated. However, we do advise discretion and it may be best to avoid public displays of affection.

### **Photography**

Avoid taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles as this may lead to difficulties with the authorities.

### **Money**

The official currency of Montenegro is the Euro. Credit cards are widely accepted throughout the country. Northern Irish bank notes are not accepted.

### **Western Union Money Transfer**

### **Customs Requirements**

Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare any sums in excess of €2,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €2,000 out of the country, you’ll need to provide proof that you brought the money in. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also get a document stating the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.

To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment. It’s a legal requirement to declare all credit cards when entering or exiting Montenegro. Failure to do so may result in a fine.

Customs officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you’ll need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs.
