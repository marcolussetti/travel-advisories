## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

There are no laws against homosexuality in Montenegro and same-sex couples are generally tolerated. However, we do advise discretion and it may be best to avoid public displays of affection.

### **Photography**

Avoid taking photographs of military and police installations, personnel or vehicles as this may lead to difficulties with the authorities.
