## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although most visits to Montenegro are trouble-free, there is an underlying threat from terrorism, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime levels are low, but street crime take place, particularly in larger towns so take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Watch out for pick pockets in public places like airports and on public transport

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Montenegro, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Budapest**](/en/hungary/budapest/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Montenegro, you should be extremely careful. Poor road conditions and poor standards of driving in Montenegro results in an above-average number of road accidents. One particularly poor road is the Ibarska Magistrala (linking Serbia to Montenegro): bad conditions and overcrowding can make it dangerous. Traffic drives on the right.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Drive defensively, avoid confrontation with other drivers and avoid driving at night outside urban areas
* Keep your dipped headlights on during the day

### **Car Documentation**

If you’re taking your car to Montenegro, bring your vehicle registration/ownership documents and a locally-valid insurance policy.  Drivers of cars registered on foreign plates and without suitable valid insurance will be asked to buy insurance at the border crossing. The European green card is valid in Montenegro.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Mountain Climbing**

The mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe, averaging more than 2,000 meters in elevation. Take special precautions and a mountain guide to avoid accidents in the mountains.  If you’re planning a mountaineering tour that involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
