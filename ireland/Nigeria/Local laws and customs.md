## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Nigeria is a federal republic divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory. The Federal Government exercises jurisdiction throughout the country on certain issues while State Governments exercises jurisdiction on other issues. The Nigerian Police Force is a federal, national police force. In recent years, some southern states have set up official law enforcement bodies but they are not officially recognised by the Federal Government.

Conditions in Nigerian prisons and detention facilities fall below the standards that would be observed in Ireland and can be extremely unpleasant.

The public display of a same sex relationship is illegal under federal law. Prosecutions can result in custodial sentences of up to 14 years imprisonment.

Drug related offences in Nigeria can attract heavy prison sentences.

Taking photographs of government buildings is illegal and can lead to detention.

It is illegal to export African artefacts and antiques from Nigeria without written authorisation from the Department of Antiquities.

Nigeria formally retains the death penalty for a number of offences.

### **Sharia Law**

A number of northern Nigerian states which are predominantly Muslim have adopted Sharia Law. These are: Zamfara, Sokoto, Kano, Niger, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Kebbi and Yobe. Sharia Law is an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties for Muslims convicted under Sharia Law in northern Nigeria can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. Where travellers have essential business in these states, they should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, head and arms. Nigeria is a deeply religious society and travellers to all parts of Nigeria should respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities.
