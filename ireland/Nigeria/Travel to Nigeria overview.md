### **Security Advice:**

All citizens present in Nigeria are encouraged to [**register their presence**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy.

The security situation remains uncertain in many parts of Nigeria and there is a high threat of domestic terrorism. Be aware that there is an ongoing threat from the Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) insurgencies, which has caused substantial loss of life over the last decade.

Rallies, protests, demonstrations, and riots are common and may occur at any time. The security forces may use tear gas and/or live ammunition for crowd control. Keep up to date with local and international events and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately and monitor local media for up-to-date information.

There is a high risk of kidnapping throughout Nigeria. We advise to take security precautions along the lines mentioned further below. In addition, when arranging appointments in Nigeria, ensure that the attendees are known to you and that the meeting is held in a secure location. Many kidnappings in Nigeria are commercial in nature, are often opportunistic, and can happen in any part of the country. There have been recent terrorist kidnappings, and while these have occurred mainly in northern Nigeria previously, they could also occur elsewhere. Terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWAP are likely to carry out kidnappings, and several foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been targeted previously. Banditry and outbreaks of inter-communal violence have occurred frequently throughout Nigeria, and particularly in the North West and North Central in recent years.

The Middle Belt states often experience outbreaks of localised violence, linked to civil unrest, farmer-herder disputes and elections, and such outbreaks can occur at short notice. Such occurrences can often be quickly followed by localised curfews imposed by the authorities. Visitors are advised to avoid large crowds, political rallies, demonstrations and any large public protests or gatherings.

In the event that you encounter difficulties in the areas where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against all or all but essential travel to, the assistance that the Department of Foreign Affairs or our Embassy in Abuja may be able to provide, is likely to be extremely limited. Before considering travel to these areas, we advise you to take professional security advice.

For all other areas, we advise you to take additional security precautions. These might include:

* having the name and phone number of the driver collecting you at the airport;
* being wary of any last-minute driver changes;
* planning in advance how you are getting to and back from each meeting;
* considering a security escort if travelling in rural areas or at night-time;
* varying your routines;
* keeping others informed of your travel plans;
* following the security advice of your employer;
* staying only in secure accommodation;
* reviewing your security measures regularly.

Travellers to Nigeria should bear these factors in mind and pay careful attention to local news prior to and during travel to/in Nigeria. Visit the ‘Safety and Security’ tab for more information.
