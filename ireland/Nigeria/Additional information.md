## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Nigeria. Visa application form can be found [**here**](https://portal.immigration.gov.ng/visa/freshvisa).

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Nigeria and have at least two blank pages.

### **Currency**

Nigeria is a largely cash based economy. There is limited acceptance of credit cards and debit cards in major cities and rare acceptance in the rest of the country. The security of ATMs in Nigeria cannot be guaranteed.

Visitors will be unable to obtain the local currency (Nigerian naira) until they have arrived in Nigeria. The largest denomination is the 1,000 naira note (about €2.50). Notes have been widely circulated and are often in very poor condition. Make regular use of hand sanitisers when handling cash to avoid illness.

Travellers should bring sufficient cash to cover expenses while in Nigeria. There are restrictions on the quantity of cash that can be brought into the country, and travellers should verify the latest requirements with their local Nigerian Embassy/Consulate/High Commission before travelling. Airlines will normally give a customs declaration form and an immigration arrival form before you land. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency but Euros can also be exchanged locally.

### **Natural disasters and climate**

Nigeria's climate is tropical, varying from the humid beaches in the south to the hot desert in the north. Temperatures can vary from 21°C to 44°C. Elevated areas of the country such as the Jos plateau are cooler and wetter. Given the high temperatures, travellers in Nigeria frequently become dehydrated and we advise that travellers maintain a supply of drinking water.
