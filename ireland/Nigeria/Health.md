## Health

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly recommends obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation, before travelling to Nigeria. Check any exclusions, and that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake. Travellers should note that the Irish Government does not provide funds for emergency medical repatriation or for repatriation of remains.

In most parts of Nigeria, medical facilities are very basic and even in major population centres the level of available medical care is quite limited, and payment must usually be made up-front. Accordingly, medical evacuation to Europe or South Africa is frequently required for anything more than a minor accident or illness.

We advise travellers to Nigeria to consult a GP and take medical advice before travelling. Medical practitioners advise travellers to receive a large number of vaccinations which would not normally be required in Ireland. A **Yellow Fever** vaccination and a valid WHO approved Yellow Vaccination Book are required for entry to Nigeria â€“ travellers who are unable to provide evidence of Yellow Fever vaccination are liable to deportation by the Nigerian Immigration Service.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a major public health problem in Nigeria, and can be fatal without medical attention. Consult a GP about malaria prophylaxis prior to travel. The use of anti-insect spray/cream and/or insecticide treated mosquito nets can also reduce the risk of contracting malaria.

### **HIV/AIDS**

HIV/AIDS is prevalent and travellers should exercise appropriate precautions.

### **Polio**

Polio is no longer endemic in Nigeria, but is not yet considered eradicated. There are regular outbreaks of cholera, measles, lassa fever, and meningitis throughout the country.

Nigeria experiences heavy rainfall during the rainy season (June - September), during which time there is an increased risk of water-borne diseases like cholera, and flash flooding can occur. Maintain a supply of clean bottled water at all times and to avoid purchasing sachets of water on the street.

### **Zika**

There is currently no known outbreak of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Nigeria. However, there have been cases in the recent past and it is present in the wider region. For this reason Irish Citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/) (HPSC).
