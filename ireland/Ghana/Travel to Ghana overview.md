High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens are advised to follow developments in the region in respect of m-pox, and to consult advice available such as on the [**HSE website**](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mpox/).

We advise visitors to avoid all political gatherings as these can be flashpoints for civil unrest. Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

Irish citizens need a visa to travel to Ghana. It is not possible to receive a visa at the border and must arrange for this prior to travel. Citizens should apply for visa no more than 45 days before their trip. Further information on how to apply for a visa can be obtained from the [**Ghana High Commission**](https://www.ghanahighcommissionuk.com/) in London.

Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Ghana and have at least 3 blank pages. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Ghana by dialling 112.
