## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

We advise visitors to avoid attending all political gatherings as these can be flashpoints for civil unrest.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Arising from a heightened threat of terrorism in West Africa and worldwide, there is a risk of terrorism in Ghana. Indiscriminate terrorist attacks could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates such as hotels, beaches, churches or other areas where people gather.

### **Crime**

Most visits to Ghana are trouble-free. However, there are incidents of crime, particularly in and around Accra and the other main urban areas and particularly after dark. Therefore take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and be careful using ATMs, particularly after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Ghana, report it to the local police immediately. Citizens can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Abuja if help is needed.

### **Fraud**

Some Irish citizens have been victims of fraud in Ghana. If a friend you have met online starts to ask you to transfer money to them or you receive an unsolicited email with a business offer, an offer to purchase commodities, or any other proposal which promises quick financial reward, please be vigilant about the potential for scams. Contact the Embassy of Ireland in Abuja, Nigeria for an assessment of the credibility of the offer before you commit any resources to any offer.

### **Driving**

The inter-city road network in Ghana is in good condition by regional standards, but falls short of the standards available in Ireland. However, visitors should be extremely careful particularly in rural areas, as most roads are in a poor condition. Road travel can be extremely hazardous due to poor or non-existent street lighting. If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and an international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* Visitors are advised to avoid travelling by road outside the main towns after dark, when the risk of accidents and robbery is greater.

### **Public transport**

Safety standards on buses and taxis are often low.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security.

If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Swimming**

Wave and tide patterns are often dangerous, and swimming from beaches can be hazardous. Visitors should only do so on local advice.

### **Water sports**

If taking part in extreme adventure sports (white water rafting, kayaking, bungee jumping, etc.), make sure that these activities are covered by your insurance. Visitors should be aware that many of these adventure sports operators are unregulated, and so take care that you choose reputable tour operators.
