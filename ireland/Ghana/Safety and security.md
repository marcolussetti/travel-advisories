## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There's a heightened risk of terrorist attacks in the northern areas of Ghana bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Togo and Burkina Faso. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places, and follow the advice of local authorities. Indiscriminate terrorist attacks could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates such as hotels, beaches, churches or other areas where people gather.

Local police may impose curfews to contain the situation. The authorities may put out a press release which is usually posted on the [Ministry of the Interior’s website](https://www.mint.gov.gh/category/press-release/).

### **Social Unrest**

We advise visitors to avoid attending all political gatherings as these can be flashpoints for civil unrest.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Crime**

Crime has steadily increased in the recent years in Ghana, especially in large cities such as Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi and their surroundings. Therefore take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and be careful using ATMs, particularly after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible. (Not sure how to mover the Bullet points across)

Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Fraud**

Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards or when making payments at a payment terminal, be vigilant about the potential for scams.

### **Driving**

Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. They are generally good in cities, but poor in rural areas. Most secondary roads are poorly lit. Pedestrians and roaming livestock pose further hazard, especially at night. If driving in Ghana:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and an international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors and windows locked and bags kept out of sight.
* Visitors are advised to avoid travelling by road outside the main towns after dark.
* In the case that you are involved in a road traffic accident, report it to the nearest police station immediately.

### **Public Transport**

Public transport is limited in Ghana. Safety and maintenance standards can be unreliable.

Many buses and taxis are not well-maintained and have poor safety standards.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security.

If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Swimming**

Wave and tide patterns are often dangerous, and swimming from beaches can be hazardous. Visitors should only do so on local advice.

### **Water Sports**

If taking part in extreme adventure sports (white water rafting, kayaking, bungee jumping, etc.), make sure that these activities are covered by your insurance. Visitors should be aware that many of these adventure sports operators are unregulated, and so take care that you choose reputable tour operators.
