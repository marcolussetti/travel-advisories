## Local Laws and Customs

### **Local Culture**

Ghana is a conservative and religious country and visitors should use common sense and respect local sensitivities. Beachwear should be confined to the beach, and wearing immodest clothing in public is likely to cause offence or attract unwanted attention.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBTIQ+**

Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. LGBTIQ+ relationships and identities are largely regarded as socially unacceptable.

Violence, threats, extortion, eviction and arbitrary arrest of LGBTIQ + people occur, and the debate around an anti-LGBTIQ+ bill has increased these risks to the LGBTIQ+ community.

LGBTIQ+ travellers are advised to consider travel plans and personal security carefully. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Photography near government buildings, military installations and airports is prohibited as is photography of military and law enforcement personnel.
