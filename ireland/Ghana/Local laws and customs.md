## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Local culture**

Ghana is a conservative and religious country and visitors should use common sense and respect local sensitivities. Beachwear should be confined to the beach, and wearing immodest clothing in public is likely to cause offence or attract unwanted attention.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality in Ghana is illegal and can incur a penalty of up to seven years in prison.

Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Photography near government buildings, military installations and airports is prohibited as is photography of military and law enforcement personnel.
