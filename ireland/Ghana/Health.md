## Health

Check with a GP a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Ghana are required. The standard of medical care available in Ghana is good by regional standards but not as high as the standard available in Ireland. Serious accidents or illnesses may require medical evacuation to Europe.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is endemic in Ghana and can be fatal without medical attention. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether anti-malarial medication is needed. Avoid mosquito bites by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Yellow fever**

A yellow fever vaccination and a valid WHO-approved Yellow Vaccination Book are required for entry to Ghana â€“ if visitors cannot provide evidence of yellow fever vaccination, they may be deported.

HIV and AIDS are prevalent in Ghana. If engaging in activities that expose you to possible HIV infection, make sure to take adequate precautions. If you suspect that you have been exposed, seek immediate medical attention.
