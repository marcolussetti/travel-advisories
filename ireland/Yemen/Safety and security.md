## Safety and security

On-going hostilities in the region have negatively impacted Yemen’s social and political stability and have increased the possibility for wider conflict within Yemen.

Northern Yemen has been hit by intense air strikes by a number of actors in recent months. Travelling to this region may be extremely dangerous and all travel should be avoided. Areas under control by the Internationally Recognised Government have not been subject to aerial bombardment but remain volatile and there is a constant risk of civil disorder, terrorism and kidnapping. Travel in these areas is also not advised.

### **Violent unrest**

The political situation in Yemen is extremely unstable and continues to deteriorate.  Violent clashes are being witnessed.  If you are in Yemen, we advise you to leave immediately.  Always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

The threat from terrorism in Yemen is high, and there is an extreme risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks.

### **Kidnapping**

Foreign nationals are potential targets for kidnapping so you should take particular care when travelling in Yemen:

* Get advice from your local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Yemen, you should be extremely careful. Road safety standards are low, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by poor driving, badly maintained vehicles and inadequate lighting.

If you want to drive:

* Check with the authorities to find out what documentation you need
* Bring your international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
