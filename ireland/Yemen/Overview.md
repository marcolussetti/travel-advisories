### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Yemen at this time due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Yemen.

A valid passport is required for travel to Yemen. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visa and passport requirements, please contact the [**Yemeni Embassy in London**](https://www.yemenembassy.co.uk/).

Visitors to Yemen are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Riyadh on Twitter [**@IrishEmbRiyadh**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbRiyadh) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
