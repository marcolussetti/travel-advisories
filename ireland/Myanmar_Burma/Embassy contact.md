## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Myanmar/Burma, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Thailand.

After business hours, Irish Citizens seeking emergency consular assistance should contact the Duty Officer number at +662-016-1360.

Please leave a message with your name, contact number and details of the emergency.
