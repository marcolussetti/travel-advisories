There are reports of significant military movements in several regions of the country. Conflict can escalate quickly. Citizens should continue to monitor local media closely.

Explosions and attacks are occurring regularly in Yangon and other parts of the country.

The military regularly shuts down access to various internet platforms and reports of disruptions to wider internet, phone networks and ATMs are frequent and widespread across the country.
