## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military detained officials from the elected government and announced a state of emergency, effectively seizing control of the country’s governance. This situation still persists with conflict for territorial control between the military and other armed group.

The political situation is volatile and you may find your security unexpectedly at risk. Due to high levels of political tension, acts of politically motivated violence may occur at any time. Avoid concentrations of police and security forces and remain informed of current issues.

Restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, religion, and political activity remain, and under current laws criticism of the government can result in imprisonment, detainment and deportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.

Irish citizens in Myanmar should exercise caution and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. Avoid taking pictures of demonstrations, police or military, including any police stations or military installations, as this may be prohibited by the authorities.

Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts which predate the 2021 coup and involve a large number of Ethnic Armed Organisations from Myanmar’s border areas.

### **Landmines**

Landmines pose a threat in conflict areas so exercise extreme caution if travelling in these areas. Do not stray off main routes, particularly in rural areas, and always check with your local contact before travelling to affected regions.

### **Crime**

Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from crime while in Myanmar:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Be aware of your surroundings and have situational awareness at all times.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Myanmar, be extremely careful. Road safety is poor and traffic is heavy and chaotic in urban areas. Poor road conditions, poorly maintained vehicles, and inadequate street lighting can make driving dangerous. Potholes, pedestrians, animals, abandoned vehicles, and vehicles travelling and parked at night without lights also pose risks.

If you want to drive, bring a full Irish and an international drivers licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Vehicle Hiring**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
