## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes**

Myanmar can experience extreme weather conditions and earthquakes. A strong 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck northeast India near the border with Myanmar and Bangladesh, on 4 January, 2016. A 6.8 Magnitude struck in the Bagan region in August 2016 and 4.7 most recently on the border with China in April 2017. If travelling to or living in Myanmar, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Cyclones**

Myanmar is prone to cyclones, which can be devastating in their strength. Myanmar's rainy season generally runs from the end of April to October, during which time cyclones may be frequent. Monitor local and international weather updates during your stay, particularly if planning to travel throughout the country and always follow local authorities' instructions about security and evacuation. Be aware that certain areas or roads, including major roads between towns, may become impassable due to localised flooding in this period.
