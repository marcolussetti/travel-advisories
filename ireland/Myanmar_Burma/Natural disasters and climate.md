## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes**

Myanmar is an earthquake zone and can experience extreme weather conditions and earthquakes. A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on 28 March 2025, resulting in many fatalities. There continues to be ongoing seismic activity in the region. If travelling to or living in Myanmar, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Cyclones**

Myanmar is prone to cyclones, which can be devastating in their strength. Myanmar's rainy season generally runs from the end of April to October, during which time cyclones may be frequent. Monitor local and international weather updates during your stay, particularly if planning to travel throughout the country and always follow local authorities' instructions about security and evacuation. Be aware that certain areas or roads, including major roads between towns, may become impassable due to localised flooding in this period.
