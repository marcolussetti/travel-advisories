## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, ranging from a minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment. Do not use, share or distribute drugs.

### **Local Culture**

Myanmar is a majority Buddhist country and Myanmar people take religion very seriously. There have been recent cases of foreign tourists being arrested for being disrespectful of religious practices, so we advise visitors to be cautious and sensible. Respect religious custom when visiting Buddhist religious sites â€“ shorts, short skirts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. Shoes and socks should be removed before entering a pagoda or monastery. Using the image of the Buddha for decoration, including tattoos, is considered very offensive.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, although these laws are rarely enforced in practice.
