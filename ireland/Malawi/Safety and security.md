## Safety and security

### **Current issues**

Caution should be exercised in all areas, especially after dark. When visiting rural areas it is advisable to check on the general safety of the area, or for any recent incidents, with contacts in the community in advance.

### **Social unrest**

Always be aware of your surroundings, pay attention to local media and be careful around large groups of people in major urban areas. Avoid rallies, demonstrations and public gatherings. If in an area where you believe your safety is threatened, leave immediately.

Photography of government buildings, airports, bridges, churches, and military installations is strictly prohibited.

### **Crime**

Most visits to Malawi are trouble-free, but be alert to muggers and bag-snatchers and take sensible precautions. Be alert to petty theft and pickpockets around the main bus stations in Lilongwe and Blantyre, and at the main ports for the Ilala ferry. If the victim of a mugging, offer no resistance and hand over your possessions without question.

Residential break-ins, organised robberies and car-jackings are known to occur and may target foreigners. Authorities have reported break-ins in Lilongwe, especially in neighbourhoods where many foreigners may stay. Extra care should be taken to ensure your accommodation is secure.

Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or accommodation entrance as possible.

### **Reporting a crime**

Report any crime to the police immediately. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime are solely the responsibility of local authorities, our consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and find a lawyer, if needed.

The emergency number in Malawi is 999 (or 01 757 999, or 01 751 444).

### **Lost or stolen passport**

Lost or stolen passports are sometimes handed to the police within a few days. Report the loss to the nearest police station as soon as possible, and keep in touch with that station in case of recovery. If your passport is stolen, apply to the Embassy for a replacement.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Malawi, be extremely careful. The traffic-related death rate is high. Poor road conditions, poorly maintained vehicles, and inadequate street lighting can make driving dangerous. Potholes, pedestrians, animals, abandoned vehicles, and vehicles travelling at night without lights also pose risks. Driving outside cities after dark is not recommended; be aware that emergency roadside assistance is very limited. Traffic in Malawi drives on the left.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Carry your driving licence at all times while driving, you may be required to produce it at police checkpoints.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. The Malawi Police Service carry out breathalyser tests.
* It is illegal to talk on a mobile phone while driving.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Never leave personal belongings in a vehicle.
* Be aware that petrol stations are found only in larger towns and plan your route accordingly. Most petrol stations do not accept credit or debit cards but it is possible to purchase and top up a fuel card (using cash) which will then be accepted as payment for fuel.

### **Traffic offences**

If caught drink driving or speeding your licence and/or vehicle can be confiscated on the spot. It will only be returned after an appearance before a magistrate. Convicted drivers face a fine and/or imprisonment. The blood alcohol limit is 0.08g per 100ml of blood.

Drive slowly in all built-up areas. Traffic police often place speed cameras in built-up areas where there are no signs showing the speed limit (which is 50kmph). For such traffic offences, the police impose on-the-spot fines.

### **Car-jacking**

There have been instances of armed car-jackings, particularly of four-wheel-drive vehicles. These can happen when a vehicle is stopped, for example, while waiting to enter at a compound vehicle gate, at intersections, or in traffic. Car doors should be locked and windows closed, especially when stopping your vehicle. Do not resist if threatened by car-jackers.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public transport**

Long-distance coach services are available to travel between the major cities of Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Blantyre and international bus services also operate to Tanzania and South Africa.

Public transport is extremely limited in rural areas. We advise against travel by minibus because the vehicles are overcrowded and poorly maintained. We also advise against hitchhiking, including taking informal lifts in the back of open vehicles. Fatal accidents are frequent and emergency services are basic where they exist.
