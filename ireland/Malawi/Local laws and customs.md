## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Culture**

As in many African countries, Malawian culture is generally conservative and respectful of elders. Use common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour - outside the main tourist areas, women should cover their legs and shoulders. Respect religious beliefs and social conventions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

### **Legal proceedings**

Visitors are subject to local laws while in Malawi and a serious violation may lead to a jail or death sentence.

If arrested or detained you have the right to contact the Irish Embassy. Arresting officials have a responsibility to help you do this. Our consular officials can provide a list of local lawyers upon request.

Legal proceedings or police investigations may be different from the Irish legal system. Expect to face long delays and difficulties in order to resolve your case. We cannot intervene in ongoing legal proceedings in other countries or regions, unless requested to do so by local authorities. Such requests are rare.

### **Prohibited materials**

It is forbidden to import ivory, drugs, and pornographic material into Malawi, and it is illegal to buy or export uncut precious stones. Wildlife crime (including export of protected species) carries severe penalties, including prison sentences of up to 15 years.

### **LBGTI+**

Homosexual activity is illegal, although the law is rarely enforced. Local attitudes towards LGBTI+ people are generally negative.

### **Illegal drugs**

Drug use, including use of cannabis, is illegal and punishment can be severe. Undercover police officers have been known to operate at popular resorts and tourists have been arrested on drug charges.

### **Photography**

Photography of government buildings, airports, bridges, churches, and military installations is strictly prohibited. Also be aware that it may be offensive to photograph people without their consent. We recommend that you get permission before taking photographs of people or their property.

### **Wildlife**

Hippos and crocodiles are common in many of Malawi's lakes and rivers, including areas of Lake Malawi. Be aware of risks associated with viewing wildlife (both marine and on land), particularly on foot or at close range.

If visiting Malawi's national parks, wildlife reserves, lakes or rivers, keep a safe distance and avoid leaving the vehicle unless a professional guide or warden advises it is safe to do so. Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators and follow park regulations and wardens' advice closely.

### **Water safety**

Swimming, wading or bathing in fresh water is not recommended because of the threat of disease, mainly Bilharzia. However, if swimming get local advice on conditions. Areas of Lake Malawi can develop strong currents and the lake can become quite rough without warning. Also, as a freshwater lake, buoyancy is much less than that of sea water and you will tire more quickly. In some areas, the lake becomes deep very close to shore, so be careful when swimming, especially with young children.

### **Dogs**

Avoid contact with dogs. Dogs can carry disease (including rabies) and are often kept as guard dogs, as opposed to pets, and can be aggressive. It is advisable to get a rabies vaccine before coming to Malawi, particularly if you intend to visit rural or lakeshore areas.
