## Entry requirements

### **Passport**

Irish passports should be valid for a minimum period of six months on arrival in Malawi.

### Visa

As of January 2026, Irish passport holders must apply for a visa to enter Malawi. You are advised to apply as early as possible in advance before you travel through the Malawi Immigration [**website**](https://evisa.gov.mw/). The costs for the visas are below:

50 US dollars for a single-entry visa

150 US dollars for a 6-month multiple entry visa, and

250 US dollars for a one-year multiple entry visa

You are advised to bring US dollars in cash for payment on arrival, if your e-visa has not been issued in time for travel. Please note that the embassy is aware of individuals without an e-visa being denied boarding to travel to Malawi.

### **Extending an Entry Permit**

If you wish to extend your stay, the 30-day permit can be extended twice, up to an additional 30 days on each renewal, before it expires (90 days in total). Renewals can be granted at the immigration offices in Lilongwe or in Blantyre.  
You must submit a permit-extension application before your permit expires but be aware that there is no guarantee the request will be granted.  
Further information is available from the [**Department of Immigration.**](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/)

### **Purpose of Visit**

If volunteering, studying or conducting research or business for more than 90 days in Malawi, you are responsible for requesting the correct type of visa/permit from the [**Malawi High Commission in London**](http://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/) or through the online system [**https://epermit.gov.mw/**](https://epermit.gov.mw/) before traveling to Malawi.  
There is no guarantee that requests for changing an immigration category (e.g. from visitor permit or tourist visa to temporary employment permit) will be granted.

### **Religious Visitors**

If the main reason for visiting is to take part in religious activities (voluntary or paid) you should get a temporary employment permit, rather than a visitor's permit, through your sponsoring organisation or business. Foreign nationals who entered Malawi with a tourist visa or on a visitor's permit and then carried out activities inconsistent with their tourist status, such as business or volunteer services have been deported in the past.  
The [**Malawi High Commission in London**](http://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/) can advise on other types of entry requirement and the procedure for longer stays.

### **Travelling with Children via South Africa**

Additional documentation is required for travellers accompanied by children, and for unaccompanied children travelling via South Africa.  For full details, read the [**advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs**](http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/statements-speeches/621-updated-advisory-new-requirements-for-children-travelling-through-south-african-ports-of-entry).  If you have queries or concerns regarding these requirements we recommend that you consult with the [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of South Africa.
