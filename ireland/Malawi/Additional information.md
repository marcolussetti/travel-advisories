## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (passport/visa)**

Irish passports should be valid for a minimum period of six months on arrival in Malawi.

Irish citizens do not require a visa in order to enter Malawi. Irish citizens may enter Malawi for an initial 30 days, if they receive "Entry Authorisation" at the port of entry. This is free of charge.

### **Extending an entry permit**

If you wish to extend your stay, the 30-day permit can be extended twice, up to an additional 30 days on each renewal, before it expires (90 days in total). Renewals can be granted at the immigration offices in Lilongwe or in Blantyre.  
You must submit a permit-extension application before your permit expires but be aware that there is no guarantee the request will be granted.  
Further information is available from the [**Department of Immigration.**](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/)

### **Purpose of visit**

If volunteering, studying or conducting research or business for more than 90 days in Malawi, you are responsible for requesting the correct type of visa/permit from the [**Malawi High Commission in London**](http://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/) or through the online system [**https://epermit.gov.mw/**](https://epermit.gov.mw/) before traveling to Malawi.  
There is no guarantee that requests for changing an immigration category (e.g. from visitor permit or tourist visa to temporary employment permit) will be granted.

### **Religious visitors**

If the main reason for visiting is to take part in religious activities (voluntary or paid) you should get a temporary employment permit, rather than a visitor's permit, through your sponsoring organisation or business. Foreign nationals who entered Malawi with a tourist visa or on a visitor's permit and then carried out activities inconsistent with their tourist status, such as business or volunteer services have been deported in the past.  
The [**Malawi High Commission in London**](http://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/) can advise on other types of entry requirement and the procedure for longer stays.

### **Travelling with Children via South Africa**

Additional documentation is required for travellers accompanied by children, and for unaccompanied children travelling via South Africa.  For full details, read the [**advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs**](http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/statements-speeches/621-updated-advisory-new-requirements-for-children-travelling-through-south-african-ports-of-entry).  If you have queries or concerns regarding these requirements we recommend that you consult with the [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of South Africa.

### **Money**

There are strict rules about taking foreign currency and Malawian Kwacha out of the country.  
It is not permitted to take more than USD$2,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) out of Malawi, unless you declared the amount on arrival in the country or you have Malawian bank approval certifying the purchase of the foreign currency.

Credit cards are not widely accepted in Malawi, particularly outside urban centres and it is advised to use cash instead. Money can be changed at the airports, banks or commercial bureaux de change.  
Most ATMs will accept international Visa cards, but there are very few ATMs outside of the main urban centres and ATMs are frequently out of order. Fewer ATMs accept Mastercard. There is normally a charge of approximately €2 per transaction. It is also possible to draw cash on a foreign credit or debit card at major bank branches.  
US Dollars are accepted by many lodges, national parks and upmarket hotels. Check in advance if your accommodation will accept foreign currency.
