## Travel to Malawi overview

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Elections were held in Malawi on 16 September. There is a likelihood of increased political events, including celebrations and demonstrations, over the coming days as the results are announced. Avoid rallies, demonstrations and public gatherings. If in an area where you believe your safety is threatened, leave immediately.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter  Malawi. However, Irish passport holders still need to apply for “Entry Authorisation” at the port of entry, at no cost. This authorisation must be renewed after 30 days, for a maximum of 90 days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Malawi. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Malawi are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@IrlEmbMalawi**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbMalawi/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
