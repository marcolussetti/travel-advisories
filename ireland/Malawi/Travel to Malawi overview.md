## Travel to Malawi overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

The economic situation in Malawi is deteriorating, and social unrest is on the rise. A number of protests have turned violent in Lilongwe and Blantyre over the course of February and March 2025. These protests are localised and the sporadic violence has been targeting specific businesses. However, there is a risk that demonstrations will grow or turn more violent without warning. Tear gas may be used to disburse crowds. Visitors are advised to avoid demonstrations, large crowds or any political rallies.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter  Malawi. However, Irish passport holders still need to apply for “Entry Authorisation” at the port of entry, at no cost. This authorisation must be renewed after 30 days, for a maximum of 90 days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Malawi. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Malawi are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@IrlEmbMalawi**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbMalawi/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
