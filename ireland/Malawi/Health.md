## Health

Citizens planning travel to Malawi should obtain medical advice and make sure to have all appropriate vaccinations. If taking regular medication, bring enough for the duration of your stay. We also advise to carry a doctor's note or a pharmacy receipt with your prescription drugs.

Malaria is endemic to Malawi. Travellers should discuss appropriate precautions with a healthcare professional before travelling.

### **Vaccination certificate**

A yellow fever vaccination certification is required from travellers over one year of age arriving from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission and travellers having transited more than twelve hours through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission.

Although Malawi is not regarded as a yellow fever country, Ethiopia is. Many Irish citizens travelling to Malawi do so via Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines. If, while transferring through Addis you have left the airport and spent more than twelve hours in country, for example by overnighting, before your onward flight it is possible that immigration officials in Malawi will ask for proof that you have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Failure to have proof of such a vaccination may cause problems at immigration in Malawi. Citizens travelling via this route are recommended to have proof of a yellow fever vaccination.

For reference, please see the [**World Health Organisation's list of countries with a risk of Yellow Fever transmission**](http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_Annex_I.pdf?ua=1).

### **Medical facilities**

Healthcare standards, particularly in rural areas, tend to be poor. Minor injuries and ailments can be dealt with at private clinics found in the larger towns, while only Lilongwe and Blantyre have (limited) facilities to treat more complex cases. The Embassy of Ireland in Malawi can provide a list of healthcare providers in these cities if required.

If a medical emergency arises, we advise that the patient be medically evacuated (usually to South Africa) as soon as they are stable. Make sure that you have adequate health/travel insurance before travelling to Malawi, including for medical evacuation, which can cost tens of thousands of euros for an uninsured patient.

### **Malaria and insect-borne disease**

Malaria is endemic to Malawi. Before travelling, ask your doctor about suitable anti-malarial medication. Upon arrival, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers in the evening.

If you become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while travelling in a malaria-risk area, or up to a year after returning home, get medical attention immediately and tell the doctor your travel history and what anti-malarial medications you have been taking.

Kasungu National Park is home to tsetse flies, which can carry sleeping sickness.

### **Schistosomiasis (bilharzia)**

Schistosomiasis is present in most lakes and rivers in Malawi, including Lake Malawi. The disease is caused by a tropical flatworm that is found in water and is parasitic in humans. We advise against swimming, wading or bathing in fresh water.

### **HIV and AIDS**

Malawi has a high HIV and AIDS infection rate. Take appropriate precautions to limit the risk of transmission through blood or sexual contact.

### **Gastric illness**

Outbreaks of gastric intestinal infections and cholera can happen, especially during the rainy season (November to April).

Citizens should be aware there was a significant outbreak of cholera in Malawi which began in rural areas in 2022 but spread to large urban centres across the country. The outbreak resulted in approximately 2,000 deaths, and while it has been contained, citizens are advised to follow local government health advice while in Malawi.

Along with outbreaks of cholera, diarrhoea and other food-borne illnesses can be a problem among travellers. Citizens are advised to avoid tap water, ice cubes, and raw fruits and vegetables while in Malawi, and bottled water is recommended for drinking and food preparation. Heightened awareness of hygiene is also advised.

### **Rabies**

Rabies is endemic in all areas of Malawi; avoid contact with dogs. Dogs are usually kept for security rather than as pets and they can be aggressive. Consider getting a rabies vaccine before coming to Malawi, especially if planning to travel to rural areas.

### **Rain and flooding**

The rainy season extends from November to April. Secondary roads may be impassable to all but four-wheel-drive vehicles during this period. Roads and bridges can be washed away by flash floods, particularly in lakeshore areas. Stay informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.

### **Earthquake**

Malawi is located in a seismic zone and earthquakes do occasionally happen – notably in the northern region (Karonga District).

Earthquakes may cause landslides in affected areas. Strong aftershocks are possible up to a week after the initial quake.
