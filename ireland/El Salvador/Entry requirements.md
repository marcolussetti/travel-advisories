## Entry requirements

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter El Salvador, and may stay for up to 90 days. Entry to the country is at the discretion of the immigration officer, and visitors should be prepared to share information on travel plans, funds, etc. to immigration officers.

Passports should be valid for six months from the date of entry into El Salvador.

El Salvador is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.
