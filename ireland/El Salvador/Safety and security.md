## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

Presidential Elections will take place on Saturday, 4 February 2024. Visitors to the country should monitor local news in the run up to the election, in case there are demonstrations.

The El Salvador Constitution prohibits political activities by foreign nationals, and participation in demonstrations may result in detention and/or deportation. Visitors should avoid large gatherings or demonstrations and exercise caution in public areas.

### **Crime**

Until 2022, El Salvador had one of the highest crime rates in Latin America, but since then the homicide rate has reduced significantly. The incidence of other forms of violent crime, once common, has also decreased. The risk of petty and opportunistic crime remains.

Most visits to El Salvador are uneventful, but violent crime, including robberies and assaults, may still occur. Sexual and gender-based violence also remains an issue. Visitors should take personal security seriously, be aware of surroundings at all times, and avoid obvious displays of wealth.

On 27 March 2022, a nationwide state of emergency was declared by the government in response to a surge in gang-related violence and homicides. The state of emergency has been extended several times since then, and remains in place. The state of emergency places restrictions on gatherings, allows arrests without a warrant, and the monitoring of communications, among other measures. Irish citizens in El Salvador should monitor local media to stay informed, and follow the instructions of local authorities. A heightened security presence is to be expected, and Irish citizens should avoid security operations, which continue to take place across the country, particularly in urban areas, including in San Salvador.

Visitors to the country should exercise caution:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Leave a copy of your passport (travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

It is safer to withdraw money from ATMs in shopping centres or change money in hotels or banks and it is wise not to withdraw too much money at any one time. Visitors should not resist if they are the victim of a robbery or attack.

Pay attention to security in the border areas with Guatemala and Honduras. Visitors should use the officially recognised border crossings.

### **Kidnapping**

Foreign nationals can be kidnapping targets either for political or financial reasons. If planning to visit the country, follow these basic precautions:

* Get advice from local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Landmines**

Unexploded ordnance such as landmines is a danger in the El Salvador countryside, a legacy of past conflicts. Always keep to main routes, take local advice and avoid travel to such areas if advised to do so.

### **Local travel**

Try to avoid travelling anywhere in El Salvador at night and avoid travelling alone. Take particular care if you need to go to downtown San Salvador, other towns or cities, or travel on roads outside of major towns and cities after dark. Where possible, travel as part of a group and with a reputable travel company. Avoid travelling on public buses.

There have been instances of armed attacks on vehicles travelling throughout El Salvador and attacks have taken place on the road between El Salvador and Guatemala. Avoid travelling on unpaved roads as there is a greater risk of attack in remote areas with fewer police patrols.

### **Taxis**

For shorter trips within towns and cities it is safer to take radio or hotel taxis rather than public buses or unofficial taxis.

### **Lost or stolen passports**

If passports are lost or stolen, getting a replacement can take up to two weeks so keep your travel documents secure at all times. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if citizens are able to provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Reporting crime**

If citizens are a victim of a crime while in El Salvador, report it to the local police immediately. Contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Mexico City**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/) if help is required.

### **Driving**

If you are planning to drive in El Salvador, be extremely careful as road conditions vary and driving standards are low. If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and there is a risk of being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Take particular care when travelling to/from the border with Guatemala. There have been reports of violent attacks on vehicles.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Swimming**

Swimming on El Salvador's Pacific coast can be dangerous due to strong undertows. The currents around La Bocana de San Diego are particularly dangerous and several people have drowned in recent years. The number of lifeguards is limited and you should avoid swimming on isolated beaches.

### **Hurricane season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. Close attention should be paid to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

### **Volcanoes**

El Salvador has several active volcanoes. Seek local advice before climbing any volcanoes in El Salvador, preferably during daylight hours or with a tour guide. Monitor local media for any updates on increased volcanic activity. Visitors can find volcano warnings on the website of the [**Directorate General of Civil Protection**](http://www.proteccioncivil.gob.sv/) (in Spanish).

### **Earthquakes**

El Salvador is subject to frequent minor earth tremors and occasional earthquakes. Local information can be found (in Spanish) on the [**MARN website**](http://www.marn.gob.sv/) or their Twitter feed [**@MedioAmbienteSV**](https://twitter.com/medioambientesv?lang=en)
