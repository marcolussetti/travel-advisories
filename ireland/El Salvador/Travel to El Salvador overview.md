High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter El Salvador. Visitors should note that El Salvador is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.

A valid passport is required for travel to El Salvador. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Until 2022, El Salvador had one of the highest crime rates in Latin America, but the security situation has improved significantly since then, with the homicide rate falling to less than 2 per 100,000, a figure lower than any other country in Central America. Reports indicate that the incidence of most other forms of violent crime has also reduced, but that sexual and gender based violence remains a concern. As is the case in other countries, there is a risk of petty and opportunistic crime.

On 27 March 2022, a nationwide state of emergency was declared by the government in response to a surge in gang-related violence and homicides. The state of emergency has been extended several times since then, and remains in place. The state of emergency places restrictions on gatherings, allows arrests without a warrant, and the monitoring of communications, among other measures. Irish citizens in El Salvador should monitor local media to stay informed and follow the instructions of local authorities. For more information, please consult our safety and security section.
