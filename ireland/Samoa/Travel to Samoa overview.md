Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Samoa.

A valid passport is required for travel to Samoa. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months after intended date of departure. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Samoa are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in New Zealand on social media (X [**@IrelandinNZ**](https://twitter.com/IrelandinNZ) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassynewzealand/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.
