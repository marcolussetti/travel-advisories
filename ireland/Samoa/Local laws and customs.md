## Local laws and customs

### **Petty Crime**

Crime in Samoa is low but petty crime does occur.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Samoa:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Demonstrations**

Public gatherings and demonstrations may take place from time to time.

We recommend that you stay clear of demonstrations, and should follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **Nature and Climate**

### **Earthquakes and volcanoes**

Samoa is located in a seismically active zone, which can lead to earthquakes, volcanic activity and tsunamis.

### **Tropical storms and Cyclones**

In Samoa, strong winds can be expected from the beginning of November to the end of April, some of which can reach cyclone strength. During this time, intense rainfall and subsequent floods and landslides are to be expected.

The climate is tropical. The rainy season extends from November to April and the hot and dry seasons occurs from May to October

You are advised to monitor local and international weather updates from [**World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)**](http://severe.worldweather.org/), the [**Samoa Meteorology Division website**](http://www.samet.gov.ws/) or the [**Fiji Meteorological Service website**](http://www.met.gov.fj/).

### **Swimming**

Tide changes can produce powerful currents in ocean lagoons. Take local advice before swimming. Fatal accidents have occurred at popular beaches.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Samoan law criminalizes homosexuality and homosexual relations. If you are convicted, you could face imprisonment, though enforcement of the law is rare.

### **Road travel**

Samoa switched to driving on the left in 2009, however, many vehicles still have the steering wheel on the left of the vehicle. You should take care when driving on the roads, observing speed limits.

You should avoid driving at night out of built-up areas. Vehicle safety regulations are not consistently enforced and traffic violations occur routinely.
