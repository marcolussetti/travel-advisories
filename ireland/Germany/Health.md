### **European Health Insurance Card**

Make sure to obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before you travel to Germany. This card entitles you to emergency medical treatment on the same terms as German nationals. The EHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance and does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Please [**apply online**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/).

### **Prescriptions**

Possessing a medicine without the relevant prescription is legal, provided the medicine in question does not contain substances prohibited under the German Narcotics Act.

### **Travel Insurance**

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure the policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

The Embassy cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Citizens should be aware that in the case of a sudden death in Germany, processes and procedures to conduct an autopsy and obtain relevant documentation, such as a death certificate, can take significantly longer than in Ireland. The repatriation of remains from Germany to Ireland also requires more time than from other European countries. The appointed undertaker in Germany can advise on precise timelines, generally this process may take from two weeks to ten weeks approximately.

Policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you are sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Medical emergency**

To locate the nearest clinic operating an emergency service, contact the 24-hour hotline of the German Doctors’ Association on 116 117. An emergency pharmacy service (“Notapotheken”) also operates throughout Germany. The emergency pharmacy in any area changes every day. Enter your German postal code at the website of the [**German Association of Pharmacists**](http://www.aponet.de/service/notdienstapotheke-finden.html) to locate the nearest pharmacy offering an emergency service that evening. The website of the Embassy of Ireland in Berlin contains a list of [**English speaking medical facilities.**](https://www.ireland.ie/693/Updated-2016-English-speaking-doctors-Germany.pdf)

### **Long term stays**

Health insurance is a legal requirement if you intend to reside in Germany. An EHIC card is not sufficient for longer stays as it does not cover routine care.
