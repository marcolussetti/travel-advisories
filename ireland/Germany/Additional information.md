## Additional information

### **Driving**

Drivers must be over 18 in Germany. Drive on the right hand side of the road and always carry your driver’s licence, insurance and vehicle documents, as well as written permission from the registered owner if the vehicle does not belong to you. In the event of a road accident, dial 110 for emergency services.

Traffic can be faster-paced than in Ireland, especially on the motorways (Autobahn), and traffic laws, speed limits and driving customs are different.

Inner city areas of certain German cities are designated as environmental inner city zones (Umweltzone) into which only vehicles bearing a low emissions’ sticker may enter. The website of the [**Environmental Protection Agency**](http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/air/particulate-matter-pm10/low-emission-zones-in-germany) (Umwelt Bundesamt) has information in English.

There have been a small number of reports of scams on motorways in northern Germany in which individuals claiming to be Irish have stopped motorists, said they were involved in an accident and asked to “borrow” money. If stopped by someone claiming to have been in an accident, contact the police on 112 with your location and a description of the individuals seeking assistance and their car registration number. Do not hand over money.

### **Lost licence**

The Embassy has no involvement in driving licences. Please contact the [**National Driver Licence Service**](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply.html) in Ireland in case of a lost driver’s license. If your licence is subsequently handed into the Embassy, the Embassy will return it to the NDLS.

### **Car hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise against giving your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times. Ensure adequate insurance is in place and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged). The Embassy cannot provide legal advice in the event of disputes, but can provide a list of English-speaking lawyers and consumer rights organisations.

### **Public transport**

German public transport is generally barrier-free, meaning that passengers are trusted to have the correct ticket and must produce it immediately if asked to do so by a ticket inspector. Ticket inspectors are often dressed in plain clothes and will not make an exception for non-German speakers. There are fines for travelling without a valid ticket, so ensure you have purchased the correct ticket for your needs and validated the ticket, if required. The Embassy cannot assist with disputes over fines, but can provide a list of English-speaking lawyers should you wish to pursue the matter privately.

### **Jaywalking**

It is illegal to cross German pedestrian crossings when the red pedestrian light is on. Offenders risk a fine and payment of all costs in the event of an accident. While the Embassy cannot provide legal advice if you wish to challenge any fine, we can send you a list of English-speaking lawyers should you wish to pursue the matter privately.
