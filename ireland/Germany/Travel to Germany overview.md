#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Berlin for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

There is no change to entry requirements for German passport holders travelling directly to Ireland without transiting through the UK.

### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Germany.

Travellers may be subjected to checks at German borders or points of entry from its Schengen neighbours. Such controls have been in place since September 2024 and are scheduled to remain until at least March 2026. Further extensions or amendments are possible.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Germany.

Visitors to Germany are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. While in Germany, you must carry photo ID with you at all times.
