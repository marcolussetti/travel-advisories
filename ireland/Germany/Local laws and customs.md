## Local laws and customs

### **Border Controls**

Travellers may be subjected to checks at German borders or points of entry from its Schengen neighbours. Such controls have been in place since September 2024 and are scheduled to remain until at least September 2025. Further extensions or amendments are possible.

### **Personal identification**

* German police have the right to ask individuals for identification at any time. If you do not have your passport, the police may escort you to wherever your passport is so that they can see it.
* We strongly recommend to apply for a Passport Card before you visit. A Passport Card costs â‚¬35, fits neatly into a wallet and can be used as ID and for travel within the EU/EEA and Switzerland. It is available to Irish citizens, aged 18 and over, who hold a valid Irish passport with at least 6 months remaining validity. We also recommend keeping a photocopy of your passport in a separate place so you can prove your identity if your passport is lost.
* Digital file-sharing and downloading outside of paid services is illegal and enforced in Germany. Substantial fines can be imposed on anyone caught downloading or sharing files illegally.
* It is against the law to operate a bicycle or scooter while under the influence of alcohol and this is regularly enforced, with substantial fines for violations.
