## Local laws and customs

Please note that local laws apply as a visitor and it is the traveler's responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behavior may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Please follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation. All demonstrations and public gatherings should be avoided.

### **Local culture**

Visitors will notice a mix of religions and cultures in Israel. Many people feel strongly about their beliefs and customs. Be aware of local cultural mores at all times.

* Dress modestly at pilgrimage sites and in religious areas.
* Be sensitive when taking pictures of people in Muslim and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods.
* Do not take photographs of military police personnel or installations.
* Do not drive in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox areas, on Shabbat (sunset Friday to approximately one hour after sunset on Saturday).
* During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset are forbidden for Muslims over the age of 8. As a courtesy, visitors should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year.

### **LGBT+ Travellers**

Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT+ community, and is considered a welcoming destination for LGBT+ visitors.

Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults.

Attitudes towards LGBT+ travellers vary across Israel and homosexuality is rejected within some socially and religiously conservative spheres in Israel.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use and/or trafficking (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Personal identification**

Identification should be carried at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport) in case requested by the local authorities. It is also advisable to make photocopies of your passport in case of theft or loss.

### **Buying property/investment**

Citizens should be aware that the Irish Government, together with the majority of the international community, considers Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and in the occupied Golan Heights to be illegal under international law, and objects to their establishment. We therefore strongly advise against the purchase of property in such settlements.
