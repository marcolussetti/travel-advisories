## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Israel continues to face a risk of terror attacks. Visitors are advised to stay aware of their surroundings, particularly in busy public places, tourist sites, religious locations and near police checkpoints, as a routine precaution.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low but take sensible precautions:

Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.

Carry a copy of your passport rather than the passport itself. It is also advisable to keep a physical or electronic copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) somewhere safe.

Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations. If travellers are victims of a crime while in Israel, report it to the local police immediately. The phone number for the Israeli police is 100.

Should citizens require further assistance, please contact the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv.

### **Driving**

Care is advised. Driving is sometimes erratic and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on Israeli roads and fines for speeding are high. If caught speeding, you may also have your licence confiscated.

Bring an international driving licence and have adequate and appropriate insurance

Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and travellers risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise citizens not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. Please note that not all car hire companies or insurance companies cover travel into the West Bank, Palestine.

Check that travellers have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
