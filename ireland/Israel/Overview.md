## Overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises Irish citizens against all travel to Israel.**

**Given the recent attack on Iran, Irish citizens are advised against all travel to Israel. Citizens currently in Israel should shelter in place, minimise unnecessary movement, and follow the advice and guidance of local authorities. Stay away from all military facilities.**

**Irish citizens currently in Israel in need of consular assistance can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Israel on +972 36964166. If you have not already done so you are asked to register on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform** [**here**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/)**.**

There is a risk of rocket fire, drone infiltration, ballistic missiles, etc., which can occur without warning, and can disrupt civilian infrastructure, including transportation and communications. We strongly advise that citizens familiarise themselves with their closest protected location. Many buildings are fitted with a “safe room”, reinforced spaces designed to withstand missile attacks.

In the event of mortar or rocket fire, a localised “red alert” siren may be activated. In such instances, please seek shelter immediately. We advise sheltering in place for a minimum of 10 minutes after the siren ends to avoid any falling shrapnel.

Please follow local guidance. Each municipality maintains a list of public shelters available, many of which are translated into English; please see relevant maps for Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Several mobile applications, including Home Front Command and Red Alert: Israel, are available to download free of charge, and provide real-time security and safety alerts.

Israel continues to face a risk of terror attacks. Visitors are advised to stay aware of their surroundings, particularly in busy public places, tourist sites, religious locations and near police checkpoints, as a routine precaution.

For the latest updates please follow the [**X**](https://x.com/EmbassyTLV) account of the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv.

### **Travel to Israel**

Please be aware that Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott.

For further information on entry to Israel, including information related to visa requirements, please consult the Israeli authorities.

### **Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL):**

Visitors of all ages entering Israel from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL) on arrival. For further guidance, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

ETA-IL costs 25 NIS. Approval will allow multiple entries and is valid for up to two years. Please note that obtaining a new passport, changing name, gender or country of citizenship will require new travel authorisation.

Please be aware that approval may be revoked by the Israeli authorities due to security concerns.
