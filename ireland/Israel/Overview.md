Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises Irish citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Israel**.

Irish citizens are advised to avoid non-essential travel to Israel. If you are in Israel, you should consider whether your continued stay is essential and keep your travel plans under close review. If you have not already done so you are asked to register on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform [**here**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/).

The security situation in the Middle East remains unpredictable, with regional tensions high and an ongoing risk of military escalation. Developments in the region could lead to increased tensions in Israel and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.

Given ongoing regional tensions, airlines may choose to suspend flights and/or adjust their schedules to and from Israel and the wider region at short notice. If you are flying in or out of the region in the coming days, please check your flight status with your airline directly in advance of travelling.

**Irish citizens in Israel are strongly advised not to travel to border areas with Lebanon.**

**Irish citizens in Israel are strongly advised not to travel to border areas with Syria.**

**We advise against all non-essential travel to all border areas between the Gaza Strip and Israel.**

The security situation across Israel is tense and unpredictable, with the potential for escalation. Please continue to exercise caution, monitor local media regularly, follow the advice of local authorities, and observe any additional security measures imposed during this time.

There is a risk of rocket fire, drone infiltration, ballistic missiles, etc., which can occur without warning, and can disrupt civilian infrastructure, including transportation and communications. We strongly advise that citizens familiarise themselves with their closest protected location. Many buildings are fitted with a “safe room”, reinforced spaces designed to withstand missile attacks.

In the event of mortar or rocket fire, a localised “red alert” siren may be activated. In such instances, please seek shelter immediately. We advise sheltering in place for a minimum of 10 minutes after the siren ends to avoid any falling shrapnel.

Please follow local guidance. Each municipality maintains a list of public shelters available, many of which are translated into English; please see relevant maps for Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Several mobile applications, including Home Front Command and Red Alert: Israel, are available to download free of charge, and provide real-time security and safety alerts.

Israel continues to face a risk of terror attacks. Visitors are advised to stay aware of their surroundings, particularly in busy public places, tourist sites, religious locations and near police checkpoints, as a routine precaution.

Please be advised that those entering Israel from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL). For further guidance, and to apply, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

### **Travel to Israel**

Please be aware that Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott.

For further information on entry to Israel, including information related to visa requirements, please consult the Israeli authorities.

### **Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL):**

Visitors of all ages entering Israel from visa-exempt countries (including Ireland) must be in possession of a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation to Israel (ETA-IL) on arrival. For further guidance, see [**https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/**](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

ETA-IL costs 25 NIS. Approval will allow multiple entries and is valid for up to two years. Please note that obtaining a new passport, changing name, gender or country of citizenship will require new travel authorisation.

Please be aware that approval may be revoked by the Israeli authorities due to security concerns.
