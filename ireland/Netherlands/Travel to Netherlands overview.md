Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

The Netherlands will host the upcoming 2025 NATO Summit on 24 and 25 June at the World Forum in The Hague. It requires many security measures, which will affect road traffic, public transportation and air travel between Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam.

Further information on road and transporation diversions associated with the NATO Summit can be found [**here**](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-foreign-affairs/activiteiten/nato-summit-2025/nato-summit-2025-accessibility).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter the Netherlands.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter the Netherlands. However, if staying for longer than three months, EU citizens are advised to register their presence in the local Personal Records Database (BRP). Your municipality can provide you with more information on registering. More information on the process can be found [**here**](https://ind.nl/en/residence-permits/eu-eea-or-swiss-citizens/registering-with-the-ind-as-an-eu-eea-or-swiss-citizen).

Visitors to the Netherlands are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (@IrelandinNL on [**X**](https://twitter.com/IrelandinNL), [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/irelandinnl/) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandInNL/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Temporary Reintroduction of Land Border Controls**

The Royal Netherlands Marechaussee has implemented temporary border controls at its internal boders with Belgium and Germany for 6 months (from 9 December 2024 to 8 June 2025).
