## Safety and security

### **Schiphol (Amsterdam) Airport**

Passengers arriving at Schiphol (Amsterdam) Airport by car or train may experience additional security checks. Please allow an extra half an hour of travel time.

### **Terrorism**

The current [**Netherlands Terrorism Threat level**](https://english.nctv.nl/topics/terrorist-threat-assessment-netherlands) (as set by the NCTV / National Coordinator for Threat Assessment) remains substantial at 4 on a scale of 5 after a number of recent incidents. This indicates that there is a real chance of a terrorist attack in the country, but that the authorities have no concrete indications that one is being planned. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. Visitors should be vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.

In December 2019, the Dutch Government amended its national terrorism threat level from ‘substantial’ to ‘significant’. This is the [**third of five levels**](https://english.nctv.nl/topics/terrorist-threat-assessment-netherlands) and means that an attack is ‘conceivable’. Visitors should remain vigilant in public places and report any suspicious activity to police.

### **Public transport**

Public transport is efficient and relatively inexpensive. Visitors can usually pay the driver in cash, however, a travel card (the OVChipkaart) is the cheapest option and can be purchased at any train station. Remember to tag on and off when boarding and leaving the train, tram or bus. Live travel information for all trains, trams and buses is available on [**www.9292.nl**](http://www.9292.nl/)

Security personnel regularly inspect tickets and failure to pay your fare may result in a large fine or arrest.

Keep luggage with you as theft of unattended bags is not unusual.

### **Bicycles and mopeds**

Cycling is one of the most popular forms of transport in the Netherlands. In both urban and rural areas there is an extensive network of dedicated lanes (often paved with red tiles), next to the footpaths, for bicycles and mopeds. Do not walk in the cycle lanes.

Bicycles and mopeds are frequently allowed to travel in either direction on one-way roads, and are given priority at many junctions. Take care when crossing roads and watch out for all forms of traffic – trams, bicycles, cars and mopeds – and, when driving, watch out for cyclists.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in The Netherlands are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained. The Dutch drive on the right and give priority to the right, unless otherwise indicated. Be particularly careful when using roundabouts: as some have the right of way when on them but on others right of way must be given to vehicles entering.

If visitors want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Take extra care with bicycle traffic which generally has priority (see above).
* Be aware of The Netherlands’ traffic laws, such as speed limits. Speed cameras, speed traps and unmarked vehicles are widely used. Motorway speed limits are 120kph, except where lower limits are posted. City limits are generally 50kph.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Crime**

Foreigners are often the targets of robbery, pickpocketing and bag snatching. Pickpocketing is common around Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, in restaurants and tourist accommodation, on public transport and at transport hubs. Take particular care in central Amsterdam (especially Central Station), in Schiphol (Amsterdam) airport, and on the trains between Schiphol airport and Amsterdam city.

There are reports of bag snatching on trains and trams, including those that operate through Schiphol (Amsterdam) Airport. Thieves sometimes operate in pairs, with one attempting to distract you while the other steals your possessions. People using automatic teller machines (ATMs) around nightclubs and bars are frequent targets.

There are reports of thieves posing as plain clothes policemen. The thieves ask to inspect currency and credit cards looking for counterfeits. Tourists handing over money have been robbed.

* Do not carry your passport when out unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave your passport, spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Incidents of drink spiking have been reported. Do not accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.

### **Reporting a crime**

If a victim of a crime while in The Netherlands, report it to the local police immediately. Most Dutch police ("Politie" in Dutch) speak excellent English. Please contact the Irish Embassy in The Hague if assistance is required.
