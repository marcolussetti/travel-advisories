## Entry requirements

### **Entry and Exit**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter The Netherlands, however non-EU citizens normally resident in Ireland with a spouse or family member may need a visa if travelling through The Netherlands to go on holiday abroad. They may also need a re-entry visa to return to Ireland even if you have legal residence in Ireland and a valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card. Please contact The Netherlands Embassy in Dublin on **+353 (0)1 269 3444** for information on Schengen visas if travelling to or transiting through The Netherlands.
