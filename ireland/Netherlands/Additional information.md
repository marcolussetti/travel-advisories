## Additional information

### **Entry and exit**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter The Netherlands, however non-EU citizens normally resident in Ireland with a spouse or family member may need a visa if travelling through The Netherlands to go on holiday abroad. They may also need a re-entry visa to return to Ireland even if you have legal residence in Ireland and a valid GNIB card. Please contact The Netherlands Embassy in Dublin on **+353 (0)1 269 3444** for information on Schengen visas if travelling to or transiting through The Netherlands.

### **Frequently Asked Questions on Passports and (re-entry) Visas**

**I think I have lost my passport! What should I do?**

* Look again – have someone else sift through your belongings with fresh eyes. Have a friend check your bag, pockets, drawers, safes, and suitcases. If at home, be sure to search the clothes you were wearing the last time you used your passport. Once your passport is reported lost, it cannot be used again even if you find it.
* Call the embassy – if certain the passport is gone, contact the Embassy on **0031 70 306 7130**. A staff member will tell you what you need to do to get a replacement document. You should also file a report with the nearest police station. A police report will be needed for a replacement travel document and also to make a claim on your travel insurance.
* If travelling to Ireland or the UK we can issue you with an emergency travel document. You must come to the Embassy in person as the emergency travel document cannot be emailed or delivered to you. Two passport photos, a police report, proof of travel and identification are needed in order for us to issue your new document. There will also be a fee for the document.
* Please note that Embassy The Hague does not have the facility to issue temporary passports.
* Remember the Embassy is not in Amsterdam, it is in The Hague, approximately 1.5 hours by train from Amsterdam, so you may need to review your travel plans to come to the Embassy.
* Some airlines will allow travel back to Ireland if you have other photo ID and a report from the police, so check with your airline or call the Embassy.

**Can you email or deliver a new travel document to me?**

* No. Citizens must come in person to the Embassy and bring two passport photos (for the new document), police report, proof of travel, the fee and identification.

**I always carry my passport on nights out as proof of my age. Is that ok?**

* Lots of people lose their passport when it falls out of pockets or bags. Your passport is an important document and should always be kept safe. Do not carry it with you unless absolutely necessary – if you need to have carry personal ID, bring a photocopy of your passport or better still, apply for the [**Passport Card**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-card/) for travel within Europe - it’s only €35 and fits in a purse or wallet so it’s less likely to get lost.
* Email a photo of your passport and give additional paper copies of your passport to somebody at home who can send them to you if required.
* Other ID such as the Garda age card is available for just €10 at [**www.agecard.ie**](https://www.agecard.ie/forms/home/) .

I have been travelling a lot in recent years and my passport is a bit worn looking. Is that ok?

* Normal wear or fading of the lettering on the cover should not be a problem. However if there is any damage or signs of tampering such as missing pages, or cracks on the photo page, you may have your passport taken from you by Dutch immigration. Citizens will not be able to travel onward and will need to go to the Irish Embassy in The Hague for a temporary replacement document to get back to Ireland or the UK.
* If travelling elsewhere you may need a temporary passport. At present these are not available from the Embassy in The Hague. Our staff will advise you. Citizens will need to travel to our Embassy in Brussels. Remember some countries will not accept a temporary passport as it does not have the same security data as a regular one.

I am a non-EU citizen who is resident in Ireland with my spouse/family member and will be travelling through Amsterdam to go on holiday abroad. Do I need a re-entry visa?

* Yes, since Ireland is not part of the Schengen travel area, anyone who (based on their nationality) normally requires a visa for The Netherlands or Schengen area would still require one. Legal residency in Ireland does not change this requirement. Please contact the Netherlands Embassy in Dublin on +353 (0)1 269 3444 for information on Schengen visas if travelling to or transiting through The Netherlands.
* Please also note that even if you have legal residency in Ireland and a valid GNIB card, you are required to have an Irish re-entry visa if you leave the State and wish to return (this applies only to those nationalities which are normally require a visa required to enter Ireland).

#### **Any other tips?**

* Plan ahead and check your passport expiry date before you book your holidays. Check the kids’ passports too as they expire more quickly than adult ones.
