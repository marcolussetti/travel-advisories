## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Tunisia, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Embassy Of Ireland, Morocco**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/morocco/rabat/)

Please note that if you require urgent assistance while the Embassy is closed, you should call the duty officer on +212 666 933 599, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox. This mailbox is monitored regularly.

Monday to Friday 09:00-18:00
