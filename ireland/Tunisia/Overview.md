## Overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Since terrorist attacks on tourist targets and state security forces in 2015, the Tunisian authorities declared a state of emergency and put in place a series of measures to strengthen security. See further information on terrorism threat in the ‘Safety and Security’ tab. The state of emergency has been extended on several occasions and remains in force.

Demonstrations may take place in different parts of the country, especially in the centre of Tunis and other large cities. Unrest and clashes linked to the demonstrations are possible so they should be avoided and caution and vigilance are urged.

The Department recommends against all travel to the following specific areas:

* the Chaambi Mountain National Park area
* within 30 km of the borders with Algeria and Libya
* the town of Ben Guerdane and the immediate surrounding area
* the militarized zone in Tatouine Governorate that lies south of, but does not include, the town of El Borma

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Tunisia.

A valid passport is required for travel to Tunisia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months at least from date of entry into Tunisia.

**Passport Card not accepted for travel to Tunisia:** A passport card is **not** accepted as it is only valid for travel within the EU, EEA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), Switzerland and the UK. If you seek to enter Tunisia on a passport card, you may be detained airside in the airport for several days until the next direct flight back to Ireland, or any other country listed above.
