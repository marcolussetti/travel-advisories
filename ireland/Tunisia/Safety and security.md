## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Terrorists have carried out a number of attacks in recent years.  
Since terrorist attacks in 2015 that targeted foreign tourists in Sousse, resulting in the death of three Irish citizens, and at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, additional security measures have been put in place to protect the country's major cities and tourist attractions. The risk of further terrorist attacks, or attempted attacks, remains high.

We advise Irish citizens in Tunisia to exercise a high degree of caution and a strong level of security awareness. You should follow the instructions of local authorities and keep yourself informed of the situation on the ground by, for example, staying in contact with tour operator or other local sources of information. It is important to avoid risky situations and unnecessary travel, especially at night outside urban areas. The border areas of the country should be avoided, in particular.

As crowded areas, transport hubs, and places frequented by foreigners could be targeted by terrorists, we advise particular vigilance in these areas.

### **Border areas**

Tunisia's borders with Libya and Algeria are open, but the security situation is very tense. Unrest in Libya continues to have a serious impact on the security of southern Tunisia, with a significant increase in cross-border trafficking and the availability of weapons, and occasional violent clashes between armed groups and the Tunisian security forces. Border crossing points can be temporarily closed without notice.

Do not travel to:

* The Chaambi Mountain National Park
* Within 30 km of the borders with Algeria and Libya
* the town of Ben Guerdane and the immediate surrounding area
* the militarized zone in Tatouine Governorate that lies south of, but does not include, the town of El Borma (Tunisia’s Greater South).

There is a risk of kidnap from terrorists operating in the south of Tunisia, close to the border with Algeria. You must get permission from the Tunisian authorities (National Guard) to enter certain desert areas near the border with Algeria. It is recommended that you do not travel to this region, but if you plan to do so, you are strongly advised to travel with a reputable tour operator or a licensed local guide.

### **State of emergency**

Following an explosion in central Tunis on 24th November 2015, a state-of-emergency was imposed. It has been extended on a number of occasions and remains in place.

You should follow the instructions given by local security authorities and/or your tour operator. Carry a copy of your passport, or other form of photo ID, at all times as proof of nationality and identity.

### **Demonstrations**

Tunisia experiences frequent demonstrations and protests. Travellers are advised to avoid protests and demonstrations. It may be advisable to avoid the centre of major cities on Friday afternoons, which is when most demonstrations take place. Always keep yourself informed of what's going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour operator.

### **Crime**

Incidents involving petty crimes do occur. Be aware that pickpockets operate in crowded marketplaces and bag-snatching does happen in tourist areas. You can minimise these risks by taking precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.  Be vigilant and do not carry all of your important documents and valuables in one bag.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations

### **Kidnapping**

There is a risk of kidnap from terrorists operating in the south of Tunisia, close to the border with Algeria.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Tunisia, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact the Honorary Consulate in Tunis or the Irish Embassy in Morocco if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Tunisia, you should be extremely careful as traffic can be fast and erratic. If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Pedestrians**

Pedestrians should also be extremely careful, particularly when crossing roads and regardless of whether there is a signal allowing pedestrians to cross – drivers don’t always stop.
