## Travel to Namibia overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **General Travel Advice**

As with all international travel, Irish citizens are encouraged to [**register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their details and travel plans with the Embassy when visiting Namibia, and to share these details with family and friends in advance of traveling.

The Namibian Government instated new visa requirements, which came into force on 1 April 2025. These requirements apply to Irish citizens, who are required to obtain a visa and pay the associated fee. Visas can be obtained and payments made on arrival or in advance of travel, via an online application, which is recommended.

For more information please visit the following website [**E-Services: Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration, Safety and Security | E-Services Portal**](https://eservices.mhaiss.gov.na/).

Irish citizens are advised to confirm all visa requirements with the Namibian High Commission in London, or with Namibia’s immigration authorities, prior to travel. A valid passport is required for travel to Namibia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months from the date of entry into Namibia and have at least three completely blank pages for Namibian Immigration to use. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Namibia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrelandinZambia**](https://twitter.com/IrelandinZambia) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinZambia)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if visitors have problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Namibia by dialling 10111.

Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: +264 (61) 10111
* Fire brigade (including ambulance services): +264 (61) 211 111

As there is no Irish Embassy in Namibia, we are limited in the help we can offer citizens in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Lusaka, Zambia**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/zambia/lusaka/)**.**
