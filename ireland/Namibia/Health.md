### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Please note that while the Embassy can provide information on local medical supports it cannot provide medical advice or pay for medical bills.

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade **strongly recommends** getting comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all activities you want to undertake.

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical facilities are quite good in Windhoek but you may be expected to pay for treatment up front even if you have insurance. Make sure you are fully aware of the conditions in your insurance policy and what cover is provided should you become ill or involved in an accident whilst in Namibia.

### **Malaria, Rabies and Cholera**

Malaria, rabies and cholera are common in Namibia and pose a serious health risk.Â Consult a GP and review relevant precautions before traveling.

### **HIV and AIDS**

HIV and AIDS is prevalent in Namibia with prevalence estimates at 13.% of the adult population. If engaging in activities that expose you to possible HIV infection, make sure to take adequate precautions. If you suspect that you have been exposed, seek immediate medical attention.

### **Water**

Only drink or use boiled or bottled water. If you suffer from diarrhoea during a visit to Namibia, get immediate medical attention.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from a GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of prescription in case you lose your medication.
