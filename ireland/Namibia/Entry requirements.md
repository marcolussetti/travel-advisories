## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

The Namibian Government instated new visa requirements, which came into force on 1 April 2025. These requirements apply to Irish citizens, who are required to obtain a visa and pay the associated fee. Visas can be obtained and payments made on arrival or in advance of travel, via an online application, which is recommended.

Information regarding visa requirements and their associated costs is available online from the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration, Safety and Security website and on their e-services webpage.

### **Passport**

Irish passports should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Namibia and have at least 2 completely blank pages for Namibian Immigration to use. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Namibia and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay. In addition, it is advisable to carry copies of relevant documents (such as birth certificates) relating to any minors who traveling as these documents may be requested by immigration officials when arriving or exiting Namibia.

If your passport is lost or stolen while in Namibia, contact the Irish Embassy in Lusaka in Zambia who will be able to assist and advise regarding the application for an Emergency Travel Certificate. Note, we will not provide you with a travel document without a police report. A police report will also likely be required if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time, particularly as Ireland does not have resident Embassy in Namibia. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can provide.
