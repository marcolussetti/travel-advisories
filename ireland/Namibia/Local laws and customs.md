## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Drug taking and/or smuggling are criminal offences in Namibia and the punishments are severe.

### **Personal identification**

Always carry identification with you â€“ a photocopy of the relevant passport page should be sufficient.

### **LGBTI+**

While homosexuality is not explicitly illegal, colonial era laws still criminalise sex between men. There is currently a strong conservative social backlash against any further liberalisation on LGBTI+ issues that may affect travellers.

### **Photography**

While there are no formal rules limiting photography at public buildings, be cautious. If the army or police are protecting a building, check with them before taking a photograph.

### **Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs**

A licence is required to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts. Punishments for buying or trafficking these goods, including ivory and rhino horn, include significant fines and/or prison sentence.
