### **Drought**

The southern Africa region is experiencing severe drought and many States have announced national emergencies, including Namibia. Travellers should be aware that this may pose additional unforeseen difficulties and should note that many areas may experience water and power shortages as a result.

### **General Travel Advice**

As with all international travel, Irish citizens are encouraged to [**register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their details and travel plans with the Embassy when visiting Namibia, and to share these details with family and friends in advance of traveling.

Irish citizens may travel to Namibia for the purpose of tourism for up to 90 days without visa. Namibian Immigration Authorities may stamp a shorter period in the passport in which case the permission will need to be renewed.

On 27 June 2024, the Namibian Government instated new visa requirements, which are due to come into force on 1 April 2025. These requirements will apply to Irish citizens and will consist of a visa on arrival, or by online application at a cost of N$1600. Further information will be provided when it becomes available. Current visa requirements, as detailed above, are expected to remain in place until that date.

Irish citizens are advised to confirm all visa requirements with the Namibian High Commission in London, or with Namibia’s immigration authorities, prior to travel. A valid passport is required for travel to Namibia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months from the date of entry into Namibia and have at least two completely blank pages for Namibian Immigration to use. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Namibia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media ([**@IrelandinZambia**](https://twitter.com/IrelandinZambia) **on X** and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinZambia)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if visitors have problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Namibia by dialling 10111.

Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: +264 (61) 10111
* Fire brigade (including ambulance services): +264 (61) 211 111

As there is no Irish Embassy in Namibia, we are limited in the help we can offer citizens in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Lusaka, Zambia**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/zambia/lusaka/)**.**
