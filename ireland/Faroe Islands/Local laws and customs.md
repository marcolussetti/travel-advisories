### **Whaling Season**

The annual “Grindadráp” whaling season in the Faroe Islands generally takes place in the summer months between June and September. This event has attracted protesters and there will be an increased security presence during this period. Anyone engaging in potentially dangerous acts, including to life and/or property, could be arrested.

### **Currency**

The currency in the Faroe Islands is the Danish krone. Cash is used for payment less frequently than in Ireland, although ATMs are easy to find. Credit and debit cards are commonly used for payments, although foreign cards can attract a surcharge.
