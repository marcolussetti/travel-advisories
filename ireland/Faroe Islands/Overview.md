### **Emergency Assistance**

The Faroe Islands are a small group of 18 islands, located in the North Atlantic Ocean. The weather can change very suddenly, and driving, hiking and sailing conditions can quickly become hazardous with sudden fog or wind.

Citizens travelling in the Faroe Islands, should make themselves aware of the risks and follow the advice of local authorities at all times.
