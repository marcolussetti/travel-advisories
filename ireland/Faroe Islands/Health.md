## Health

Visitors who become ill while travelling in the Faroe Islands, can be treated in the local health system. However, in the event of serious illness or injury, visitors may be evacuated to Denmark or Iceland for treatment.

Visitors should ensure to travel with sufficient supplies of any required medications as it may not be possible to purchase these locally. Visitors should be aware that, due to changing weather conditions, flights can sometimes be cancelled and it may be necessary to remain in the Faroe Islands longer than planned.

As the Faroe Islands are not part of the EU, the European Health Insurance Card does not provide coverage there.
