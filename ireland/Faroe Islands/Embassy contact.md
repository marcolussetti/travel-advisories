## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in the Faroe Islands, consular assistance is provided via the [**Embassy of Ireland in Copenhagen, Denmark**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/denmark/copenhagen/)**.**

Please note that if you require assistance in the case of emergency while the Embassy is closed, citizens can contact the main Embassy number, +45 35 47 32 00, and leave a message on the Duty Officer mailbox.

This mailbox is monitored regularly.
