## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Turks & Caicos Islands, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Washington DC**](/en/usa/washington/)**.**

If you are in need of emergency assistance, please contact the Embassy at + 1-202-462-3939 and leave a message on the answering machine.

The answering machine is monitored regularly and the Duty Officer will contact you as soon as possible.

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin at + 353-1-408 2000.
