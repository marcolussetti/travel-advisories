## Safety and security

### **Security**

As elsewhere in Europe, terrorist attacks may occur with no advance notice. Irish citizens are advised to monitor local media and follow the advice of the local police and local authorities. It is important to exercise increased vigilance, especially when travelling on public transport, if attending large public gatherings or visiting other crowded locations, particularly those that have a large concentration of foreign citizens. Attacks could occur at any time and could target tourist attractions, restaurants, transport hubs or other public areas. Citizens should remain aware of their surroundings and ensure they have access to exits or escape routes at all times.

### **Political Situation**

Protests, often at short notice, can be expected across major cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Protests have remained largely peaceful but there remains a small risk of violence. Keep up-to-date with developments, be vigilant, and avoid protests. Remain aware in of your surroundings while in public spaces, and respond accordingly.

### **Landmines**

Landmines remain a very real danger in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Highly populated areas and major routes are now clear of mines and are generally safe to visit, but material can be dislodged during periods of heavy rainfall. Isolated areas in the mountains and countryside, including Sarajevo’s immediate hinterland, have not all been cleared.

We recommend not to stray from roads and paved areas without an experienced guide and avoid the open countryside, especially destroyed or abandoned buildings and villages. Never enter areas that are taped off.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Bosnia and Herzegovina but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* There have been a number of thefts from 'locked’ compartments on trains so make sure that the compartment door is properly locked and that all valuables are placed out of sight or well away from the door.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, report it to the local police immediately and get a report. Call the police on 122, and citizens can contact the Irish Embassy in Ljubljana on +386 1 300 8970 if assistance is required.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina, be aware that driving after dark is especially dangerous and street lighting is uncommon outside the larger towns. Conditions can also be hazardous due to poorly maintained roads, the effects of harsh winter weather and morning and evening fog in the mountains. Remember, traffic laws and regulations are similar to those in other Western European countries and vehicles drive on the right hand side of the road. If driving:

* Bring an international driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. The blood alcohol limit is 0.03.
* Be aware of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s traffic laws, such as speed limits. Traffic police have the power to impose on-the-spot fines for any traffic offence.
* Driving with dipped headlamps is required at all times in Bosnia and Herzegovina and not just after dark.
* Between 15 November and 15 April, it is obligatory to have winter tyres on vehicles. Alternatively, use summer tyres with a minimum thread of 4mm as long as snow chains are in the vehicle and you can demonstrate, if asked, how to fit them correctly.
* Get more information on traffic and safety from the [**Automobile Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina**](http://bihamk.ba/).

### **Car documentation**

Bring all of the relevant ownership/rental and registration information as border guards may ask to see them.

If driving to, or through, Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the 9.5km road section at Neum on the Dalmatian Coastal Highway, ensure that your Green Card includes cover for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
