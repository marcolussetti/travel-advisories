## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Holders of Irish passports do not need visas for short stay visits of up to 90 days.

### **Passport**

Make sure your passport is valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of your departure from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay carry a photocopy at all times.

A number of airlines during the checking-in process require that a passport would also be valid on the date of the return flight. It is therefore advisable to renew a passport to ensure validity of the passport for the entire period of travel and any visa or other requirements.

### **Registration**

All foreign nationals must register with the police within 48 hours of arrival. Hotels will usually arrange this for their guests. If intending to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina for more than six months you must apply for temporary residence as well as registering with the local police.

Get more information on entry and stay of foreign nationals from the [**Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina**](http://msb.gov.ba/inf_za_strance/default.aspx?id=3068&langTag=en-US).

### **Travelling with Children**

A person under 18 who has his/her own passport can cross the Bosnia and Herzegovina border if he/she is accompanied by one or both parents, custodian or a legal guardian. A minor travelling without one or both parents, custodian or legal guardian must have a notarised statement from them stating that they permit the minor to cross the border.

The statement must contain the following data:

* Personal information of the minor (name, date and place of birth, passport number, current address).
* Personal information of both parents or legal guardians.
* Personal information of the person accompanying the minor (if the minor is travelling with another adult).
* Dates and reason for travel to and from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* Time period for which the statement is valid.
* Signature of both parents, custodian or legal guardian.

The statement must be in one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian) or in English and must be notarised by a person authorised by law to take oaths, such as a notary public.
