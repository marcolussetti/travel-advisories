## Health

Medical services can be limited in parts of the Bosnia and Herzegovina. In some towns, first-aid centres often operated by medical volunteers provide only basic first-aid treatments. In addition, the officially sanctioned payment arrangements for medical services can vary across the country.

People intending to travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, including to Medjugorje, with an existing medical condition are advised to consult a doctor before making travel plans and travelling.

In many of the larger cities and towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the air quality can be quite low between November and March. People with, in particular, respiratory conditions or with other health situations should consult and monitor advisory websites such as the [**World Air Quality Index**](https://waqi.info/).

As the heat can become quite intense, particularly during the period June-September, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, visitors are strongly advised to remain hydrated by regularly drinking water, to keep their heads suitably covered, and to keep their eyes hydrated.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### **Travel Insurance**

Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a member of the EU/EEA. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) cannot be used to access healthcare services in this country.

Before travelling to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is very strongly recommended that comprehensive travel insurance is obtained which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. The comprehensive medical insurance taken out should also be tailored to include any pre-existing medical conditions.

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is pruchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) purchasing a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

### **Emergency expenses**

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
