## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

The entry requirements are that holders of Irish passports do not need visas for short stay visits of up to 90 days. Please note, however, that the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities require that passports must be valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of departure from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### **Passports**

Make sure your passport is valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of your departure from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay carry a photocopy at all times.

A number of airlines during the checking-in process require that a passport would also be valid on the date of the return flight. It is therefore advisable to renew a passport to ensure validity of the passport for the entire period of travel and any visa or other requirements.

### **Registration**

All foreign nationals must register with the police within 48 hours of arrival. Hotels will usually arrange this for their guests. If intending to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina for more than six months you must apply for temporary residence as well as registering with the local police.

Get more information on entry and stay of foreign nationals from the [**Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina**](http://msb.gov.ba/inf_za_strance/default.aspx?id=3068&langTag=en-US).

### **Travelling with children**

A person under 18 who has his/her own passport can cross the Bosnia and Herzegovina border if he/she is accompanied by one or both parents, custodian or a legal guardian. A minor travelling without one or both parents, custodian or legal guardian must have a notarised statement from them stating that they permit the minor to cross the border.

The statement must contain the following data:

* Personal information of the minor (name, date and place of birth, passport number, current address).
* Personal information of both parents or legal guardians.
* Personal information of the person accompanying the minor (if the minor is travelling with another adult).
* Dates and reason for travel to and from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* Time period for which the statement is valid.
* Signature of both parents, custodian or legal guardian.

The statement must be in one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian) or in English and must be notarised by a person authorised by law to take oaths, such as a notary public. For more information, please contact the [**Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in London**](http://bhembassy.co.uk/).

### **Money**

Most transactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina are made in cash. The local currency is the Konvertible Mark, and although some businesses may accept Euro notes in place of these, the Euro is not legal tender in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is also possible to cash travellersâ€™ cheques at most banks. However, it is still advisable to bring enough cash with you if travelling outside large cities.

### **ATMs**

ATMs are increasingly available and credit and debit cards are accepted in Sarajevo, and increasingly, elsewhere across the country. If you have an ATM card bearing a Maestro or Cirrus symbol, you should be able to withdraw funds from your Irish account.

### **Public transport**

Local rail, bus and tram services are generally reliable, but are currently not operating or severely restricted.

### **Taxis**

The taxis service is also currently very limited and in addition please note that taxi drivers from the two political entities in the country (the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) may be unwilling to travel from one entity to another.

### **Earthquakes**

Earthquakes are not uncommon in Bosnia and Herzegovina and small tremors are recorded throughout the year without consequences.
