## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

Public demonstrations and protests are more common in Argentina than in Ireland. You may encounter groups of demonstrators (piqueteros) blocking major roads into and out of the capital, as well as access to airports, causing delays and possibly a change in route.

In particular, the areas around the Obelisco and the National Congress tend to see large demonstrations.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Argentina is relatively low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Petty theft**

You should be aware of the risk of petty theft in the city of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires and other major cities.

Thieves normally target unattended or free-hanging bags, pockets and mobile phones, and operate on public transport, stations, crowded streets, and in restaurants and bars.

Most theft in Argentina is opportunistic, taking advantage of a personâ€™s distraction, such as leaving handbags or backpacks on the floor or hanging from a chair while eating, travelling in public transport or walking in the street without closing zippers. Phones and laptops should never be left on a table unattended in a restaurant, particularly if you are sitting near a footpath.

It is common for thieves to work in pairs, with one person causing a distraction, for example by asking questions, dropping something or falling down, while another commits the theft. In addition, it is a common for wallets or phones to be snatched while being used on the street, particularly around busy train and bus stations.

Likewise, you must be attentive while in taxis and avoid using a phone or having your handbag in your lap with the windows open or the door unlocked.

Locals do not generally carry with them large amounts of money, foreign currency, cameras, valuable jewellery or luxury watches. As such, thieves looking for such items will especially target tourist areas. While you should avoid carrying valuables in Argentina in general, it is advised to exercise extra caution in Buenos Aires, particularly in the areas around La Boca, Congreso, Plaza de Mayo, Obelisco, Puerto Madero and Palermo.

When withdrawing money from an ATM or exchanging currency, be very attentive of your surroundings. If you are being watched, or feel unsafe, it is best not to take any money out at all. It is also a good practice to leave with a taxi instead of walking away, as you might be followed.

You should always:

* Keep a close eye on your personal possessions;
* Divide your money to avoid taking it all out at once in public;
* Avoid carrying all your valuables in one place;
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing jewellery;
* Keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe (such as a cloud storage);
* Avoid isolated or poorly lit areas at night;
* Suspect strangers approaching you, including street vendors;
* Avoid packing valuables in checked luggage;
* Avoid leaving valuables, especially passports, in overhead compartments in long-distance buses;
* Lock your room when you return to your hotel or accommodation.

### **Reporting crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Argentina, report it to the local police or the Tourist Police (in the city of Buenos Aires) immediately. Please contact us at the Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you are planning to drive in Argentina, be extremely careful. Road safety standards vary throughout the country, and small provincial roads might be gravel or poorly paved. Respect for speed limits in highways and traffic signals is patchy; and manoeuvres by fellow road users can be unexpected. Bus drivers and motorcycles users, in particular, tend to drive haphazardly.

Crime against car users, particularly when stopped at traffic lights, is a growing concern and we advise you to keep windows closed and doors locked at all times, particularly when driving in the city.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance;
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you are stopped at traffic lights;
* Inform yourself of local driving laws in advance, as they might vary from what you are used to. Keep in mind that compliance with speed limits and red lights (including stopping before the pedestrian crossing) is monitored with hidden cameras and incurs in steep fines;
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined, having your vehicle impounded or banned from driving if caught. In multiple provinces and in the city of Buenos Aires, there is a zero tolerance for alcohol consumption when driving;
* Tolls: most districts required an electronic tag to pay tolls. The city of Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires in particular require this system. Payment in cash, when available, might incur in significant surcharges (up to 4 times the value);
* We recommend leaving the vehicle at paid parking garages, which are safer. In all circumstances, but especially if parking in the street, do not leave any bags or valuables visible.

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times, or bring a copy with you.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Climbing, Hiking, and Trekking**

The Irish Embassy in Argentina strongly discourages Irish citizens from climbing, hiking and trekking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, many tourists have disappeared or been seriously injured while solo climbing/hiking and trekking. Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings. Follow Park Ranger and Search and Rescue Team advice and instructions.

Update your SOS or GPS emergency locator information, make sure your device is enabled to function in the park or trail and add local rescue teams as your first emergency contact.

We strongly recommend that before you travel you purchase supplemental travel and evacuation insurance, provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to climbing, hiking, and trekking.
