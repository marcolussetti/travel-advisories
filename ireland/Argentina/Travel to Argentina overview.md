Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Argentina.

A valid passport is required for travel to Argentina. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the additional information at [**Obtener visa de turista para ingresar a la Argentina | Argentina.gob.ar**](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/servicio/obtener-visa-de-turista-para-ingresar-la-argentina) (in Spanish).

Public demonstrations and protests are frequent following the change in Government in December 2023.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid all demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

### **Surrogacy in Argentina**

Irish citizens should be aware that there is considerable uncertainty around the legal framework relating to surrogacy in Argentina at present. It is our understanding that entering into surrogacy arrangements in Argentina gives rise to significant legal complications, including the possibility of criminal law implications.

Therefore, we strongly recommend that Irish citizens do not engage in surrogacy in Argentina.

### **Regional Risks**

You should be aware of the risk of petty theft in the city of Buenos Aires. Thieves normally target small bags, pockets and mobile phones, and operate on public transport, crowded streets and in restaurants and bars (more on this in the Safety and Security Section).

Greater Buenos Aires (Conurbano) is an area of greater risk for petty theft, bag-snatching and vandalism. You should not park vehicles outside parking garages, carry valuables at any time of day or walk alone during the night.

Rosario, in the Province of Santa Fe is an area of high risk for organized drug-related and at times violent crime. Exercise a high degree of caution.

At Iguazu falls, the tri-border area between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay is also a risk are for organized crime. Plan ahead to ensure you cross the border during daytime.

Visitors to Argentina are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
