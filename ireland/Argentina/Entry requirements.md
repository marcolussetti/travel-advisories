## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

There are no visa requirements for Irish citizens traveling to Argentina for touristic purposes (up to 90 days).

Six month passport validity is required from the date of entry to Argentina and one blank passport page. Please check your passport in plenty of time before travel and if it needs to be renewed please use our [**Online Passport Renewal System**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Irish citizens travelling to Argentina for other purposes should contact their nearest Argentinian Embassy in advance of their visit to clarify their visa requirements.
