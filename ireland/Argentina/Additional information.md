### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling (8 weeks) to see if any vaccinations are required for Argentina.

There is a risk of both Dengue and Zika Virus (both mosquito-borne diseases) in Central and South America. Irish citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/). Measures to prevent mosquito bites, such as the use of repellent and wearing long sleeves and trousers, are recommended.

### **Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**

Argentina has the highest frequency of Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in the world. HUS is a condition that affects the blood and blood vessels and affects children between 1 and 5 years old. It may result in destruction of blood platelets, anaemia and kidney failure.

In most cases, HUS is caused by consuming food contaminated with bacteria, or drinking unclean water. It is more prevalent in the warmer months (September to March).

The Argentine Paediatric Association has issued the following recommendations:

- All beef should be cooked properly, and ground beef must be well-done. Children under the age of 5 should not eat ground beef while in Argentina;

- Wash all fruit and vegetables before eating them;

- Wash your hands with soap after changing diapers and using the bathroom, touching animals, and before preparing any food;

- Do not consume unpasteurised dairy products. All dairy products should be kept cold until consumption;

- Use safe water. If you are uncertain about the quality of the water, and unable to obtain bottled water, boil it first. Tap water in Buenos Aires and most large cities is safe to consume.

If a child is experiencing abdominal pain, watery or bloody diarrhea, paleness and lack of appetite, seek immediate medical attention.
