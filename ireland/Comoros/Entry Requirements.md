## Entry Requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter or travel through Comoros as a visitor. You can get a visa on arrival at Hahaya airport or at other points of entry for €30.

### **Passports**

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date you arrive. It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Comoros and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help by issuing you an emergency travel document that will get you home.

We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Comoros there may be additional complications in processing an application for an emergency travel document.

You should contact the Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, for more information including on associated fees.
