## Entry Requirements

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Gabon and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Gabon there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

Citizens should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what is required to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise on the fees which apply.

### **Our advice**

Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Gabon so we cannot verify detailed travel advice to ensure that it is accurate, appropriate and up to date. However, we encourage travellers to conduct their own research and to read these links to travel advice from other foreign ministries:
