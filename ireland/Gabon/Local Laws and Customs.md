## Local Laws and Customs

Remember, the local laws reflect the conservative society in Gabon and they apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may been seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal. Possession of drugs is an offence in Gabon and can result in a custodial sentence.
