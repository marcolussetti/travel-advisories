## Safety and security

Belize has high rates of violent crime. To avoid becoming the victim of a crime, visitors should take sensible precautions. Remain alert to surroundings and be vigilant at all times:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations.

While tourists are not normally the targets of gang violence, passers-by could be affected. Visitors should avoid unnecessary travel to the southern neighbourhoods of Belize City due to the high rate of violent crime and gang violence.

Visitors should take particular care when entering at land borders, and only use officially recognised border crossings.

If engaging in adventure tourism or outdoor activities, review weather conditions and the condition of equipment before departing. It is recommended to keep a friend or family member informed of plans and inform them when the activity is complete.

Road conditions and driving standards are poor. Overland travel outside the major cities and resort areas should be undertaken with caution and only during daylight hours. It is not advised to drive in rural areas during or immediately after heavy rains.

### **Hurricane season**

The hurricane season generally runs from June to November each year and can cause heavy rain, flooding and extremely high winds. Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](https://weather.com/en-IE/weather/today/l/EIXX0014:1:EI?Goto=Redirected), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).
