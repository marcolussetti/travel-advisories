## Health

Medical facilities in Belize are limited and availability of prescription medicine inconsistent.

Serious medical cases are normally evacuated to the United States (at the patientâ€™s expense). Make sure to have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

### **Zika Virus**

Belize may have a risk of Zika virus transmission. Irish citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system, or those who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow the guidance available on the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

Belize has also had cases of [**Chikungunya virus**](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/27/chikungunya).
