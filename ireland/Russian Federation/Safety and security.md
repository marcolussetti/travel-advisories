## Safety and security

### **Crime**

The vast majority of visits to the Russian Federation go smoothly. However, you should be vigilant at all times and also watch out for pickpockets and street crime, especially in large cities.

* You must carry your passport and migration card at all times in the Russian Federation. We would advise you to keep your passport in a safe place on your person, and not to leave it in jacket pockets or in handbags and / or backpacks in case of theft. You should also leave a copy of your passport, visa, and travel and insurance documents with family or friends at home.
* If you are stopped by police officers, always insist on seeing ID.
* Racially-motivated attacks by racist groups do occur in the Russian Federation. If you are of Asian, Afro-Caribbean or Southern European descent, we advise you to take extra care.
* Avoid openly carrying expensive items, or anything that might easily identify you as a tourist. Don't show large sums of money in public and don't use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations. Busy areas, such as railway concourses, particularly in St Petersburg, are used by thieves, who specifically target tourists.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible. Do not get into a taxi if there is already another passenger.
* Drink-spiking leading to robbery, violence and/or abuse does happen. Unconscious victims are often left outside, which can be life threatening in the winter months. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times.

### **Reporting a crime**

On 22 March 2024, a terrorist attack occurred at the Crocus City Hall music venue in Moscow resulted in 145 deaths and many injuries.
