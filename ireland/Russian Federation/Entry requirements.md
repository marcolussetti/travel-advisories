## Entry requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter the Russian Federation. Those who do not comply with Russian visa laws can be subject to arrest, fines, and/or deportation. Russian authorities will not allow an Irish citizen with an expired visa to depart the country, effectively obliging the person to remain in the Russian Federation at their own expense until local authorities grant an exit visa. It should be noted that the ability of the Embassy to intervene in such cases is extremely limited. It is very important that all Irish citizens travelling to the Russian Federation carefully check the validity of their visa, and pay particular attention to the expiry date, as it can differ from the dates of travel indicated in your visa application.

### **Migration Cards**

You’ll usually be asked to complete a migration card on the plane before you arrive in the Russian Federation. Alternatively, you may be asked to complete a migration card on reaching Passport Control at some airports.

One part of the card is submitted to Immigration on arrival and you must keep the other part of the card for the duration of your stay in the Russian Federation – you’ll need to show it when checking into hotels, when departing the Russian Federation and/or if asked for proof of identity by the police.

You must complete a new migration card each time you enter the Russian Federation, even if you have a multi-entry visa. Losing your migration card could delay your departure from the Russian Federation and you may be fined.

### **Registration**

You must also register your presence in the Russian Federation if you’re staying for more than seven days. If staying in a hotel, the hotel should organise this for you. If staying privately, you must be registered by the owner of the property at the nearest branch of the Federal Migration Service (FMS).

### **Passports**

You must have your passport and migration card with you at all times while in the Russian Federation.

You can get more information on entry/exit requirements and immigration information for the Russian Federation, please contact the [**Embassy of the Russian Federation**](https://dublin.kdmid.ru/en/contacts/) to Ireland.

### **Passport Validity**

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months after the expiry date of your visa.
