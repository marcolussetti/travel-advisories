## Travel to Russian Federation overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to the Russian Federation until further notice.

Irish citizens who are in Russia are advised to carefully consider the necessity of their continued stay in Russia. **The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow strongly recommends all Irish citizens to have plans in place to leave Russia, should their own circumstances deteriorate.** Due to staffing restrictions imposed by the Russian Government, the Embassy has significantly fewer resources to assist in a crisis. Irish citizens should not rely on the possibility of an organised evacuation occurring in the event of a crisis, and should instead have their own plans for departure in place.

Dual Irish-Russian citizens should be aware of the fact that the Russian Government will only recognise Russian citizenship for the purposes of local law enforcement and administration, including in areas of compulsory military service.

Information on current departure options from Russia is below. The Embassy strongly recommends that Irish Citizens research their options for departure both via an air route from Russia, and a land crossing into EU neighbouring states. The Embassy notes that should the situation in Russia become more volatile, air routes could very quickly be booked out or become unavailable.

Irish citizens resident in Russia who have not already done so are strongly recommended to register with the Embassy using the Department’s [**Citizens' Registration facility**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/). This is the way that the Embassy communicates with the Irish community to share information and updates.

### **Embassy Operations**

While normal operating hours continue in both the Embassy and the Visa Office, citizens should be aware of significant delays in processing documentation, including passports. This is due both to reduced staffing in the Embassy and ongoing difficulties in international post and shipping.

Citizens should also be mindful of the reduced ability of the Embassy to provide support in crisis scenarios, particularly for citizens situated far from Moscow.

If you have a query or need to make an appointment, please [**contact the Embassy**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/).

If you have a query regarding Irish visas, please [**contact the Visa Office**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/visa-queries/).

### **EU Sanctions and Effects on Business**

Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has introduced the most extensive restrictive measures (sanctions) in its history. These sanctions include measures targeting specific sectors, including the financial, energy, technology, defence, media and transport sectors, as well as individual measures targeting named persons and entities. EU restrictive measures are legally binding on all natural and legal persons in Ireland and the EU. EU Council Regulations have direct effect, and must therefore be complied with in the same way as domestic Irish legislation. In Ireland, it is a criminal offence to contravene EU sanctions.

All persons and entities considering doing business with Russian entities or travelling to Russia should ensure that their activities do not contravene EU sanctions, including the sanctions introduced since February 2022. Detailed information on sanctions in respect of the situation in Ukraine is available [**here**](https://www.gov.ie/en/publications/?q=&sort_by=published_date&type=press_releases&type=general_publications&type=speeches&organisation=department-of-foreign-affairs). [**The EU Sanctions Map**](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main) has information on all EU Sanctions Regimes in effect, as well as lists of the individuals and entities sanctioned under each Regime, and links to the EU legal acts for each Regime. A consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanctions is available via this [**page**](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/eu-and-world/sanctions-restrictive-measures/overview-sanctions-and-related-resources_en).

### **Mass Gatherings and Arbitrary Detention**

Irish citizens in Russia should be vigilant about their own safety and avoid mass gatherings, including protests or demonstrations. Please also be aware that laws that affect media freedom of expression can be used to impose severe and arbitrary sentences of up to 15 years in prison. Irish citizens should be mindful this includes posting or sharing banned content on social media.

### **Banking Restrictions in Russia**

Irish citizens in Russia should be mindful that severe limitations on banking, including the withdrawal of Visa and Mastercard services, directly affect their ability to access their money for the foreseeable future. Any citizens who have made the decision to travel to Russia should ensure they have adequate cash supplies for their stay and for emergencies, if they do not have a source of funding within Russia.

### **Transport Routes Out of Russia**

There are severely limited or no flight routes directly to the EU. Citizens wishing to return to Ireland via air are advised to book flights via Istanbul, Dubai, or Abu Dhabi.

Citizens intending to travel through these countries to Ireland should consult the Department’s Travel Advice in advance:

[**Travel Advice for Türkiye (Turkey)**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/turkiye/)

[**Travel Advice for UAE**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/united-arab-emirates/)

Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict when direct flight routes to EU countries will resume.

Options also exist for overland departure from the Russian Federation through Latvia and Estonia.

Citizens intending on taking overland routes to neighboring EU countries should check the [**travel advice**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/) and current border regulations for those countries before booking tickets and ensure they comply with entry regulations.

### **Citizens in Ukraine**

If you are an Irish national inside Ukraine, please register your details [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) and monitor the travel advice [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/), which is updated regularly.

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly recommends against all travel to Russia at this time. If you must travel to Russia, we recommend all inbound passengers to check regularly with their travel agent and/or airline, and to check the website of the Russian Embassy in Dublin to make sure they have the most up to date information.

Irish citizens travelling to Russia are advised to respect the validity of their Russian visa. A visa over-stay of even a few hours can have serious consequences potentially involving a court appearance, fine, and travel ban of up to 5 years.

A system of electronic visas has been introduced by the Russian Government in Summer 2023. More information on the details of this scheme can be found [**here.**](https://electronic-visa.kdmid.ru/)

Further information on entry requirements, visa requests, or immigration issues should be directed to your local Russian Embassy.

Irish citizens should ensure that the name on their visa exactly matches the one in their passport. Even a minor difference in spelling will result in entry to Russia being refused. The Embassy has no ability to assist in such cases.

For information relating to Ukraine, please visit the Department's [**Travel Advice**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/). The Embassy strongly advises against all travel to regions bordering Ukraine, due to the active conflict.

Given the volatile security situation in the North Caucasus, we strongly advise against all travel to Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan and to the eastern and southern parts of Stavropol Krai bordering Chechnya and Dagestan, including the Budyonnovsky, Levkumsky, Neftekumsky, Stepnovsky and Kursky regions.

We also advise against all but essential travel to North Ossetia, Karachai-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria (including the Elbrus region). Terrorism and kidnapping are a risk in these areas.

You can contact the emergency services in the Russian Federation by dialing 112.

Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 102
* Fire brigade: 101
* Ambulance: 103

Any Irish citizens normally resident in Ireland who are seeking assistance travelling home should [**contact**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/) the embassy.

Irish citizens resident in Russia who have not already done so are recommended to register their details with the Embassy [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/).
