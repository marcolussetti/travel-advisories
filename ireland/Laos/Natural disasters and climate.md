## Natural disasters and climate

### **Flooding**

The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to November, coinciding with the typhoon season in South East Asia. Mountain areas can be particularly vulnerable to landslides at this time and flooding may occur along river basins and elsewhere. Travel to some provinces can be seriously disrupted. The Mekong River Commission posts official updates on the Mekong River on their website. Monitor local news and weather reports, and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation in advance of travel.
