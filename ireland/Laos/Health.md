### Vaccinations

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Laos are required.

Please note that all visitors (planning to stay more than one month) are encouraged to be fully vaccinated against polio prior to arrival in the Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic. An [**order from the Office of the Lao Prime Minister**](https://www.ireland.ie/700/PM-Lao-PDR-Declaration-National-Public-Health-Emergency-Jan-2016.pdf) on 13 January 2016 declared a public health emergency due to a Polio outbreak.

### **Medical Facilities**

If you have an unstable medical condition you should seriously consider not travelling to Laos. Medical care in Vientiane is extremely basic and outside the capital there are no reliable facilities to deal with medical emergencies.

Medical evacuation is difficult to organise and very expensive. Make sure to have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

### **Cholera**

To avoid cholera and diarrhoeal illnesses the World Health Organisation advises everyone travelling to the province to practise good hygiene: wash hands with soap before and after eating, cooking and going to the toilet, eat only thoroughly-cooked foods and drink only safe water (bottled or boiled).

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever, particularly in Vientiane, is common. Avoid mosquito bites during the day, especially just after dawn and just before dusk by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. More information on dengue fever is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](http://www.who.int/topics/dengue/en/).

### **Malaria**

Malaria is also present in Laos. A doctor can advise you on appropriate prophylactic measures or vaccines, depending on the length of your stay and the areas you intend to visit.

### **Avian Influenza**

The risk to humans from avian influenza is believed to be very low. No human infections or deaths have been reported. As a precaution, however, avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds; and ensure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.
