## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Visa-on-arrival and e-Visa are available for travel to Lao PDR from Ireland. E-visas can be obtained before your departure [**here**](https://laoevisa.gov.la/index).

Tourist visas can only be extended twice in-country. Be aware that if you do not renew your visa within 90 days, new regulations set a fine of 2 million LAK, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Lao PDR.

### **Passports**

All visitors to Lao PDR must hold a passport that is valid for at least 6 months from the time of entry into Laos and contain at least two blank pages for a visa stamp.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport and to also carry a photocopy at all times.

Keep your passport safe as getting a new passport and exit visa can cause considerable delay and expense.

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Laos are required.

Please note that all visitors (planning to stay more than one month) are encouraged to be fully vaccinated against polio prior to arrival in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. An [**order from the Office of the Lao Prime Minister**](https://www.ireland.ie/700/PM-Lao-PDR-Declaration-National-Public-Health-Emergency-Jan-2016.pdf) on 13 January 2016 declared a public health emergency due to a Polio outbreak.

### **Medical facilities**

If you have an unstable medical condition you should seriously consider not travelling to Laos. Medical care in Vientiane is extremely basic and outside the capital there are no reliable facilities to deal with medical emergencies.

Medical evacuation is difficult to organise and very expensive. Make sure to have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

### **Cholera**

To avoid cholera and diarrhoeal illnesses the World Health Organisation advises everyone travelling to the province to practise good hygiene: wash hands with soap before and after eating, cooking and going to the toilet, eat only thoroughly-cooked foods and drink only safe water (bottled or boiled).

### **Dengue fever**

Dengue fever, particularly in Vientiane, is common. There is no vaccine against this disease. Avoid mosquito bites during the day, especially just after dawn and just before dusk by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. More information on dengue fever is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](http://www.who.int/topics/dengue/en/).

### **Malaria**

Malaria is also present in Laos. A doctor can advise you on appropriate prophylactic measures or vaccines, depending on the length of your stay and the areas you intend to visit.

### **Avian influenza**

The risk to humans from avian influenza is believed to be very low. No human infections or deaths have been reported. As a precaution, however, avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds; and ensure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.

### **Money**

Major credit cards are accepted at the larger international hotels and main tourist-orientated establishments. Travellers’ cheques can be cashed at most banks in Vientiane and major towns. International ATM facilities are increasingly available. Most transactions are conducted in cash using US Dollars, Thai Baht or Lao Kip.
