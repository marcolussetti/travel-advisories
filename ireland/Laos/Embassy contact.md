## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Laos, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Vietnam.

The Embassyâ€™s working hours are 9:00am to 4:30pm Monday to Friday, with a one hour break between 12pm and 1pm. If citizens require information outside these hours, please refer to the following options:

- Irish Citizens who require assistance in the case of a genuine emergency while the Embassy is closed, please contact us on +84 24 3974 3291 where you will be given details on how to proceed and how to contact a consular officer if needed.

- Alternatively, please contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin at +353 1 408 2000.
