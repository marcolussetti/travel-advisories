## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal identification**

During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times. It is illegal not to carry an ID document or a passport, and there can be high fines if you can not produce it on demand.

### **Law Enforcement**

The Lao Government prohibits sexual relationships between foreign citizens and Lao nationals, except when the two parties have been married in accordance with Lao Family Law. Fines for engaging in prohibited sexual contact can be severe and penalties may also include imprisonment.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Do not get involved with drugs of any kind. There have been several deaths as a result of drug use among foreign nationals visiting Laos. Possession, trafficking and manufacture of drugs are serious offences in Laos and are punishable by lengthy prison sentences, including the death penalty.

While cigarettes are legal, e-cigarettes/vapes and heated tobacco such as shisha are illegal in Laos and punishable by fines or imprisonment.

### **Money**

Major credit cards are accepted at the larger international hotels and main tourist-orientated establishments. Travellersâ€™ cheques can be cashed at most banks in Vientiane and major towns. International ATM facilities are increasingly available. Most transactions are conducted in cash using US Dollars, Thai Baht or Lao Kip.
