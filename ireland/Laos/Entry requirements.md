## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Visa-on-arrival and e-Visa are available for travel to Lao PDR from Ireland. E-visa can be obtained before your departure [**here**](https://laoevisa.gov.la/index).

Tourist visas can only be extended twice in-country. Be aware that if you do not renew your visa within 90 days, new regulations set a fine of 2 million LAK, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Lao PDR.

### **Passport**

All visitors to Lao PDR must hold a passport that is valid for at least 6 months from the time of entry into Laos and contain at least two blank pages for a visa stamp.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport and to also carry a photocopy at all times.

Keep your passport safe as getting a new passport and exit visa can cause considerable delay and expense.
