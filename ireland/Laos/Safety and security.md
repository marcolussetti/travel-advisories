## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

There are ongoing security concerns related to ethnic conflicts, banditry, and unexploded munitions in Laos and visitors should exercise caution if planning to travel to the country. Skirmishes between government forces and unidentified groups have taken place along the Lao-Thai border and there have been armed attacks on some routes, including Routes 6, 7 and 13. Visitors should also exercise increased caution in remote areas along the border with Burma (Myanmar).

### **Landmines**

Landmines and unexploded munitions are a risk, particularly in Xieng Khouang Province (Plain of Jars), and at the Lao-Vietnamese border areas that were formerly crossed by the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Avoid these areas if possible. If travelling to these areas do not venture off well-used roads and paths and do not touch unknown metal objects.

### **Crime**

* Petty Crime is common in Laos, particularly in urban areas. Visitors should take sensible precautions at all times and especially during the summer peak travel period;
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport and original birth certificate (as well as travel insurance documents and other important documents) with family or friends at home;
* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together, leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place;
* Be aware that bag snatching occurs frequently and that there is a significant increase in theft in the lead up to local festivals;
* Avoid placing bags in the front basket of bicycles;
* Bag snatchers on motorbikes are also a problem;
* When travelling by air, bus or train, stay vigilant against petty theft, particularly in busy rail and bus stations and in crowded airports.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and do not leave your passport as a deposit or guarantee when hiring a motorcycle.

If your passport is lost or stolen, report this to the Police immediately and obtain a Police Report. Irish Citizens should be aware that if this occurs, it will delay your travel plans considerably, and cost you money. Along with the time taken to arrange a new travel document, you will subsequently need to get a replacement visa and an exit visa from immigration. This can take at least three working days and may delay your onward travel plans considerably.

If in Laos and your passport is lost or stolen please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Hanoi for assistance.

### **Contaminated Food or Drink**

There have been a number of incidents where tourists have had their drinks or food drugged. Some restaurants in popular tourist destinations offer drug-laced food and drink, which has led to the victim being assaulted. These products can contain harmful substances and consuming them can result in serious injury or even death. Never leave food or drink unattended.

There have been incidents of methanol poisoning in popular tourist spots in Laos, including Vang Vieng, leading to serious illness and some fatalities. Avoid drinking any homemade alcohol (e.g. rice wine), particularly spirits, and be careful of counterfeit bottled beer.

### **Date Rape Drugs**

There have been incidents of drug-related rapes reported by foreigners. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers and be wary at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Laos, report it to the local police immediately.

Police: 1191, 241162, 241163, 241164, and 212703.

Tourist Police: 021-251-128

Visitors can also contact the [**Irish Embassy in Hanoi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/vietnam/) if you need our assistance is required.

### **Public Transport**

Roads in Laos are generally in poor condition and vehicles are not maintained to EU/Irish standards. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident as roads are often unmarked and vehicles often do not have lights, are poorly maintained and are overcrowded and overweight. Along with livestock straying onto roads these are regular causes of accidents in Laos, especially during the rainy season.

The number of road accidents and fatalities, particularly at night and involving motorcycles, has risen sharply in recent years. Travel should be undertaken only during daylight hours.

Exercise a high degree of caution if considering using an overnight bus during your time in Laos and be aware of the risk of being involved in a serious road accident.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Laos, visitors should be extremely careful. The number of road accidents in Laos has risen sharply in recent years along with the increase in the number of motor vehicles, especially motorbikes. Most roads in Laos are in very poor condition and visitors should only travel during daylight hours.

If visitors want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driver's licence and your international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance;
* Be aware that vehicles often do not have lights and livestock tend to stray on to the roads.

If involved in a road accident you will have to pay compensation for third party property damage and injury, even if you are not at fault. As a general rule, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.

Visitors can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Water Safety**

Be extremely cautious if planning any river-based sporting activities, particularly in Vang Vieng. Tourists have been killed or seriously injured while taking part in activities such as tubing or jumping into the river. Visitors should carefully consider their personal safety and take appropriate precautions.

### **Mekong River**

Travel on the Mekong River by speedboat is dangerous, especially during the dry season, and we advise visitors to wear life-vests and crash helmets. River levels can vary during the year and the presence of debris in the river can make diving or jumping into the river dangerous.

### **Health and Safety Requirements**

Visitors should also be aware that the health and safety requirements in Laos are nowhere near as stringent as in Ireland, and are often neither observed nor enforced. Therefore, the risk of a serious or fatal accident in the course of these activities is much higher than it would be in Ireland.

### **Insurance**

Before taking part in any water-based sports or activities, including inner-tubing, please check that your travel insurance will cover you in the event of death or injury to yourself or a third party. In the event of an accident, even where you are not at fault, you are likely to be required to pay compensation for third party injury/damage.
