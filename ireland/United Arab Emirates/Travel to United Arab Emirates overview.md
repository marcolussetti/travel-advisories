#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi, or nearest Consulate, for advice.

Please contact the [**Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Security**](https://icp.gov.ae/en/contact-us/) to check your travel ban status in the UAE.

The UAE is a Muslim country, with a very diverse resident population. Laws and customs are very different to those in Ireland and other Western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in the UAE. Please note that if visitors experience any legal difficulty, either civil or criminal, while in the UAE, they are likely to be subject to a travel ban until the issue is fully resolved. Timings related to the resolution of legal issues are not consistent and may not be prompt. See the Local Laws and Customs section for more information.

Visitors to the UAE are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens are encouraged to follow the Embassy of Ireland, Abu Dhabi on social media ([**X**](https://x.com/IrelandEmbUAE), [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandEmbUAE/)**,** [**Instagram**](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiU7NrMpM2LAxUTQUEAHV2POlgQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Firelandembuae%2F%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AOvVaw3lH1PDscX4yD-bMNp6pdBp&opi=89978449)**, and** [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/embassy-of-ireland-abu-dhabi?originalSubdomain=ae)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
