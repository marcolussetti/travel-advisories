### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens can get 30-day visit visas upon entry to the UAE.

A valid passport is required for travel to the UAE. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used for entry to the UAE.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

The UAE is a Muslim country, yet with a very diverse resident population. Laws and customs are very different to those in Ireland and other Western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in the UAE. There can be serious penalties, including custodial sentences, for doing something that may not be illegal in Ireland. Please note that if visitors experience any legal difficulty, either civil or criminal, while in the UAE, they are likely to be subject to a travel ban until the issue is fully resolved. Timings related to the resolution of legal issues are not consistent and may not be prompt. See the Local Laws and Customs section.

Visitors to the UAE are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy of Ireland, Abu Dhabi on social media (Twitter[**@IrelandEmbUAE**](https://twitter.com/IrelandEmbUAE) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandEmbUAE/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

**Important Information**

**Please note that in the UAE defaulting on the repayment of loans or bills is taken extremely seriously. A criminal case is often filed resulting in a travel ban. Individuals in such circumstances are not permitted to travel outside the UAE. Ensure that any personal debt is fully paid before you leave the UAE. Failure to do so may impact your ability to transit through the UAE in the future.**

**Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand. If visitors encounter minor problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management. Please note that if you misplace your passport while in the UAE, there is a very good chance it will be handed into lost and found. Please retrace your steps and contact the relevant authorities (e.g., restaurants, hotels, taxi companies etc.). If unable to find your misplaced passport, please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in the UAE by dialling 999. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 999
* Fire brigade: 997
