The UAE is a Muslim country, with a very diverse resident population. Laws and customs are very different to those in Ireland and other Western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in the UAE. Please note that if visitors experience any legal difficulty, either civil or criminal, while in the UAE, they are likely to be subject to a travel ban until the issue is fully resolved. Timings related to the resolution of legal issues are not consistent and may not be prompt. See the Local Laws and Customs section for more information.

Visitors to the UAE are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
