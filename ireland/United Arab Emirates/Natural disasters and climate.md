## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

The UAE has an arid desert climate characterised by extremely hot summers, with temperatures often exceeding 45Â°C, and mild winters. Rainfall is scarce and sporadic while humidity levels can be high, especially in coastal areas.

### **Sandstorms**

Sandstorms in the UAE are common, especially during the summer, when strong winds lift dust and sand, reducing visibility and air quality. These storms can occasionally disrupt travel and daily activities

### **Flooding**

While rainfall is scarce and sporadic in the UAE, in recent years there have been some heavy rains between October and April across the UAE. This can lead to serious flooding that has resulted in major disruption and severe damage to property. Roads may be impassable due to flooding.

During this period you should regularly check local weather forecasts and local media reporting, and to take appropriate precautions.
