## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

The UAE is hot and dry most of the year.Â Drink plenty of water but remember that during Ramadan it is an offence to eat or drink in public between sunrise and sunset.

### **Sandstorms**

There are occasional sandstorms but they are not usually bad enough to affect daily life.

### **Flooding**

In some parts of the country, particularly in the mountains, occasional heavy rain can cause flash floods. Take precautions and seek out local advice.
