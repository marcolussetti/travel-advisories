## Local laws and customs

### **Muslim culture**

The UAE is an Islamic country and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

Dress conservatively, particularly in Sharjah and Ajman emirates, where Islamic law is rigorously enforced. Clothes should cover the tops of the arms and legs and underwear should not be visible.

Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public. Sex outside of marriage is illegal, as is cohabitation, adultery and homosexual behaviour. If you conduct a sexual relationship outside heterosexual marriage you run the risk of prosecution, imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation. Private life is respected in the UAE, however people are punished for sexual activity outside marriage where there is a public element or if it is brought to the attention of the police authorities.

If you become pregnant outside marriage, both you and your partner could face imprisonment and/or deportation. Doctors may ask for proof of marriage during ante-natal checks. An unmarried woman who gives birth in the UAE may also encounter problems when registering the birth of the child in the UAE, and could face arrest, imprisonment or deportation. To obtain a birth certificate from the UAE authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate and the authorities may compare the date of the marriage against the estimated date of conception.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Forbidden products**

Bringing drugs, pork products and pornographic books and material into the UAE is forbidden. Videos, books and magazines are subject to scrutiny and may be censored.

### **Prescription medications**

Prescription medicines are tightly controlled in the UAE. Medications available over the counter or by prescription in Ireland, such as codeine may be illegal or considered a controlled substance in the UAE. Carefully consult the [**UAE Ministry of Health**](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/issue-of-permit-to-import-medicines-for-personal-use) guidelines before travelling to the UAE to see if your medication is on the list of controlled or prohibited substances. If in doubt consult with a doctor or pharmacist.

If your medication is on the controlled drugs list approval will required to bring it into the UAE. You can apply for [**online approval**](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/issue-of-permit-to-import-medicines-for-personal-use) prior to travel or on arrival in the airport in the UAE. Online approvals can take up to five working days following completion of the online application. You will require the original prescription and an attested medical report and will only be permitted to carry up to 30 days’ supply. If you arrive in the UAE without prior approval or the required documentation for approval on entry, the medication will not be allowed into the UAE and you may be prosecuted under UAE law. Even if you do not bring such medications with you to the UAE, local authorities may prosecute you if blood and urine tests detect traces of a prohibited substance in your system.

Other medicines not on the controlled list may be brought into the UAE but always carry the original prescription and not more than three months’ supply. Medicines should be in the original packaging and should not have expired.  Some herbal remedies may be restricted or prohibited. Cannabidiol oil or CBD oil is considered an illegal drug in the UAE and there have a number of arrests for possession, including traces in vaping devices, at border entry points. Possession carries a minimum sentence of two years but for larger quantities can be ten years or more.  Further information on controlled medicines and permissions can be obtained directly from the [**UAE Ministry of Health**](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/issue-of-permit-to-import-medicines-for-personal-use) by emailing [**info@moh.gov.ae**](mailto:info@moh.gov.ae) or calling +971 2 652 0500.

### **Criminal offences**

Financial crimes, including fraud, bouncing cheques and the non-payment of bills, is regarded very seriously in the UAE and can often result in imprisonment and/or a fine. Non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for crimes involving fraud do not generally get bail. Convicted debtors will not usually be released from jail until the debt is paid or waived. Several Irish citizens have received custodial sentences as a result of non-payment of outstanding debts.

Swearing and making rude gestures (including online) are considered obscene acts and can lead to prosecution. Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.

Protesting is illegal in the UAE. Anyone breaking the law in the UAE is likely to be taken into custody and a travel ban applied.

### **Women travellers**

### **LGBT**

Homosexual activity is illegal in the UAE.

### **Alcohol**

Liquor licences can be obtained by non-Muslim residents to consume alcohol in private homes and licensed hotels and clubs. Tourists in Dubai can apply for a temporary liquor licence through one of the official distributers of alcohol in Dubai. Liquor licences are only valid in the Emirate in which they are issued. Liquor licences are not available to non-residents in the other Emirates, but it is possible for tourists and visitors to buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs. Drinking alcohol in the Emirate of Sharjah is illegal. It is a punishable offence under UAE law to drink alcohol or to be drunk in public. Passengers in transit through the UAE under the influence of alcohol may also be arrested.

### **Illegal drugs**

The penalties for drug trafficking, smuggling and possession are severe. Drug trafficking penalties can include the death sentence or life imprisonment. The presence of drugs in the body constitutes possession and carries a minimum sentence of four years.

Travellers who transit in UAE airports are subject to these laws. UAE airports have excellent technology and security, so transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested.

Weapons, ammunition and gun belts etc. all require permission for entry or transit through the UAE.
