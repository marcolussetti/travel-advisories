### **Entry & exit requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens can obtain a free 30 day visa waiver on arrival in UAE. Passports should be valid for a minimum remaining period of six months to enter the UAE. If you hold a UAE residence permit, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months in order to travel into the country.

If unsure of what the entry requirements for the UAE are, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of the UAE.

For non-residents, Irish temporary passports are not valid for entry into the United Arab Emirates. However, temporary passports are accepted for airside transit and exit from the United Arab Emirates.

Visitors must have legal status in the UAE when they depart. If your residency visa is under process, you have overstayed your visa, are involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt or are a child subject to a custody dispute, you may be prevented from leaving the country. A number of Irish nationals have been arrested when departing or transiting the UAE, including as a result of unpaid debts in the country.
