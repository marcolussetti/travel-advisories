## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

There are ongoing regional tensions and, in the event of any incidents, you should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. The domestic political situation in the UAE is generally stable.

### **Terrorism**

Visitors should be aware that there is a degree of threat from terrorism across the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and against Western interests, as they have been elsewhere in the region. The last terrorist attack in the UAE was in 2022.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in the UAE but take sensible precautions. If you are a victim of a crime while in the UAE, report it to the police immediately. You can also contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/) if you need further assistance.

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. UAE law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the attacker was known to the victim. Drink spiking can occur. Do not accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.

### **Social Media and Photography**

The UAE enforces strict laws governing online behaviour. Comments, posts, or private messages made via social media can lead to criminal charges. Defamatory or insulting remarks, or the invasion of privacy by sharing photos, videos, or recordings without consent - even in public settings - are criminal offences. These can result in fines ranging from AED 150,000 to AED 500,000 and imprisonment. You could face up to 3 years in prison for defamation or insults, while sharing someone’s photo or video without permission could lead to at least 6 months in prison, or up to one year if the content is edited to cause harm. Visitors should also stay away from military sites – taking photos of military, diplomatic, or security installations, and some public buildings is prohibited. Refrain from filming or photographing people without their permission.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in the UAE, exercise caution. Road safety standards are mixed, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by speeding, poor driving, and inadequate lighting.

Drivers involved in an accident causing injuries may be detained until the injured parties are released from hospital. In an accident causing injuries or fatalities, those found at fault may be legally required to provide financial compensation to the injured party or the family of the deceased.

Visitors should exercise great care as a pedestrian and only cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings. It is illegal to cross in other places. Take care when crossing, as drivers sometimes fail to stop for pedestrians at zebra crossings.

Excursions to the desert can be dangerous even if you’re in a properly equipped 4-wheel-drive vehicle. Always travel with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone. Leave a copy of your travel plans with relatives, friends, or where you are staying. If you join a tour for driving in the desert or quad-biking, make sure you go with a reputable company with adequate health and safety procedures. Always check that such activities are covered by your insurance.

If you want to drive:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* It is illegal to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount, and your insurance is likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident. The penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be severe.

Offensive gestures and bad language can lead to fines, incarceration, and deportation.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Water Safety**

Rip currents can occur at any beach and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea. Always comply with warning signs and only swim at approved beaches. Only swim at pools with a lifeguard in attendance, and always check and ensure that there are qualified lifeguards present if children are swimming as part of their school activities or at summer camps.

The safety of tourist boats may not be up to Irish standards. Ensure that life jackets are available for all passengers.
