## Safety and security

### **Political Stability/Unrest**

The political situation in Iceland is reasonably stable but there can be occasional outbreaks of social unrest.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Iceland is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Iceland but visitors should take sensible precautions. Petty crime and pickpocketing can occur, take special care of your belongings in busy places or popular tourist areas.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Ensure that your valuables are secure and do not leave your car unlocked.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Iceland, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact the Irish Embassy in Oslo if you need help.

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Dimmed headlights are mandatory at all times.
* Note that it is illegal to drive off-road in Iceland**.**

### **Highland Driving (F-Roads)**

Driving in the Highlands (F-roads) requires an appropriate 4x4 vehicle. F-roads can be challenging to drive on as they follow mountainous terrain and are often unpaved gravel roads or tracks. Some routes also require river crossings. Always cross rivers at a designated crossing point and avoid crossing rivers alone. If you are unsure about crossing, **do not cross** and turn around. Leaving the designated F-Road route is strictly forbidden.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
