Air travel to Iceland and operations at Keflavík International Airport remain unaffected. Travel to the airport and other cities in Iceland is also unaffected.

Visitors to the Blue Lagoon should be aware that access to the area may change at short notice. For information on access please check directly here: [**Seismic Activity | Blue Lagoon Iceland**](https://www.bluelagoon.com/seismic-activity)

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Iceland.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU/EEA. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Iceland. However, if citizens are staying for longer than three months, they are advised to register their presence with authorities via Registers Iceland (Þjóðskrá). Iceland is a part of the EEA, not an EU member state. However as an EU/EEA national you have the right to live, work and study in Iceland. To find out more visit the [**Registers Iceland website**](https://www.skra.is/english/people/change-of-address/moving-to-iceland/i-am-an-eea-efta-citizen/).

Visitors to Iceland are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbOslo**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbOslo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyNorway/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
