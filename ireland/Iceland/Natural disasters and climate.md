In recent years, there have been a series of eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula. While these eruption sites have sometimes been open to the public, visitors should be aware that they are usually in remote locations with limited or no facilities. The sites are not accessible by car and involve long distance hikes over varying terrain. Visitors should ensure to have the appropriate equipment and clothing for their trip. Weather conditions in the remote areas can change rapidly, it is important to carefully plan ahead. If the authorities deem the sites to be closed to the public, do not attempt to access the area.
