## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

The temperature in some areas can reach over 40 degrees Celsius in the summer months. Remember to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration and wear sun protection. Sand and dust storms can occur, particularly in desert areas.

### **Earthquake**

There are occasional earthquake tremors in Jordan. These may lead to rock falls and landslides. If you are travelling to or living in Jordan, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Flooding**

Drainage systems are poor, particularly on roads and highways. As a result of this driving becomes significantly more dangerous, even in Amman. During heavy rains flash flooding can occur and can often be damaging. The rainy season is typically from November until March. It is advised to follow local weather updates regularly, particularly during heavy rain.
