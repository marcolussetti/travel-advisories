## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as inappropriate, improper, hostile or maybe even illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Jordan is a conservative and predominantly Muslim society, and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religious. Dress conservatively outside of resorts (women’s clothes should cover their legs above the knees and upper arms and shoulders), be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intent to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. You should also be aware that during Ramadan there is an increased risk of unrest as people are irritable and the roads, especially in Amman, are significantly busier and subsequently more dangerous at peak hours.

### **Law Enforcement**

While you in Jordan, you are subject to local laws, including ones that may seem harsh by Irish standards. Parents in particular should be aware that local laws regarding custody, etc. of children are significantly different to those in force in Ireland.

If you’re involved in local legal matters, particularly with regard to family law, we strongly advise you to get professional legal advice.

### **LGBT**

Under Jordanian law, homosexuality is decriminalised, however, there remains significant social stigma and discrimination. Public displays of affection between same sex couples may lead to arrest and incarceration so caution and discretion are advised at all times.
