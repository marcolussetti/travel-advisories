## Travel to Jordan overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Please be advised that the three land border crossings between Jordan and Israel (Allenby /King Hussein Bridge, Jordan River/ Sheikh Hussein Crossing, and Yitzhak Rabin / Wadi Araba Crossing) continue to be affected by long delays, reduced hours, and unforeseen closures without prior notification.

Given ongoing regional tensions, airlines may choose to suspend flights and/or adjust their schedules to and from Jordan at short notice. If you plan on flying to or from the region in the coming days, please check your flight status with your airline directly in advance of travelling.

In general, travellers to Jordan should exercise a high degree of caution, monitor local media, and **follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.** Where there are road closures, seek alternate routes, and avoid all demonstrations and large crowds. If you find yourself in immediate danger, please contact the Jordanian police by dialling 911.

We recommend that all Irish citizens travelling to or residing in Jordan register on our [**Citizens Registration portal**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Jordan. This can be purchased online in advance via the [**Jordan Pass**](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) website, or on arrival to Jordan at the port of entry. It costs 40 Jordanian dinars and is valid for one month.

A valid passport is required for travel to Jordan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months validity. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry Requirements tab. Please also note that, as of 01 October 2025, there are further requirements for visitors to register their place of residence if they remain in Jordan for more than two weeks for purposes other than tourism.

Visitors to Jordan are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@irlembjordan**](https://twitter.com/irlembjordan) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irlembjordan)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**
