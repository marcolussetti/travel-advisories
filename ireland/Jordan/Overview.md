## Overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Latest Travel Alert**

Please be advised that since 7 October 2023, a state of emergency has been in place across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory and this remains the case. As a result, the three land border crossings into Jordan (Allenby /King Hussein Bridge, Jordan River/ Sheikh Hussein Crossing and Yitzhak Rabin / Arava Crossing) may be affected by long delays, reduced hours, and unforeseen closures without prior notification.

In addition, flights have been disrupted on a number of occasions and we advise all travellers to and from Jordan to check with airlines in advance of travel.

Travellers to Jordan should exercise a high degree of caution, monitor local media, and **follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.** Where there are road closures, seek alternate routes, and avoid all demonstrations and large crowds. If you find yourself in immediate danger, please contact the Jordanian police by dialling 911.

In response to ongoing events, large-scale protests and demonstrations have occurred more frequently across Jordan, particularly in the capital, Amman. Demonstrations can be spontaneous and are often met with road closures and a heavy security presence.

We recommend that all Irish citizens travelling to or residing in Jordan register on the our [Citizens Registration portal](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Jordan. This can be purchased online in advance via the [**Jordan Pass**](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) website, or on arrival to Jordan at the port of entry.

A valid passport is required for travel to Jordan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months validity. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.
