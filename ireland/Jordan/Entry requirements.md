## Entry requirements

### Passport

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Jordan.

### **Visa**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Jordan. Tourist visas can be purchased on arrival at the airport (Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, or at Aqaba Airport) for 40 Jordanian Dinar. These visas are valid for one month and can be extended for up to 3 months at a local police station. Visas can also be obtained from the Honorary Consul of Jordan in Dublin, or you may wish to purchase a [Jordan Pass](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) online in advance.

If you are visiting Jordan for purposes other than tourism, such as for work or study, you must apply for your visa in advance online. As of 01 October 2025, if you are planning to stay in Jordan for more than 14 days, you must report to the residency extension office at your nearest police station. Failure to report will result in a fine of JOD 200 to be paid upon leaving the country. This does not apply to holders of annual residency visas, tourists, pilgrims, or transit-visa holders.

### **Regional Travel**

Travel between Jordan and Israel remains possible but the wider regional situation means that border crossings are subjected to long delays, added checks and unforeseen closures. If you travel to Israel, you may experience difficulties or be refused entry to some other countries in the region if your passport has evidence of travel to Israel. This includes entry and exist stamps issued at the border crossing in Jordan, or if your luggage has stickers indicating you have been to Israel.
