## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Jordan. Tourist visas can be purchased on arrival at the airport (Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, or at Aqaba airport in the south) for 40 JOD. These are valid for one month and can be extended for up to 3 months at a local police station. Visas can also be obtained from the Honorary Consul of Jordan in Dublin.

### Passport

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Jordan.

### **Regional Travel**

Travel between Jordan and Israel remains possible but the wider regional situation means that border crossings are subjected to long delays, added checks and unforeseen closures. If you travel to Israel, you may experience difficulties or be refused entry to some other countries in the region if your passport has evidence of travel to Israel. This includes entry and exist stamps issued at the border crossing in Jordan, or if your luggage has stickers indicating you have been to Israel.
