### **Lost Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Nigeria**](/en/nigeria/abuja/) . We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
