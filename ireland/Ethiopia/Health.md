## Health

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Ethiopia.

### **Medical Facilities**

Although there are hospitals in all major towns in Ethiopia, facilities and the supply of medicines are extremely poor even in the larger towns outside Addis Ababa. Make sure you have adequate medical insurance, which covers medical evacuation by air ambulance, before arrival.

Almost all regional hospitals will be unable to treat serious injuries or illnesses adequately. In the most serious cases, even the medical facilities in Addis Ababa may not be adequate. It may be worthwhile to carry a comprehensive medical pack if travelling or living outside Addis Ababa for an extended period.

### **Polio**

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk.

Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website.**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/polio/guidance/)

### **Waterborne Diseases**

Waterborne diseases are common in Ethiopia and it is advisable to either boil water before drinking, or use bottled water. Since water boils at temperatures below 100 degrees centigrade at high altitudes, boiling may not be adequate to ensure sterilisation in some places. Bilharzia is common in most lakes in Ethiopia; check before going swimming.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is common in areas of the country below 1,800 metres or so. In the northern tourist circuit, most towns are well above this altitude. However, Bahir Dar is at an altitude of 1850 metres, and does experience cases of malaria.

Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. On arrival, take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes. Be aware that the full range of anti-malarial medications, which can be purchased in Ireland, is not available in Ethiopia.

### **Rabies**

Stray dogs are common in Addis Ababa and across Ethiopia. We recommend seeking advice from your doctor on rabies vaccination.
