## Local laws and customs

Irish citizens should be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices in Ethiopia as one’s behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim and Christian society**

Both Muslim and Christian Ethiopians generally dress in a conservative manner. In most, but not all, Ethiopian Orthodox churches there are restrictions on full or partial access for women - notices are usually posted in English at the entrances of the main churches that tourists frequent.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Western and Julian Calendars**

The western and Julian calendars are used in Ethiopia. The Julian calendar runs seven to eight years behind the western calendar Christmas is celebrated on 7 January and New Year on 11 September.

Similarly, two systems of time are used. Ethiopian time is measured as a 12-hour day starting at 6am. Western 7am is referred to by many as one o’clock. Many Ethiopians are aware of this difference and will often convert times when speaking to foreigners.

### **Exporting Antiques**

A permit is required to export antiques from Ethiopia. To avoid confusion on departure, keep receipts for any souvenirs bought, including crosses, which could be mistaken for valuable cultural artefacts.

In Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you can fill in the customs declaration form in the baggage hall.

### **Photography**

Ethiopian law strictly prohibits the photographing of military installations, police/military personnel, industrial facilities, government buildings, and infrastructure (roads, bridges, dams, airfields, etc.). Such sites are rarely marked clearly. Travel guides, police, and Ethiopian officials can advise if a particular site may be photographed. Photographing prohibited sites may result in the confiscation of film/camera and arrest.

### **Money**

Ethiopia is primarily a cash economy. Dollars and some of the more popular travellers’ checks can be changed at the airport, and at some banks. Banking facilities are very limited outside of Addis Ababa, and as such travellers outside the capital should ensure they have an adequate supply of cash before departing.

### **ATMs**

There are some ATM machines at the major hotels and commercial centres that accept major international credit and debit cards, although connectivity problems sometimes limit their availability. While credit cards are gaining acceptance with some hotels, travel agencies, and merchants (Visa is much more widely accepted than Mastercard), it is best to check ahead and ensure you have sufficient cash reserves. Bear in mind that travellers’ cheques are not generally accepted outside Addis Ababa.

There are strict rules about taking foreign currency and Ethiopian Birr out of Ethiopia. You cannot take more than USD$3,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) out of Ethiopia, unless you declared the amount when you arrived in the country or you have an Ethiopian bank advice certifying the purchase of the foreign currency. You cannot take more than 3,000 Ethiopian Birr in to or out of the country.

Amounts over 3,000 Ethiopian Birr, or undeclared amounts over USD$3,000 may be confiscated by the Ethiopian authorities.

In case of emergency, Western Union have offices in Ethiopia, which can facilitate money transfers.
