## Local laws and customs

Irish citizens should be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices in Ethiopia as one’s behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Ethiopia. Visas are available as an eVisa online. Visa on arrival services are available for tourism visas only, but Irish citizens entering Ethiopia for tourism purposes are encouraged to obtain the appropriate visa before they travel to facilitate smoother entry into Ethiopia. Other visa types of visa should be applied for online in advance.

A valid passport is required for travel to Ethiopia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months and 2 blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

The e-visa can be obtained from [**www.evisa.gov.et**](http://www.evisa.gov.et/). This is the official government website. Please be aware that there are a number of unofficial websites charging additional fees to apply for the visa on your behalf. Irish citizens entering Ethiopia should allow additional time for the processing of e-visa applications as there may be delays.

Visa on arrival services can only be paid in US Dollars at the point of entry into Ethiopia.

Travelers who transit through Bole international Airport do not require a transit visa if they remain in the permitted transit area and depart within 12 hours.

It is currently possible to extend e-visas, though the Embassy understands these are being granted only in a limited number of circumstances. It is best to apply for an extension in good time in order to avoid the risk of overstay. Current visa extension fees are 100% of the initial visa fee for a first time one-month extension, 150% of the initial visa fee for a second time 15 day extension, and 200% for a third time 10 day extension. Full details on visa extensions can be found [**here**](https://www.evisa.gov.et/visa-extension-description). Travellers whose entry visa expires before they depart Ethiopia must obtain a visa extension through the Main Immigration Office in Addis Ababa. Currently, there is an overstay penalty fee of $10 a day, which must be paid before leaving Ethiopia. Travellers overstaying their visas may be detained by immigration officials and/or required to appear in immigration court, and may be subject to additional fines.

Travellers coming from areas where Yellow Fever is endemic must be vaccinated against the disease, and will be asked to provide proof in the form a WHO-approved yellow vaccination booklet.

### **Muslim and Christian society**

Both Muslim and Christian Ethiopians generally dress in a conservative manner. In most, but not all, Ethiopian Orthodox churches there are restrictions on full or partial access for women - notices are usually posted in English at the entrances of the main churches that tourists frequent.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Western and Julian calendars**

The western and Julian calendars are used in Ethiopia. The Julian calendar runs seven to eight years behind the western calendar Christmas is celebrated on 7 January and New Year on 11 September.

Similarly, two systems of time are used. Ethiopian time is measured as a 12-hour day starting at 6am. Western 7am is referred to by many as one o’clock. Many Ethiopians are aware of this difference and will often convert times when speaking to foreigners.

### **Exporting antiques**

A permit is required to export antiques from Ethiopia. To avoid confusion on departure, keep receipts for any souvenirs bought, including crosses, which could be mistaken for valuable cultural artefacts.

In Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you can fill in the customs declaration form in the baggage hall.

### **Photography**

Ethiopian law strictly prohibits the photographing of military installations, police/military personnel, industrial facilities, government buildings, and infrastructure (roads, bridges, dams, airfields, etc.). Such sites are rarely marked clearly. Travel guides, police, and Ethiopian officials can advise if a particular site may be photographed. Photographing prohibited sites may result in the confiscation of film/camera and arrest.

### **Money**

Ethiopia is primarily a cash economy. Dollars and some of the more popular travellers’ checks can be changed at the airport, and at some banks. Banking facilities are very limited outside of Addis Ababa, and as such travellers outside the capital should ensure they have an adequate supply of cash before departing.

### **ATMs**

There are some ATM machines at the major hotels and commercial centres that accept major international credit and debit cards, although connectivity problems sometimes limit their availability. While credit cards are gaining acceptance with some hotels, travel agencies, and merchants (Visa is much more widely accepted than Mastercard), it is best to check ahead and ensure you have sufficient cash reserves. Bear in mind that travellers’ cheques are not generally accepted outside Addis Ababa.

There are strict rules about taking foreign currency and Ethiopian Birr out of Ethiopia. You cannot take more than USD$3,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) out of Ethiopia, unless you declared the amount when you arrived in the country or you have an Ethiopian bank advice certifying the purchase of the foreign currency. You cannot take more than 3,000 Ethiopian Birr in to or out of the country.

Amounts over 3,000 Ethiopian Birr, or undeclared amounts over USD$3,000 may be confiscated by the Ethiopian authorities.

In case of emergency, Western Union have offices in Ethiopia, which can facilitate money transfers.
