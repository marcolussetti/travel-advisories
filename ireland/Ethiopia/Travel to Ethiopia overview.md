### **Details**

### **Amhara**

The Embassy recommends against all travel to Amhara Regional State as the region has seen active and ongoing armed conflict between local FANO militia groups and the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) in both urban and rural areas since mid-2023. Conflict is dynamic and unpredictable, with large cities like Gondar and Bahir Dar and tourist sites including Lalibela periodically becoming contested sites with active shooting and artillery fire. Communications and electricity outages are widespread and air and road transport disruptions, including informal roadblocks, are common and unpredictable. Travellers in the region are at significant risk of being caught up in violence. Any Irish citizens in Amhara region should make plans to leave the region if it is safe to do so.

### **Tigray**

The Cessation of Hostilities Agreement signed in November 2022 ended the large-scale fighting in Tigray. Nonetheless there continues to be reports of sporadic and indiscriminate violence particularly in the disputed of territory of Western Tigray and the Raya area of southern Tigray, but also elsewhere in the region, including in major urban centres such as Mekelle.

### **Addis Ababa**

Addis Ababa is currently calm from a security perspective. However, citizens should exercise a high degree of caution, monitor local media and avoid any signs of demonstration. Irish citizens both resident in and visiting Addis should carry copies of identification at all times.

There has been an increase in petty crime in Addis Ababa, in particular street robbery and muggings. These incidents can turn violent. Be wary of distraction techniques while on the street, such as youth grabbing onto your person or offering things to you. Remain cautious when walking around the city, particularly if alone or after dark. While driving, ensure that doors are locked and windows are raised. If you are threatened, you should hand over any valuables without resistance.

There have also been reports of luggage theft and stealing of valuables in Addis Ababa Bole Airport, including in transport from the airport. Travellers should arrange official airport transport with their hotel and ensure they keep their luggage and valuables in sight at all times. Theft of valuables has also been reported at security screening on entry to the airport. All valuables should be placed inside luggage before screening.

Festivals and celebrations are held frequently in Addis Ababa throughout the year. Large crowds can gather, particularly around the Meskel Square area. Exercise caution around large gatherings, as these events can be targets for opportunistic crime (particularly pickpocketing).

### **Oromia**

Due to clashes between armed groups and security forces, inter-communal violence and militia activity, all travel to western Oromia should be avoided, including Nekemte, West Wellega, East Wellega and Kelem Wellega zones. You should also avoid all travel to the East and West Guji and Gedeo zones (on the border between Oromia and South Ethiopia regions) due to civil unrest and armed clashes.

There have been a number of instances of kidnapping for ransom in Oromia region. These have targeted Ethiopian nationals and foreign nationals. Travel by road should be minimised; travellers are encouraged to travel between regions by air to the greatest degree possible.

Irish citizens travelling on the A1 road from Addis Ababa to Bishoftu should exercise a high degree of caution. Travel along this road at night is discouraged due to the possibility of roadblocks or attacks on vehicles.

Irish citizens planning to travel elsewhere within Oromia region should seek security advice from local contacts in advance of travel. Irish citizens should also minimise road transportation when possible due to risk of impromptu road blocks and checkpoints.

### **Afar**

The embassy is aware of reports of attacks on goods vehicles and trucks moving along the A1 road from Djibouti to Addis Ababa. Driving at night on this road should be avoided.

Tensions in the border zones between Afar and Somali regions can give rise to unrest and violence.

### **Southern Regions**

Border areas with Kenya and South Sudan can be volatile and should be avoided. If travelling in southern and south-western Ethiopia, you should exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Somali Region**

Serious confrontations between ethnic groups have taken place along the Oromia-Somali and Afar-Somali borders, resulting in the mass displacement of people. Caution is advised along border areas with other regional states. All travel to the international border with Somalia should be avoided.

Al-Shabaab has a history of terrorist activity along the border regions with Somalia in Somali Regional State. The recent tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia have reportedly been used to drive recruitment for the group, and the local security situation is unpredictable. Travellers to Somali regional state should remain vigilant at all times and are advised to seek specific advice in advance of travel.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Ethiopia by dialling:

* Emergency: 911
* Police: 991
* Ambulance (in Addis Ababa): 907
