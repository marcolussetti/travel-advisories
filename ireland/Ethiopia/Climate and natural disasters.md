## Climate and natural disasters

### **Practical advice**

* If travelling to Ethiopia, make sure you know what to expect – then plan and pack so that you are prepared
* Get local advice on how to manage in the case of a serious incident or dangerous conditions
* Co-operate with local authorities and emergency services in the case of serious incidents
* The rainy season in Ethiopia lasts from May to September. During this time, some areas, particularly in the Southern Region, can be prone to mudslides. Check with local contacts in advance of travel.

### **Seismic Activity**

Ethiopia can experience high levels of seismic and volcanic activity. Updates on earthquakes and seismic activities can be monitored on the [**Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS).**](https://gdacs.org/) Irish citizens in Ethiopia are advised to familiarise themselves with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. This can include identifying a room that can be used as a shelter following an earthquake as well as having an emergency supply kit and closed-toed shoes within reach of one’s bed. Irish citizens may also consult the [**Red Cross**](https://www.ifrc.org/our-work/disasters-climate-and-crises/what-disaster/earthquakes), which provides comprehensive information on how to respond after an earthquake. Irish citizens should follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media should a major earthquake occur in Ethiopia.

### **Altitude**

Some people find it hard to adjust to the altitude in the Ethiopian highlands and need to avoid over-exertion.

Irish citizens should be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices in Ethiopia as one’s behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.
