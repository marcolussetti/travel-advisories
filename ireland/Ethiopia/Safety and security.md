## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is a threat from terrorism in Ethiopia and security is tight in most hotels, shopping centres, and other public places. Irish citizens are reminded to maintain a high level of security awareness at all times: avoid crowds, review your personal safety, remain vigilant and be cautious when frequenting prominent public places and landmarks.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Ethiopia but muggings and armed assaults are on the rise, especially in Addis Ababa. While violent crime, particularly against foreigners, is unusual, it is not unheard of. Crime increases significantly after dark and it is not advisable to walk unaccompanied in Addis Ababa or elsewhere after nightfall. Please take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together – leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag snatching from vehicles stopped at traffic lights
* Be alert when calling or texting on your mobile phone it is best not to do this on the street. Violent muggings have occurred over mobile phones worth less than €20 in Ireland.
* Be vigilant if approached by strangers seeking assistance – criminal gangs are known to use distraction techniques including begging, grabbing your arm, spitting or spilling food/drink on you or feigning illness.
* Keep belongings on your person while travelling in taxis, and keep valuables like cameras and passports out of sight.
* There have been reports of scams involving a person hiding in the back or the boot of a taxi from the airport to hotels and stealing valuables from baggage placed in the back seat. When travelling in taxis, sitting in the back seat is recommended. If a taxi driver insists on you sitting in the front seat, try to find another taxi. Be particularly vigilant where they insist on baggage being in the back seat while you sit in the front.

### **Petty Theft**

Bag snatching and pick pocketing are most common in areas frequented by foreigners such as the Piazza, Mercato, Bole and Churchill Road areas of Addis Ababa. Be especially watchful for pickpockets when getting out of taxis in these areas. Be aware of groups attempting to distract you while others pick your pockets.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Ethiopia, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the [**Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/ethiopia/addisababa/) if you need help.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexual activity is illegal and the subject is taboo for the majority of Ethiopians. There has been an increase in anti-LGBT rhetoric from authorities in Ethiopia and displays of affection in public are likely to attract unwanted attention.

### **Social unrest**

The political situation across Ethiopia can be volatile. Public and civil protests are frequent and can turn violent without warning. Universities can be hotspots for ethnically motivated violence. If intending to visit a university during your stay, please seek the advice of your university contacts.

We advise to avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational. Always keep yourself informed by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Ethiopia, be aware that road safety standards are low and you need to be extremely careful while driving or walking on roads. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Ethiopia has the highest rate of traffic fatalities per vehicle in the world. We advise against travelling by road outside towns and cities after dark, due to the increased risk of road accidents and reports of targeting of vehicles by armed groups in some parts of the country.

Roads in Ethiopia are poorly maintained, inadequately marked and poorly lit. Road travel after dark outside Addis Ababa and other cities is dangerous and discouraged due to hazards posed by broken-down vehicles left in the road, pedestrians walking in the road, stray animals, and the possibility of armed robbery. Excessive speed, unpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians and livestock in the roadway, and the lack of adherence to basic safety standards for vehicles are daily hazards on Ethiopian roads.

If travelling by taxi, it is advised to only use the yellow metered taxis or ordered through a taxi app, as these generally have higher standards of maintenance than the blue and white taxis. Please ensure to always wear a seat belt when travelling in a taxi.

It is unlawful to use a cell phone or other electronic communications device while driving in Ethiopia (even if it has a hands-free feature), and use of seat belts is required. Be sure to carry a valid driver's license, as well as proof of comprehensive local insurance coverage. While in a vehicle, **keep doors locked and the windows rolled up at all times**. Keep bags, purses, and valuables out of sight — in the trunk, on the floor, or in the glove compartment. Do not carry unnecessary items in your bag; leave credit cards etc., at home. Do not open doors or windows to give to beggars. Police can fine people for giving money to beggars.

If you want to drive:

* Ensure that you apply for and bring an [**International Driving Permit from the AA**](https://www.theaa.ie/motoring-advice/driving-in-europe/international-driving-permit/) and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* If intending to use your Irish driving licence to apply for an Ethiopian driving licence, your driving licence must be authenticated by a notary public/ the National Driver Licence Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin before travelling.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Be aware of Ethiopia's traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Wear seatbelts at all times
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* If you encounter roadblocks or checkpoints while driving, follow the advice of the local authorities present. If the roadblock or checkpoint is unattended, turn around and not attempt to pass it.

### **Traffic accidents**

If your vehicle comes into contact with another, make sure that valuables are secure before getting out of the vehicle and lock doors to prevent theft while not in the vehicle. The Traffic Police will come to assess the scene and mark the location of the incident.

If there is a dispute at the scene, try to remain calm, do not engage physically, and try to take note of the other driver's name, licence plate, description, etc. If a crowd assembles, stay in your car and wait for the police to arrive.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
