## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Ethiopia. Visas are available as an eVisa online. Visa on arrival services are available for tourism visas only, but Irish citizens entering Ethiopia for tourism purposes are encouraged to obtain the appropriate visa before they travel to facilitate smoother entry into Ethiopia. Other visa types of visa should be applied for online in advance.

The e-visa can be obtained from [**www.evisa.gov.et**](http://www.evisa.gov.et/). This is the official government website. Please be aware that there are a number of unofficial websites charging additional fees to apply for the visa on your behalf. Irish citizens entering Ethiopia should allow additional time for the processing of e-visa applications as there may be delays.

Visa on arrival services can only be paid in US Dollars at the point of entry into Ethiopia.

Travelers who transit through Bole international Airport do not require a transit visa if they remain in the permitted transit area and depart within 12 hours.

It is currently possible to extend e-visas, though the Embassy understands these are being granted only in a limited number of circumstances. It is best to apply for an extension in good time in order to avoid the risk of overstay. Current visa extension fees are 100% of the initial visa fee for a first time one-month extension, 150% of the initial visa fee for a second time 15 day extension, and 200% for a third time 10 day extension. Full details on visa extensions can be found [**here**](https://www.evisa.gov.et/visa-extension-description). Travellers whose entry visa expires before they depart Ethiopia must obtain a visa extension through the Main Immigration Office in Addis Ababa. Currently, there is an overstay penalty fee of $10 a day, which must be paid before leaving Ethiopia. Travellers overstaying their visas may be detained by immigration officials and/or required to appear in immigration court, and may be subject to additional fines.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Ethiopia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months and 2 blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

### **Yellow Fever Vaccination**

Travellers coming from areas where Yellow Fever is endemic must be vaccinated against the disease, and will be asked to provide proof in the form a WHO-approved yellow vaccination booklet.
