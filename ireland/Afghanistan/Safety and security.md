## Safety and security

#### **We advise against all travel to Afghanistan.**

**There is an extremely volatile security situation and a high risk of terrorist attacks and kidnapping.**

The security situation in Afghanistan is extremely grave and very unpredictable and the threat to Westerners from terrorist or criminal violence, including kidnappings, is high. Aid workers, tourists, journalists, and business travellers are all subject to targeted kidnapping attempts.

If you consider your presence in Afghanistan is essential, you should have adequate and continuous professional close security arrangements and ensure they are regularly reviewed.

You should stay in a reliable and well-secured environment.

### **Register**

If you’re going to be in Afghanistan for an extended length of time, we strongly advise you to make contact with the Irish Embassy in Islamabad. Take comprehensive precautions in case you are unable to return from Afghanistan as planned, for example, due to an attack, kidnapping, or accident.

### **Terrorism**

The threat from terrorism in Afghanistan is extremely high. Terrorist attacks in the form of bombings and armed attacks occur frequently. Attacks are often indiscriminate and may include civilian targets, and places frequented by expatriates are a particular target, including hotels and restaurants. Persons from Western countries are at high risk of hostage-taking or attack. The Taliban controls the country, including the capital Kabul. Armed groups such as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) continue to maintain a high level of activity in several places.

### **Crime**

You should take precautions against crime in Afghanistan, which is extensive. The volatile situation in the country is exploited by criminal actors and violent crime for profit is common. The production and trafficking of narcotics is a significant issue, and there is a significant risk of kidnapping for Western visitors.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Driving**

Afghanistan's traffic infrastructure is poorly developed, and large parts of the country are difficult to access. Traffic accidents occur frequently. Most road surfaces are in very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured.

If you want to drive despite this advice, bring your international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance. Please also note that outside of larger cities, there is only sporadic internet and mobile phone coverage.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
