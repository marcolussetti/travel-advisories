## Safety and security

#### **We advise against all travel to Afghanistan.**

**There is an extremely volatile security situation and a high risk of terrorist attacks.**

The security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating and the threat to Westerners from terrorist or criminal violence, including kidnappings, is high. Afghanistan is experiencing a major surge in COVID-19 infections with corresponding challenges for healthcare provision.

If you consider your presence in Afghanistan is essential, you should have adequate and continuous professional close security arrangements and ensure they are regularly reviewed.

### **Register**

If you’re going to be in Afghanistan for an extended length of time, we strongly advise you to make contact with the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi.

### **Terrorism**

The threat from terrorism in Afghanistan is extremely high. Attacks are often indiscriminate and may include civilian targets, including places frequented by expatriates.

### **Crime**

You should take sensible precautions against crime in Afghanistan:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Afghanistan, report it to the local police immediately.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Afghanistan, you should be extremely careful. Most road surfaces are in very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured.

If you want to drive, bring your international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
