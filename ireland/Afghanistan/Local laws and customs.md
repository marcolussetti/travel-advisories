## Local laws and customs

#### **We advise against all travel to Afghanistan.**

### Taliban Rule

The Taliban enforces a very strict set of decrees that govern public behaviour, media, dress and customs, particularly interactions between genders. The upmost care should be taken in all public behaviours in Afghanistan. Punishments for violations of these decrees can be very severe.

### **Muslim culture**

Afghanistan is a Muslim country in which Islamic law, customs and dress are universally respected. Local authorities will expect you to respect them at all times. You may not seek to convert Muslims to other faiths.

When travelling in Afghanistan, take care not to offend local culture or religious beliefs. Be conscious of your dress and behaviour if you intend to visit places of worship. All women, including foreign nationals, must fully cover themselves in public. Men must dress modestly and avoid wearing clothing such as sleeveless shirts or shorts.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Sharia law**

Afghanistan is governed by Sharia law, an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties under Sharia law can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. We advise you to take the utmost care to respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities. Visitors should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, arms and head.

### **Female visitors**

Female visitors can face particular issues around security in Afghanistan. It is illegal for women to travel more than 75km without being accompanied by their husband, father or brother. This could affect a womanâ€™s ability to leave Afghanistan.

All women, including foreign nationals, must fully cover themselves in public. A woman must wear:

* loose-fitting clothing to conceal her body, arms and legs
* a headscarf to cover her hair
* a veil to cover her face

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal in Afghanistan. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Forbidden products**

It is illegal to import and use narcotics, alcohol and pork products.

### **Photography**

Photography of government buildings, military installations, checkpoints and palaces is not allowed. You should avoid photographing local people without their agreement.
