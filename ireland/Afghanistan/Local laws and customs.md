## Local laws and customs

#### **We advise against all travel to Afghanistan.**

### **Muslim culture**

Afghanistan is a Muslim country in which Islamic law, customs and dress are universally respected. You should respect them fully. You may not seek to convert Muslims to other faiths.

When travelling in Afghanistan, take care not to offend local culture or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals. Be conscious of your dress and behaviour if you intend to visit places of worship.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. Guide books, local hoteliers and tour guides can be good sources of information for how to behave and dress respectfully.

### **Sharia law**

Sharia law is an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties under Sharia law can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. If you are travelling in an area governed by Sharia law, we advise you to respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities. Visitors should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, arms and head.

### **Female visitors**

Female visitors can face particular issues around security and dealing with the religious and cultural beliefs of the countries they visit (especially if they are travelling alone). We advise you do some research before you travel, so you know what to expect.

Some quick tips include:

* Always take basic personal safety precautions, such as not walking alone at night or in quiet areas.
* Do not leave your food or drink unattended.
* Keep details of your travel plans and where you are staying to yourself.
* Dress modestly if you are in a Muslim or socially conservative country.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal in Afghanistan. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Forbidden products**

It is illegal to import and use narcotics, alcohol and pork products.

### **Photography**

Photography of government buildings, military installations and palaces is not allowed.Â  You should avoid photographing local people without their agreement.
