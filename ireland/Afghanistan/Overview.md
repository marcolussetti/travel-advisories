### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Afghanistan because of the extremely volatile security situation and high risk of terrorist attacks. There is also a heightened risk of arbitrary detention of foreign nationals in Afghanistan.

We advise Irish citizens who remain in Afghanistan to register with the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi if they have not already done so. We can offer only extremely limited remote consular support to Irish citizens who choose to travel to or remain in Afghanistan, bearing in mind that no EU Member States are operational in Afghanistan at this time.

Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous, and you should, if travel is absolutely necessary, exercise extreme caution in your movements. We would advise against staying in or near hotels until further notice.

Operations at Kabul International Airport remain limited, although there are some commercial flights operating. Some people may be considering taking overland routes into neighbouring countries. We urge you to carefully consider the risks of attempting to travel overland. Some border crossings may be closed or may close without notice.
