## Travel to Afghanistan overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to Afghanistan due to the extremely volatile security situation, high risk of terrorism, and the severe limitation of human rights in the country. There is also a heightened risk of kidnapping and arbitrary detention of foreign nationals in Afghanistan. If you are detained, the Irish government may not be informed.

No EU Member States have operational Embassies in Afghanistan at this time, including Ireland. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade therefore has no ability to provide on-site consular assistance and is very limited in its ability to help any Irish citizen in Afghanistan.

We advise Irish citizens who remain in Afghanistan to register with the Irish Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan if they have not already done so and to leave the country as soon as possible. If you remain in Afghanistan despite this travel advice, be aware of the significant risk and ensure you have a carefully and professionally prepared security plan.

Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous and unpredictable, and you should, if travel is absolutely necessary, exercise extreme caution in your movements.

Operations at Kabul International Airport remain limited, although there are some commercial flights operating. Kabul Airport has been the target of terrorist attacks in the past and does not meet international safety and security standards. Overland or cross-border travel is very dangerous in Afghanistan. We urge you to carefully consider the risks of attempting to travel overland. Some border crossings may close without notice and there can be incidents of armed clashes at the border with Pakistan.
