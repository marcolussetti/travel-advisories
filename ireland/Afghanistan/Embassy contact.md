## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Afghanistan, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Pakistan.

If you need emergency assistance from the Embassy, then contact us immediately. Our telephone number is:+92 302 8563388.

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin at +353 1 408 2000 at any time.
