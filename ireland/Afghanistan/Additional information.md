## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

#### We advise against all travel to Afghanistan.

### **Visa/Passport**

If you are unsure of the entry requirements for Afghanistan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the [**Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in London**](http://afghanistanembassy.org.uk/).

Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date of entry into Afghanistan.

### **Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.

We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. Is Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Afghanistan there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

You should contact the [**nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies/) to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise you on the fees which apply.
