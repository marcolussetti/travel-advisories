## Travel to Oman overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

### Regional Tensions

Ongoing hostilities in Iran, Israel, and Palestine may escalate leading to possible attacks on military installations; and/or on strategic infrastructure. Debris from intercepted missiles or drones may cause localised damage over urban areas. The most immediate risk remains delay or cancellation of flights.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens visiting Oman for 14 days or less do not need a visa. For longer stays visas can be obtained online or, in some cases, on arrival.

A valid passport is required for travel to Oman. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Oman are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Oman does not recognise dual nationality. If you hold both Irish and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or Irish passport.

### **Risk of Piracy**

Due to the ongoing risk of piracy, we advise against all but essential travel by yacht and leisure craft on the high seas (more than 12 nautical miles from the shore) in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and part of the Indian Ocean bounded by the following latitude and longitude: 15°N in the Red Sea, 23° N in the Arabian Sea, 78° E and 15°S in the Indian Ocean.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Saudi Arabia on X [**@IrishEmbRiyadh**](https://twitter.com/irishembriyadh) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Oman by dialling 9999.
