## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Oman is a Muslim state and Islamic customs are strictly observed. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Female travellers**

In public, general modesty of behaviour and dress is expected from women. Avoid wearing shorts or tight-fitting clothes, particularly in downtown areas, as you’re likely to attract unwelcome attention. There have been some reported cases of sexual harassment.

### **Illegal drugs**

The import and use of narcotics is forbidden and can lead to imprisonment. There are severe penalties for drug offences including, in some cases, the death penalty. ‘Soft’ drugs are treated as seriously as ‘hard’ drugs. Recent experience has shown that possession of cannabis, even in quantities of less than one gram, will bring a minimum prison sentence of 12 months followed by deportation.

### **Alcohol**

Non-Muslims can import alcohol, to a maximum of two litres per family. It can be bought at a duty-free shop at the airport on arrival, but within Oman, you can only buy alcohol by personal licence or at licensed hotels and restaurants.

### **Forbidden products**

Pork products are available at specially licensed food outlets.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Oman. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.
