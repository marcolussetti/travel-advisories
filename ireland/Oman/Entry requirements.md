## Entry requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens can visit Oman without a visa if the stay is less than 14 days. This exemption is subject to certain requirements including a prior and confirmed hotel booking, health insurance, and a return ticket.

For other types of visits, Irish citizens will need a visa to enter Oman.

Visit visas are available on arrival at Muscat International Airport, however it is recommended to apply for a visa before travel. You can apply for an e-visa online before you travel through the [**Royal Oman Police portal**](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/). If you are travelling as a tourist, you can apply for an unsponsored visa.
