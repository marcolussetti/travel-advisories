## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquake**

Chile is in a high-risk zone for earthquakes. Visitors should familiarise themselves with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake or tsunami, and take note of instructions in hotel rooms. Building regulations require new structures to take account of seismic risks. Safety measures are widely known and put into practice by national organisations and local authorities. If travelling to or living in Chile, make sure to know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Volcano**

Because Chile is in an active seismic zone, volcanic eruptions can occur. If travelling to or living in Chile, make sure to know what to do in the event of an earthquake or volcanic explosion.

### **Flooding**

Flooding is frequent during autumn and winter throughout the country, mainly as a result of heavy rains and overloaded sewage systems. Transportation and services are often affected.

### **Forest fires**

Forest fires often occur during the summer months. Even though they can happen anywhere, forest fires usually occur between Santiago and Valpara√≠so and in the Magallanes. In the event of a major fire, visitors should follow the instructions of local emergency services, particularly with regard to evacuation procedures.
