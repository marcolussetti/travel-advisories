## Safety and security

### **Demonstrations and Civil Unrest**

In recent years, there have been large-scale protests and demonstrations leading to civil unrest across Chile, visitors should expect a heightened security presence. Even peaceful protests can become violent at any time. Avoid all demonstrations. Monitor local media for additional updates and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Police can use tear gas and water cannons against protesters. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations.

The largest protests usually take place in Santiago and Valparaíso and occasionally elsewhere in the country.

Nationwide protests often take place on:

* 29th March (The Day of the Young Combatant);
* 1st May (Worker’s Day);
* 11th September (anniversary of the 1973 military coup).

### **Crime and Petty Theft**

Pickpocketing, other thefts and muggings are increasingly common throughout Chile, particularly around well-known tourist sites and bus stations. There have been reports of violent muggings in areas popular with tourists in Santiago and Valparaiso. Visitors should not leave luggage unattended and should be particularly attentive at bus terminals, restaurants and other areas frequented by tourists. We advise to take great care with your belongings and avoid obvious displays of wealth. Avoid using your mobile phone in the street. Stay in groups and do not walk alone late at night.

### **Violent Theft (Mugging)**

Violent theft or muggings have increased in tourist areas of Santiago and Valparaiso. These muggings are increasingly taking place with weapons such as pistols and knives. Please be aware that muggings can take place during the day and in plain sight of others. Muggers tend to target; tourists; people carrying large amounts of moneys (leaving ATMs/money exchanges, for example); passports (please only carry a photocopy where possible); valuable watches or jewellery; mobile phones. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly in tourist areas.

### **Drink Spiking**

There have been reports of people having their drinks ‘spiked’ in nightclubs and bars, particularly in the Suecia and Bellavista areas of Santiago. These incidents leave victims open to theft or assault. Keep your drinks in sight and be wary of people offering to buy drinks for you.

### **Taxi Scams**

Many foreign visitors have been scammed for large amounts of money by unlicensed taxi drivers, including in airport taxis.

You should only book taxis at the desk inside the airport after collecting your luggage and **before you enter the arrivals hall** – please refer to [this page](https://www.mtt.gob.cl/viaja-seguro-en-taxis.html) in order to learn more about how to safely order a taxi (in Spanish). You should be able to book and pay in advance at these desks inside the airport. If you cannot pay beforehand, request and approximate amount for the journey at the taxi desk.

Be wary of people impersonating authorised taxi drivers. There are criminals who dress up as authorised taxi drivers, including people inside the airport arrival hall wearing official-looking lanyards and jackets.

At the airport in Santiago, unofficial taxi drivers may lead you to the parking lot to board a private vehicle. Official taxis should only be taken in the controlled platform located on the ground floor of both T1 and T2.

You should also insist on seeing the amount you are charged before you present your card for payment at the end of the ride.

Carefully review the amount being charged on portable credit card machines before paying, including the number of zeroes shown on the screen.

If the taxi takes you to an ATM to withdraw cash for payment, do not let the driver near the ATM while you use it.

* [buses](https://www.nuevopudahuel.cl/fromairport?language=en&target=buses)
* [transfers](https://www.nuevopudahuel.cl/fromairport?language=en&target=transfer)
* [car rental](https://www.nuevopudahuel.cl/fromairport?language=en&target=arriendo-vehiculos) (read the section ‘Vehicle crime’ below if you are planning on renting a car.

There are two companies operating in both terminals at the airport. Taxi Oficial Basico operates with black and yellow vehicles, and Taxi Oficial operates with blue vehicles.

We advise that you book taxis in advance rather than hailing one from the street, especially late at night.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Chile, be prepared and take some basic precautions:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and your international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

#### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

There have been a number of incidents in major cities where those driving rental cars have been a victim of crime. Thieves have punctured tires in order to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the vehicle. Keep windows closed and doors locked at all times. Do not leave bags, luggage or other valuable items in the car, and never in plain view. Cars that are parked on the street and left unattended are often broken into, even in affluent areas.

If you are robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance. If you are carjacked, local authorities note that it is best to raise your hands and get out of the vehicle to avoid violence.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen, it can take up to three weeks to get a replacement, due to time and distance factors, so please take extreme care with your passport and other personal documentation. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if you are able to provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Landmines**

Chile has a small but significant landmine problem. Landmine accidents mainly affect livestock and small numbers of local people crossing the borders at unauthorised crossing points. Minefields are located primarily in border areas adjacent to Peru and Bolivia in the extreme north of Chile Regions I and II, and Argentina in the south in Region XII.

Although most minefields are clearly marked, some signs and fences have been damaged by weather or vandalism and may be hard to recognise, particularly in the north of the country. Minefields are, in some cases, laid right up to the edge of highways.

Visitors should also be aware that there are mined areas in six government-protected wilderness areas in Regions I, II and XII. Although neither park rangers nor visitors have ever been injured or killed by landmines, we advise checking with local authorities before travelling to border areas of Regions I, II and XII, stick to clearly marked roads and observe all warnings signs.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Chile, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Santiago if assistance is required.
