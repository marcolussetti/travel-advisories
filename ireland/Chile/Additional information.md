Chile has strict requirements for the entry and exit of minors (under the age of 18). All minors departing Chile must provide airport officials with a notarised authorisation from non-travelling parents and an original apostilled birth certificate. For non-travelling parents based in Chile, this notarisation can be done by a Chilean notary public.

**NOTE**: Any children who were born in Chile will require a Chilean passport to exit Chile.
