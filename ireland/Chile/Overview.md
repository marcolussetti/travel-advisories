### **General Travel Advice**

In recent years, there have been large-scale protests and demonstrations leading to civil unrest across Chile, and there is a risk of violent protest in Santiago and other Chilean cities, particularly on Friday afternoons and evenings. Even peaceful protests can become violent.

The Department recommends that visitors remain vigilant and avoid all demonstrations and protests and follow the instructions of local authorities. Under Chilean law, foreign nationals visiting or living in Chile could be deported for involvement in protests and demonstrations. Monitor local media for additional updates.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Chile for stays up to 90 days.
