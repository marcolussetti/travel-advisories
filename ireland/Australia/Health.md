## Health

Always get comprehensive travel insurance. The Reciprocal Health Agreement between Ireland and Australia will cover citizens and residents of Ireland for emergency care only. For more information, please see [**here**](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements-visiting-from-republic-ireland?context=22481).

### **COVID-19**

You do not need a pre-departure COVID-19 test to enter or transit Australia regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status. Please see the [**Australian government’s website**](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/travel#state-and-territory-travel-restrictions) for advice on COVID-19 and travelling, and be aware that COVID-19 restrictions can change with very little notice.

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Visitors to northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north of Western Australia may be exposed to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Ross River fever. Take suitable precautions and use insect repellents and sleeping nets.

There have been reports of cases of Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE), a potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease, in the Northern Territory and north Western Australia, with occasional cases in Queensland, New South Wales, central Australia and the central regions of Western Australia.

### **Medical Treatment**

Emergency hospital treatment for Irish people legally resident in Australia is covered by the Reciprocal Health Agreement between the two countries. This doesn’t cover the cost of ambulances and follow-up care. Temporary residents are not generally entitled to Medicare (Australian public health rebate system) and as such may have to pay in full for childhood vaccinations and other medical bills. Temporary residents are not generally entitled to social welfare (Centrelink) payments. The system is structured differently in Australia so you may not be entitled to any child benefit payments and even if you were entitled to a medical card at home you will be required to pay for medical appointments and related services in Australia.
