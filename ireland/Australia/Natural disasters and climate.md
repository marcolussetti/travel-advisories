## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

The Australian climate can be extreme. Drought in one area can be paralleled by severe flooding in another. The north of the country gets a wet and a dry season, and much of the centre of the country is desert or semi-arid. While the climate is generally temperate in the south-east and south-west corners, even here the summer heat can be intense.

The weather between different cities may vary widely at certain times of the year. If you are planning on travelling around Australia, it is important to stay aware of the weather in each place you intend to stay. Up to date weather forecasts for all areas are available at [**the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology.**](http://www.bom.gov.au/)

There is a wider risk of tropical cyclones which occur mainly in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia between November and April. -You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow the advice of local authorities, including the state emergency services and [**Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology**](http://www.bom.gov.au/).

### **Sun safety**

The sunburn index is very high in Australia during both summer and winter months and the country has a high rate of skin cancer. High factor sun protection should be reapplied frequently and we highly recommend wearing a hat. For more information about sun safety, read the [**Australian Cancer Council’s “SunSmart” tips**](https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/causes-and-prevention/sun-safety/be-sunsmart).

### **Bush fires**

Due to the dry conditions in many parts of Australia, it is important to be alert to the possibility of bush fires. Each state has specific information and services available to help you plan ahead, stay informed, and stay alert to the possibility of bushfires. These services are listed by state [**here**](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/preparing-for-natural-disasters?context=60042).

If there is a fire in your area, stay tuned to local radio for updates or download the ‘Fires Near Me Australia’ app. Know what to look out for and observe total fire ban warnings where they are in place. Find out what bushfire safety plans are in place in the area where you are camping, caravanning or renting accommodation. Bush fires have devastating effects and there are heavy penalties applied for breach of the rules.

During times of minimal rainfall, usually from October to April, intense bushfires can occur. Follow the advice of local authorities, and avoid affected or susceptible areas.

Consult the website of [**the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology**](http://www.bom.gov.au/) for information on weather conditions.

### **Flooding**

Depending on the season, flash flooding can occur in many areas. Floods in recent years have led to loss of life and cut off whole towns and communities so pay attention to local warnings. It’s dangerous to try to cross swollen creeks or other flood waters; their power and depth may be deceptive.

Some unsealed roads (common in rural areas) may not be passable after heavy rain even if you’re travelling in a 4 x 4 vehicle. It’s important not to rely solely on GPS when planning a route. Local advice is usually available and should be sought out and heeded.
