## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

You will need a visa in advance to enter Australia. You have to be pre-cleared and issued with an Electronic Travel Authorisation. Travel agents, the nearest Australian Embassy or [**the Australian Immigration**](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/) website can provide further details.

Always respect the terms of your visa. It’s an offence to overstay a visa and doing so will likely incur a sanction, which can include up to a three-year ban on entering the country.

Immigration law is very strictly enforced –do not be under any illusion on this point.
