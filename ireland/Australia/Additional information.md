## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

You will need a visa in advance to enter Australia. You have to be pre-cleared and issued with an Electronic Travel Authorisation. Travel agents, the nearest Australian Embassy or [**the Australian Immigration**](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/) website can provide further details.

Always respect the terms of your visa. It’s an offence to overstay a visa and doing so will likely incur a sanction, which can include up to a three-year ban on entering the country.

Immigration law is very strictly enforced –do not be under any illusion on this point.

For up to date information on [**visas**](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing) to enter Australia, please check on [**the Department of Home Affairs website.**](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/)

### **Health**

Always get comprehensive travel insurance. The Reciprocal Health Agreement between Ireland and Australia will cover citizens and residents of Ireland for emergency care only. For more information, please see [**here**](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements-visiting-from-republic-ireland?context=22481).

### **COVID-19**

You do not need a pre-departure COVID-19 test to enter or transit Australia regardless of your COVID-19 vaccination status. Please see the [**Australian government’s website**](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/travel#state-and-territory-travel-restrictions) for advice on COVID-19 and travelling, and be aware that COVID-19 restrictions can change with very little notice.

### **Mosquito-borne diseases**

Visitors to northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north of Western Australia may be exposed to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Ross River fever. Take suitable precautions and use insect repellents and sleeping nets.

There have been reports of cases of Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE), a potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease, in the Northern Territory and north Western Australia, with occasional cases in Queensland, New South Wales, central Australia and the central regions of Western Australia.

### **Moving to Australia for an extended period**

If you’re thinking about moving to Australia for an extended period as a family unit, the most important thing is to [**fully research the visa class you intend to travel on.**](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/) Get a clear and accurate picture of what entitlements will or will not apply for you and your family.

Take the time to research the state and city where you plan to relocate. Find out about issues such as childcare and school fees before you arrive.

### **Cost of living**

The cost of living in Australia is high. Good accommodation in the major cities can be difficult to find and is very expensive by Irish standards. This applies in particular to Sydney and Melbourne, where there is a significant shortage of suitable accommodation, with rental prices reflecting the high demand.

### **Schools/child care**

There may be long waiting lists for schools and child care in certain areas and you may have to apply for places before you leave Ireland. Take note that the Australian school year begins in end January/February not in September as is the case at home.

In some states, notably New South Wales and Western Australia, temporary residents may have to pay significant fees for public primary schools and they may not be entitled to benefit from Australian tax rebates for child care expenses.

### **Medical treatment**

Emergency hospital treatment for Irish people legally resident in Australia is covered by the Reciprocal Health Agreement between the two countries. This doesn’t cover the cost of ambulances and follow-up care. Temporary residents are not generally entitled to Medicare (Australian public health rebate system) and as such may have to pay in full for childhood vaccinations and other medical bills. Temporary residents are not generally entitled to social welfare (Centrelink) payments. The system is structured differently in Australia so you may not be entitled to any child benefit payments and even if you were entitled to a medical card at home you will be required to pay for medical appointments and related services in Australia.
