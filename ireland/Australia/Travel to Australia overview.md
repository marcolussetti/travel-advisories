Visitors to Australia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact all emergency services in Australia by dialling 000.

Within Australia, the protection of life and property is a responsibility of State and Territory governments. This responsibility includes the provision of Emergency Services Organisations (ESOs) i.e. police, fire and ambulance service. A number of ESOs provide their own information on what to do in an emergency.

Please use the links below to view the ESO websites in your particular state or territory. This information may help to save your life or property.
