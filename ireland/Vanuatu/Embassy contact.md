## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Vanuatu, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in New Zealand.

If you require emergency assistance from the Embassy, please contact us on +64 4 4712252. If you call outside normal working hours, you will be given instructions to call another number to speak to a Duty Officer.

You may also wish to call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin directly at 00353-1-4082000.
