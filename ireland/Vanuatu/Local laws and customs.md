## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Same-sex relations are not criminalised, but are not widely socially accepted. Modesty and discretion in both dress and behaviour is advised to avoid offending local sensitivities.
