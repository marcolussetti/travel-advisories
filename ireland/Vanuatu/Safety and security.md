## Safety and security

### **Crime**

The crime rate in Vanuatu is low but crime does occur. Risks increase after dark, in isolated locations and if you're alone.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Vanuatu:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Pay close attention to security, ensure that all doors and windows are locked at night and while absent and that valuables are kept in a safe and secure place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Road Travel**

Road travel in Vanuatu can be dangerous. Roads are often poorly maintained and unlit.

Pedestrians often walk on roads and can be hard to see at night.
