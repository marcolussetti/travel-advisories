## Safety and security

### **Crime**

The crime rate in Vanuatu is low but crime does occur. Risks increase after dark, in isolated locations and if you're alone.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Vanuatu:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Pay close attention to security, ensure that all doors and windows are locked at night and while absent and that valuables are kept in a safe and secure place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Same-sex relations are not criminalised, but are not widely socially accepted. Modesty and discretion in both dress and behaviour is advised to avoid offending local sensitivities.

### **Road travel**

Road travel in Vanuatu can be dangerous. Roads are often poorly maintained and unlit.

Pedestrians often walk on roads and can be hard to see at night.

### **Nature and Climate**

### **Earthquakes and volcanoes**

Vanuatu is located in a seismically active zone, which can lead to earthquakes and volcanic activity, with an associated risk of tsunamis. Reports on volcanic activity throughout Vanuatu (and any current cyclone or tsunami warnings), is available from the [**Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department website**.](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php) Travellers can also check with the [**Vanuatu Tourism Office**](http://vanuatutravel.info/index.php)or the Tafea Provincial Council Office for Mount Yasur in Tanna.

### **Tropical storms and Cyclones**

The cyclone season is from November to April. Tropical storms and cyclones can also occur in other months. They can disrupt essential services and cause property damage, injuries, and loss of life.

Vanuatu continues to recover from the impacts of Cyclones Judy and Kevin, which caused widespread damage. There still may be disruptions to infrastructure, services and telecommunications in some locations.

The [**Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office**](https://ndmo.gov.vu/) has a [**colour-coded cyclone alert system**](https://ndmo.gov.vu/fr/community/cyclone-awareness/109-colour-alerts)that includes safety procedures to follow during a cyclone.
