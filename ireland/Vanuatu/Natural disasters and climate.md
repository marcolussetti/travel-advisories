## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes and Volcanoes**

Vanuatu is located in a seismically active zone, which can lead to earthquakes and volcanic activity, with an associated risk of tsunamis. Reports on volcanic activity throughout Vanuatu (and any current cyclone or tsunami warnings), is available from the [**Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department website.**](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php) Travellers can also check with the [**Vanuatu Tourism Office**](http://vanuatutravel.info/index.php) or the Tafea Provincial Council Office for Mount Yasur in Tanna.

There was a large earthquake in Port Vila on 17 December 2024 which caused damage to buildings and infrastructure. Some areas remain closed while assessments of damaged buildings are underway. Follow the advice of local authorities and do not enter closed areas. Some areas remain inaccessible following landslides.

### **Tropical Storms and Cyclones**

The cyclone season is from November to April. Tropical storms and cyclones can also occur in other months. They can disrupt essential services and cause property damage, injuries, and loss of life.

Vanuatu continues to recover from the impacts of Cyclones Judy and Kevin, which caused widespread damage. There still may be disruptions to infrastructure, services and telecommunications in some locations.

The [**Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office**](https://ndmo.gov.vu/) has a [**colour-coded cyclone alert system**](https://ndmo.gov.vu/fr/community/cyclone-awareness/109-colour-alerts) that includes safety procedures to follow during a cyclone.
