## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens require permission to enter Turkmenistan. If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Turkmenistan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the [**Embassy of Turkmenistan in London**](https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en).

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

Visitors crossing Turkmenistan by car who will be present in the country for under five days may be able to use a transit visa. There is no visa on arrival and there are strict criteria for the use of a transit visa including committing to arriving and leaving by pre-agreed border crossings.

You can apply for a transit visa from the Embassy of Turkmenistan in London, a process that can take up to a month. For more information contact the [**Embassy of Turkmenistan in London**](https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en).

### **Stays of more than three days**

Visitors staying in Turkmenistan for more than three working days must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within three days of arrival. This will normally be arranged by your hotel or sponsor, but you are advised to confirm with them before travel, including what documents will be required. Typically, registration requires your passport, two passport sized photographs and written confirmation of where you are staying from your sponsor.

### **Passport**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Turkmenistan and you should carry a photocopy of your passport and visa at all times during your stay because local police often request proof of identity.

### **Dual Nationality**

Turkmenistan does not recognise dual nationality and you are expected to have only one passport with you. You are not allowed to enter Turkmenistan without the prior approval of the Turkmen authorities.
