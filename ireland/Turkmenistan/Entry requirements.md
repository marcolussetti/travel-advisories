## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens require permission to enter Turkmenistan. If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Turkmenistan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the [**Embassy of Turkmenistan in London**](https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en).

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Passport**

Itâ€™s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Turkmenistan and you should carry a photocopy of your passport and visa at all times during your stay because local police often request proof of identity.

### **Dual Nationality**

Turkmenistan does not recognise dual nationality and you are expected to have only one passport with you. You are not allowed to enter Turkmenistan without the prior approval of the Turkmen authorities.
