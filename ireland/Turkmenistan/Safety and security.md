## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Certain parts of Turkmenistan have been designated as ‘restricted’ and special permits are required from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to travel there. Check the situation with your local guide before travelling outside the capital.

We advise you to avoid the Turkmenistan/Afghanistan border area.

Avoid any demonstrations and public gatherings. Always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Turkmenistan is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates. You should be particularly vigilant in public places and pay attention to any security announcements by the Turkmen authorities.

### **Crime**

Crime in Turkmenistan is comparatively low, but you should always take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Keep valuables out of sight and avoid obvious displays of wealth, especially in rural areas
* Keep away from unlit or remote areas

### **Women Travellers**

Women should take basic personal safety precautions such as avoiding going out alone late at night.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Turkmenistan, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Türkiye**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/turkiye/ankara/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Turkmenistan, you should take care. Many roads are poor and badly lit. Driving at night is not advisable.  If you want to drive, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and your international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Don’t travel in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car. We advise you to hire a private car and driver or an officially licensed taxi through your hotel or travel agency.

### **Air Safety**

We can’t be sure that maintenance procedures on aircraft used for internal flights are properly observed so if possible don’t fly on [**airlines listed under the EU operating ban**](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban_en). Where possible, use a direct flight originating from outside Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
