## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Turkmenistan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the [**Embassy of Turkmenistan in London**](https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en).

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Turkmenistan and you should carry a photocopy of your passport and visa at all times during your stay because local police often request proof of identity.

### **Dual nationality**

Turkmenistan does not recognise dual nationality and you are expected to have only one passport with you. You are not allowed to enter Turkmenistan without the prior approval of the Turkmen authorities.

### **Medical facilities**

The quality of medical care in Turkmenistan is poor and anything other than basic or emergency treatment, particularly outside the capital, is best avoided.

### **Illnesses**

Typhoid and hepatitis A have occurred in Turkmenistan. The World Health Organisation declared the country malaria-free in 2010.

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled or bottled water during your stay.

### **Mobile phones**

There is no roaming service within Turkmenistan which means that foreign mobile phones do not work there.

### **Money**

You should bring enough money for the duration of your stay and only change money through official exchange booths.
