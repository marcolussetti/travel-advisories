## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

The possession and use of drugs is illegal.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal under Turkmen law and is still very much frowned upon socially.

The issue of relationships between foreign men and local women is also sensitive. We advise caution and discretion at all times and you should avoid public displays of affection.

### **Photography**

Photographing many of the official buildings is prohibited (including the Presidential Palace) and it is best to check with a local police officer first.

### **Mobile Phones**

There is no roaming service within Turkmenistan which means that foreign mobile phones do not work there.

### **Money**

You should bring enough money for the duration of your stay and only change money through official exchange booths. US Dollars in particular are recommended.

### **Alcohol Consumption**

Consumption of alcohol in public spaces, outside of licensed bars and restaurants is illegal.

### **Smoking and use of e-cigarettes**

It is illegal to smoke outside or in any communal area unless they contain a designated smoking area. This includes otherwise public spaces such as squares or pavements.

### **Relationships with Turkmens**

It is illegal for a Turkmen woman to have sexual relationship with a foreign national. Foreign nationals who provide gifts, transport or other benefits to Turkmen women in the expectation of even a short relationship can be immediately fined and deported.
