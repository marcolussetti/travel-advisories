## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Turkmenistan, consular assistance is provided via the [**Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Türkiye**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/turkiye/ankara/).

Please note if assistance is required in the case of an emergency while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy of Ireland Türkiye number, +90 312 4591000, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox. This mailbox will be monitored regularly. Please have an English speaker leave the initial message.

Monday to Friday 09:00-13:00 and 14:00-17:00 (UTC + 3)
