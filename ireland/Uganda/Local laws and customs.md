## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local Culture**

Uganda is a friendly, if socially conservative country. Overt displays of affection, in general, are not encouraged.

### **Bribery and Corruption**

Certain Irish laws, such as those relating to the [**bribery of foreign public officials**](/716/convention-combating-bribery-foreign-public-officals.pdf), apply to Irish nationals overseas: if you commit these offences while abroad you may be prosecuted in Ireland.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexual activity is illegal and there is very little social tolerance of homosexuality in Uganda. In May 2023, Uganda approved an “Anti-Homosexuality law” which imposes severe penalties for a range of offenses, including so-called ‘promotion’ of homosexuality. Travelers from the LGBTQ+ community are advised to act with caution and discretion at all times.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Smoking Ban**

The 2015 Tobacco Control Act bans the use of cigarettes, water pipes etc. in public areas such as restaurants, bars and hotels. Local law enforcement implements the ban diligently and the law should be abided by all.
