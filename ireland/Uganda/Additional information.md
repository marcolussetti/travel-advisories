## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens are visa exempt for Uganda and receive a stamp on arrival. There is no fee for this service. However, this is subject to change and we advise citizens to check back here and on the website of Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration regularly. It may be useful to print off [**this page from Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration**](https://immigration.go.ug/index.php/services/visa-exempt-countries) should any issue be encountered at your point of embarkation or transit.

Immigration officials may give permission to stay for three months if they believe visitors are entering solely for tourism purposes; however, be aware that recent practice has been to give one month permissions. It is important to make sure that your passport is stamped on arrival as there have been recent cases where this was not done.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Uganda; visitors may be refused entry at the border or when trying to board a flight to Uganda if less than 6 months validity.  Irish Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Uganda.

Yellow fever vaccination is required for travellers arriving from all countries. Irish citizens will be asked to show proof of Yellow Fever vaccination upon arrival and departure. Passengers without Yellow Fever certificates/cards shall be vaccinated at their own cost.

If travellers are unsure of the entry requirements for Uganda, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Uganda.

### **Health**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that travellers obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel – you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Quality medical care services are limited, especially outside Kampala and other major urban centres. Medical help at the scene of an accident is also likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Adequate insurance can be crucial in helping people get the medical attention required. Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes. You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria can be contracted throughout the year and anywhere in Uganda, including in Kampala. It is highly advisable to take precautions:

* Avoid mosquito bites by covering up with clothing such as long sleeves and long trousers, especially after sunset, using insect repellents on exposed skin and sleeping under a mosquito net.
* Check with your doctor or nurse about suitable antimalarial tablets.
* If you develop a fever, you are advised to seek medical attention promptly
* If travelling to high risk malarious areas, remote from medical facilities, carrying emergency malaria standby treatment should be seriously considered.

### **Ebola**

Uganda experiences periodic outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever. Travellers should follow local health advice during an outbreak.

### **Water**

Drink or use only boiled or bottled water.

### **Adventure sports**

If participating in extreme adventure sports (white water rafting, kayaking, bungee jumping etc.), you should check whether these activities are provided for in your insurance, and arrangements for accessing medical facilities in case of emergency.  Travellers should be aware that many of these adventure sports operators are unregulated and so care should be taken in selecting reputable tour companies.
