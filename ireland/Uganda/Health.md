### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that travellers obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel â€“ you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

### **Medical Services**

Quality medical care services are limited, especially outside Kampala and other major urban centres. Medical help at the scene of an accident is also likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Adequate insurance can be crucial in helping people get the medical attention required.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes. You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria can be contracted throughout the year and anywhere in Uganda, including in Kampala. It is highly advisable to take precautions:

* Avoid mosquito bites by covering up with clothing such as long sleeves and long trousers, especially after sunset, using insect repellents on exposed skin and sleeping under a mosquito net.
* Check with your doctor or nurse about suitable antimalarial tablets.
* If you develop a fever, you are advised to seek medical attention promptly
* If travelling to high risk malarious areas, remote from medical facilities, carrying emergency malaria standby treatment should be seriously considered.

### **Ebola**

Uganda experiences periodic outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever. Travellers should follow local health advice during an outbreak.

### **Water**

Drink or use only boiled or bottled water.

### **Adventure Sports**

If participating in extreme adventure sports (white water rafting, kayaking, bungee jumping etc.), you should check whether these activities are provided for in your insurance, and arrangements for accessing medical facilities in case of emergency. Travellers should be aware that many of these adventure sports operators are unregulated and so care should be taken in selecting reputable tour companies.
