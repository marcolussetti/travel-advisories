## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens are visa exempt for Uganda and receive a stamp on arrival. There is no fee for this service. However, this is subject to change and we advise citizens to check back here and on the website of Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration regularly. It may be useful to print off [**this page from Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration**](https://immigration.go.ug/index.php/services/visa-exempt-countries) should any issue be encountered at your point of embarkation or transit.

Immigration officials may give permission to stay for three months if they believe visitors are entering solely for tourism purposes; however, be aware that recent practice has been to give one month permissions. It is important to make sure that your passport is stamped on arrival as there have been recent cases where this was not done.

### Passport

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Uganda; visitors may be refused entry at the border or when trying to board a flight to Uganda if less than 6 months validity.  Irish Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Uganda.

### Yellow Fever

Yellow fever vaccination is required for travellers arriving from all countries. Irish citizens will be asked to show proof of Yellow Fever vaccination upon arrival and departure. Passengers without Yellow Fever certificates/cards shall be vaccinated at their own cost.

If travellers are unsure of the entry requirements for Uganda, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Uganda.
