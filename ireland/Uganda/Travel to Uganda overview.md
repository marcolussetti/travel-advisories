Uganda has experienced disturbances during previous election periods. Citizens are advised that political demonstrations in Uganda can take a violent turn without warning. Irish citizens in Uganda should avoid all political gatherings including demonstrations, public gatherings and rallies; remain vigilant at all times; and follow local media for updates. Travel around the Uganda may also be affected during the campaigning and election period. Citizens are advised to plan routes accordingly.

### **Terrorism in Uganda**

There is currently a high risk of terrorism in Uganda and across the East Africa Region. Terror attacks can be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. Large crowds of people and public places may also be targets.

We advise Irish citizens to exercise a high level of caution in public areas, including shopping malls, schools and tourist sites. Citizens should avoid large gatherings.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against all but essential travel to Queen Elizabeth National Park at this time. The Embassy also advises against all but essential travel to Semuliki National Park, and to the area immediately south-west of Kasese up to the DRC border.

Recent significant attacks include:

* On 3 June 2025, a device carried by motorbike exploded in Munyonyo – Kampala – close to a large gathering of pilgrims.
* On 17 October 2023 two foreign tourists and their local guide were killed by suspected terrorists in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Security operations in response to this incident are ongoing.

In September 2023 a number of improvised explosive devices were captured by police. Two devices exploded in the greater Kampala area in December 2023.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens are visa exempt for Uganda and receive a stamp on arrival. There is no fee for this service. However, this is subject to change and we advise citizens to monitor the advice here and on the website of Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration. It may be useful to print off  [**this page from Uganda's Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration**](https://immigration.go.ug/index.php/services/visa-exempt-countries) should any issue be encountered at your point of embarkation or transit.

A valid passport is required for travel to Uganda Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Uganda are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains volatile, and travellers should be particularly alert in western Uganda. Citizens are advised to remain alert to the possibility of military or terrorist incursions, stray bullets, and/or artillery fire entering Uganda when near the DRC border.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Uganda by dialling 999. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 112
* Fire brigade: 0800199299
