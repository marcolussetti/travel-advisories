## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquake**

Bangladesh is in a high-risk earthquake zone. If you’re travelling to or living in Bangladesh, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Flooding**

There’s widespread flooding during the monsoon season between June and September, which disrupts travel, especially in rural areas. You should check that routes are passable before setting out on long journeys.
