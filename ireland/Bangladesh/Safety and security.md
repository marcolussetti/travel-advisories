## Safety and security

### **Political unrest**

You should avoid demonstrations and be cautious when travelling in Bangladesh. There is a strong and visible security presence on the streets of Dhaka.

If you’re travelling to Bangladesh, always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your local contact, hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn violent.

### **Terrorism**

There's a continuing threat from terrorism in Bangladesh and indiscriminate terrorist attacks could be made against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

Attacks include the terrorist attack in Gulshan, the diplomatic area of Dhaka in July 2016 that resulted in the death of 20 hostages and 2 police officers and which primarily targeted the expatriate community.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Bangladesh but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Travel between towns after dark, by train, bus or ferry, is particularly risky because of banditry.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Bangladesh, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in New Delhi**](/en/india/newdelhi/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you're planning to drive in Bangladesh, you should be extremely careful. Road safety is very poor and traffic is heavy and chaotic in urban areas.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Be aware that drivers of larger vehicles expect to be given right of way
* Pedestrians and rickshaws cross the road without looking
* Many vehicles are unlit at night, or travel on full-beam headlights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
