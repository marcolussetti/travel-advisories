## Health

### Vaccinations

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Bangladesh. If you have a pre-existing health condition, check with your doctor before travelling.

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical facilities are extremely poor and routine tests and X-rays are unreliable. You must have suitable medical insurance and be prepared to travel outside Bangladesh for treatment.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is usually restricted to specific rural areas, especially the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Some over-the-counter prophylactics offer no protection. Avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using mosquito repellents.

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever is common in towns, including Dhaka. Over-the-counter prophylactics offer no protection. Avoiding mosquito bites by covering up and using mosquito repellents is the only way to protect against Dengue fever.
