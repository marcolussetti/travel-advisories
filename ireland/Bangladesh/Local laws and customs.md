## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. Some drugs-related offences are punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment.

### **Muslim Culture**

Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in Bangladesh’s customs, laws and regulations. Use common sense and discretion in your behaviour. All visitors should dress modestly to avoid giving offence and women should cover their shoulders and wear long skirts or trousers.

You should respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. During Ramadan, you should refrain from drinking, eating and smoking in public between sunrise and sunset.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal in Bangladesh. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.
