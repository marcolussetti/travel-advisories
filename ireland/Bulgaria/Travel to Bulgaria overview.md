#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Sofia for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

### **General Travel Advice**

Bulgaria is generally a safe country with a low level of crime. In major urban centres, like Sofia, English is more widely spoken, but not universally so. Outside of urban centres, English is far less common and may not be spoken at all. Please bear this is in mind when planning any journeys.

Please note that Bulgaria has been accepted into the Schengen area, as of 1 January 2025.

Bulgaria will become a member of the Eurozone on 1 January 2026, with a fixed conversion rate of €1 = 1.95583 BGN. There will be dual currency circulation phase of one month, after which time cash payments will only be accepted in Euro.

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Bulgaria.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of the stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Bulgaria. However, if staying for longer than three months, travellers must register their presence with the Ministry of Interior.

Visitors to Bulgaria are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbSofia**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbSofia) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyofIrelandSofia/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.
