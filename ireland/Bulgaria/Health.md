### **Travel Insurance**

Comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong during the holiday. Even relatively minor incidents or illnesses can result in bills of several hundred euro at private health centres in Bulgaria. For more serious matters, bills can quickly run into thousands of euro. A medical evacuation or repatriation of remains to Ireland can cost thousands more.

If buying an appropriate travel insurance policy before departure, these costs will be covered provided the terms and conditions have not been broken. Most insurance policies will not cover drink- or drug-related incidents. Insurance also cannot be taken out after an incident or treatment has occurred, and in most cases must be bought before travel.  
Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure the policy covers all planned activities for you trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that travellers purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

The Embassy cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad.

### **Emergency Expenses**

As well as all medical care abroad, the travel insurance policy should cover:

* the entire trip, from departure to return - consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year;
* emergency treatment including evacuation by air ambulance, any costs associated with an unexpected longer stay due to medical issues, and repatriation of remains;
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance;
* any extra activities travellers intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet-skiing or other extreme sports);
* personal liability cover (in case travellers are sued for causing injury or damaging property);
* lost and stolen possessions;
* cancellation and curtailment.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

We advise getting a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before travelling to Bulgaria. This card replaces the E111 form and entitles travellers to emergency medical treatment in public healthcare facilities on the same terms as Bulgarian nationals. The EHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance and does not cover most treatment in private clinics (where the majority of tourists have treatment), medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Always check with the hospital/clinic administrator beforehand whether the EHIC will be accepted. Applications for an EHIC can be submitted on the [**HSE’s website**](https://www2.hse.ie/services/ehic/ehic.html).

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical staff in Bulgaria are generally well-trained but hospitals and clinics are sometimes poorly resourced. If staying in resorts, be careful to check if the medical facility is public or private and ensure that travellers are covered by insurance or the EHIC, or can afford the treatment if choosing a private facility.

There have been recent reports that illegal ambulances are operating in the Bansko ski resort, charging tourists hefty fees for transfers to the local hospital. If travellers come across any incidents such as these, report them to the local police by calling the standard emergency number, 112.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Bulgaria.
