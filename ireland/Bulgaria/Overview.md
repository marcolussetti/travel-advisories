### **General Travel Advice**

Bulgaria is generally a safe country with a low level of crime. In major urban centres, like Sofia, English is more widely spoken, but not universally so. Outside of urban centres, English is far less common and may not be spoken at all. Please bear this is in mind when planning any journeys.

Please note that Bulgaria has been accepted into the Schengen area, as of 1 January 2025.

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Bulgaria.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of the stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Bulgaria. However, if staying for longer than three months, travellers must register their presence with the Ministry of Interior.

Visitors to Bulgaria are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
