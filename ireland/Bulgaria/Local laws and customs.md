## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to travellers and it is their responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as traveller’s behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **LGBTQ+**

Attitudes towards LGBTQ+ can be conservative compared to Western Europe.

### **Language**

The Bulgarian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet and outside major cities information signs may not to be translated into English.

### **Buying property**

Bulgaria became a popular location for property investment in recent years. If considering investing in property in Bulgaria, we strongly recommend getting an independent, English-speaking property lawyer to give advice before making a purchase.

Getting legal redress in Bulgaria can take some time if things go wrong. The Department of Foreign Affairs cannot get involved in legal proceedings between two private parties, nor can we take get involved in steps to recover any investments in individual property deals.

Many foreign-owned properties in Bulgaria are left unoccupied for periods of time. The Bulgarian police recommend that owners put security arrangements in place during this time.

### **Getting married**

To get married in Bulgaria at least one of the couple must be either a Bulgarian citizen or have residency in Bulgaria. If these criteria are met , travellers will also need a Certificat de Coutume, otherwise known as a Certificate of Freedom to Marry.

Irish citizens, can apply for this either through the Embassy of Ireland covering their country of residence (i.e. the Embassy in Sofia if you live in Bulgaria) if living abroad, or through the Consular Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin if travellers live in Ireland. A certificate obtained in Dublin will have to also be apostilled by the Department of Foreign Affairs in order to meet Bulgarian requirements. Find out more information about [**authentication of documents here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/consular-services/authenticating-apostilles/). In both cases the certificate must be presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sofia to be stamped.
