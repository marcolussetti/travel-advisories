## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter Bulgaria. However, children need an individual passport to enter the country. If staying longer than 90 days travellers should register with the local police and get a temporary residentâ€™s card.

### **Currency**

The Bulgarian Lev is the currency used, and cash is still the most widely accepted form of payment. Credit cards are becoming more widespread but can not be relied on to work everywhere and are not accepted in some outlets. ATMs are also widely available, and Irish cards are accepted by most of those affiliated with the larger banks.

Euro can be changed into Lev in most banks and in street exchange bureaus for normal rates. However, take care to examine the rates offered and only use licensed bureaus. We recommend using currency exchange bureaus in banks if at all possible. Check the exchange rate on receipt before signing for the transaction as exchange rates may differ from those displayed, depending on the amount of commission being charged.

Be cautious if approached on the street by anyone offering to exchange money for travellers as these people tend to be con artists, intent on scamming tourists. Take care when using ATMs as in Ireland as instances of card skimming have been known to happen.

The Bulgarian police request that anyone who experiences problems with exchange bureaus, ATM fraud or credit card fraud report it to the nearest police station as soon as possible. Delays in reporting can hamper investigations.

### **Public transport**

Public transport throughout Bulgaria is generally good, although the standard of buses and trams in the cities is varied. Tickets can be purchased in bulk from ticket kiosks or for single journeys on the tram or bus. Sofia has a metro system with four lines that run through the city centre.

Travelling by bus or air within the country is cheap and reliable. There are internal flights between Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas and Varna which are quite accessible. The bus network is quite extensive.

Train travel is less popular and the quality of the service is not as comfortable. Car hire is also possible, with international companies such as Avis and Hertz operating in Bulgaria as well as other local companies.
