## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Bulgaria is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Protests**

We strongly advise avoiding protests and taking photographs. Keep up-to-date with local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **Crime**

Bulgaria generally has a low level of crime. However, pickpocketing and petty crime is common in tourist areas, particularly around the Black Sea coastal resorts, and transport hubs, such as airports and bus terminals.

Take care with personal belongings, especially on public transport, and around tourist attractions, markets and shopping malls. Do not walk around with a passport or wallet in the back pocket of your jeans. Do not keep valuables in a bag/pouch which someone else can open without it being noticed . Keep valuables stored in a secure location, such as a hotel safe. Be alert to possible scams. If approached in a busy area, this could be an attempt to distract travellers while they are robbed.

If reporting a crime, contact the local police on 112.

### **Taxis**

Taxis in Bulgaria are generally a reliable and cost effective way to get around. However, there are some taxi drivers who overcharge, particularly at airports, train and bus stations and from outside hotels. To avoid this, use a taxi recommended by the accommodation provider or tour operator. Always check that rates per kilometre and other charges are clearly displayed on a sticker on the car window and that the taxi meter is working.

At Sofia airport use an authorised taxi, either by booking at the taxi desk in the arrivals hall or going to the official rank just outside the end of the terminal (to the right of the arrival gate in Terminal 2). Do not take a taxi with anyone who approaches you at the terminal offering a taxi service. Alternatively, it is possible to take the Metro directly from Terminal 2 to the city centre.  
If travellers suspect that they have been overcharged by a taxi driver, contact the traffic police (KAT) through the 112 emergency number. In Sunny Beach, bring the receipt and details of the driver’s registration to the Sunny Beach JSC resort management company.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Bulgaria, be extremely careful. Road conditions can be dangerous, with roads (and pavements) often poorly maintained, poorly lit and full of potholes. Avoid driving at night time, especially outside major cities.

Bulgarian driving tends to be aggressive and we recommend avoiding confrontations with aggressive drivers. There can be a large number of trucks and lorries on the major roadways towards Turkey and Greece. It is not unusual to encounter slow-moving cars and animal-drawn vehicles on the roads. Equally, high-speed driving is common and drivers should remain alert.

Winter driving in Bulgaria can be difficult so make sure adequate preparation is done. Snow chains must be carried from 1 November until 1 March and used when the relevant sign is displayed. Winter tyres are compulsory for vehicles registered in Bulgaria during wintry road conditions.

Legally, travellers must drive with running lights or dipped beam headlights throughout the year, even during the daytime. It is compulsory to carry the following equipment in your vehicle: fire extinguisher (not required for 2-wheeled vehicles), a first-aid kit and a warning triangle (not required for 2-wheeled vehicles). A reflective jacket must be used by anyone who steps on to the road in a breakdown or emergency.

If travellers want to drive:

* Bring full Irish driving license and make sure adequate and appropriate insurance is purchased.
* If bringing own car, make sure to have all original registration and ownership documents.
* To travel on the roads between cities in Bulgaria, cars must display a ‘vignette’ or road tax sticker. These can be purchased in large filling stations, post offices, DZI bank offices and at the border points and ports.
* Be aware of Bulgaria’s traffic laws, such as speed limits. These are: 50km/h in the cities and towns, 90km/h out of town, and 130 km/h on the highways. For motorcycles, speed limits are 50 km/h in the cities and towns, 80 km/h out of town, and 100 km/h on the highways.

Police checkpoints are common, particularly when leaving a town, and on-the-spot fines can be charged for minor violations. There are, however, reports of police officers attempting extortion through fines.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle in Bulgaria, we advise not to hand over the passport as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in sight at all times.

If bringing a hired car into Bulgaria, make sure to have the original contract document. The document should state that the car can be brought into Bulgaria.

Check that adequate insurance is purchased and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
