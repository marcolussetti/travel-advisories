## Entry requirements

### Visas

Irish citizens who are planning to visit Botswana for less than 90 days, do not require a visa.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Botswana and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from your intended date of departure from Botswana.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Botswana and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad you should contact the Irish Embassy in South Africa. We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.

### **Travelling with Children**

You must have an original or certified copy of the full birth certificate for any child under 18 when you enter or leave the country. Any parent not present must sign an affidavit giving their consent for the child to travel.
