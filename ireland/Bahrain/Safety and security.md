## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Bahrain but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place;
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home;
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business;
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible; and
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Bahrain, report it to the local police immediately. If you require further assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Riyadh**](/en/saudiarabia/riyadh/).

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Bahrain, you should be extremely careful. Unsafe driving practices, roaming animals and drifting sands can make driving hazardous, and off-road driving can be particularly dangerous. Always make sure your vehicle is well equipped and properly maintained. If you want to drive:

* Bring your Irish and/or international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance;
* There is zero tolerance to driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught;
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights; and

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

Please be aware that hired cars in this region often come with a daily travel limit (often 200km – 250km), beyond which you may have to pay a surcharge.
