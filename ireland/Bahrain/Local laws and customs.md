## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

It’s against the law for any Muslim to purchase alcohol from retail outlets.  There is zero tolerance for drunk driving.

### **Local culture**

Bahrain is a relatively liberal state in comparison to other countries in the region.  But some Bahrainis may find scanty clothing or immoderate behaviour in public offensive. It is best to dress conservatively, except within the confines of hotels or clubs, at least until you know your way around, and avoid public displays of affection.

Hotels may refuse accommodation to couples unable to provide proof of marriage.

### **Muslim culture**

Bahrain is a Muslim country so be sure to observe and respect religious and social sensitivities, especially during Ramadan as well as during other religious festivals when black flags and banners may be in evidence. Bahrainis observe a number of religious anniversaries that may not be celebrated in other Gulf countries.

### **LGBT**

While Bahraini law does not criminalise same sex-activity between consenting adults who are at least 21 years of age, sodomy is illegal and same sex activities are not socially accepted.  Given prevailing conservative attitudes in the region, caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Forbidden products**

You should not bring DVDs into the country, as these may be withheld on arrival at the airport.

### **Business activities**

If you’re involved in commercial disputes with Bahraini companies or individuals, you may be prevented from leaving the country until the dispute is resolved.
