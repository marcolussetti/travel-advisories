## Safety and security

### **Summer Music Festivals**

There is a major concert at the Hippodrome in Zagreb on 5 July 2025 which is expected to have record large attendance. Accommodation in Zagreb is already at very high occupancy during this time. We would advise to stay away from the area of the Hippodrome if you are not attending.

Croatia has numerous festivals throughout the summer. Please take note of travel advice below.

While you are at the festival:

* Always keep your valuables, including your passport, in a safe place.
* Keep some spare cash separate from the rest of your money and credit cards
* Don’t leave belongings unattended
* Stay with your friends, look out for each other and avoid walking back to your accommodation on your own.
* Police can issue on the spot fines for possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use ranging between €650 and €2,600
* To stay safe and comfortable at a music festival in hot weather, prioritize hydration, shade, and sun protection. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially if you're dancing or standing in lines, and avoid excessive alcohol. Seek shade during the hottest hours, wear light, loose-fitting clothing, and apply sunscreen regularly.

### **Landmines**

Landmines remain a very real danger in some parts of Croatia. Populated areas, major routes and almost all tourist sites are clear of mines and are safe to visit. However, isolated areas in the mountains and countryside have not all been cleared. Be careful not to stray from roads, paved areas or marked paths without an experienced guide and never enter areas that are taped off. You can get more information from the [**Croatian Mine Action Centre.**](https://welcome.cms.hr/index.php/en/mine-map/)

### **Crime**

Croatia is a relatively safe country. However, you should take sensible precautions when carrying passports and money in busy tourist areas.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Take special care of your valuables if you’re travelling by train, especially at night.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Croatia, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Zagreb if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Croatia, you should exercise caution and please note that vehicles are driven on the right hand side of the road. If you want to drive, you should visit the [**Croatian Automobile Club’s website**](http://www.hak.hr/en) and follow these guidelines:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Special seats are required for infants and children under twelve may not sit in the front seat of a car.
* Headlights (dipped beams) must be on at all times.
* Headlights must be on during winter time (i.e. outside the Daylight Savings Time period) as well as during the night or when visibility is poor.
* You must have winter tyres on the driving axle and carry snow chains in your vehicle during ‘winter conditions’. Either four winter or four summer tyres are obligatory, each with a minimum depth of 4mm of the rubber thread/slot.
* You must also have a fluorescent vest in the car (not the boot) while driving and to wear it if you have to leave your vehicle at any stage (e.g. a breakdown).
* Under Croatian law, it’s illegal for professional drivers (e.g. hauliers, taxi drivers, etc.) and young people (16-24 years) to drive with any alcohol in their system (there is also a zero tolerance policy for those in charge of yachts and boats). For other drivers, the blood/alcohol limit is 0.05.
* Police routinely spot check motorists for drinking and driving and will administer breath-analyser tests at the site of even the most minor accident. Drivers who refuse to submit to a breath analyser test are presumed to have been driving while intoxicated. Croatian police are obliged to take blood samples to test blood alcohol levels in the event of an accident resulting in death or serious injuries.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
