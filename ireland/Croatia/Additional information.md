## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to visit Croatia. While Croatia is a member of the Schengen Zone, Ireland is not. Please ensure that your passport is valid for the length of your stay. We advise you to carry electronic and/or paper copies of your passport at all times.

### **Registration**

If an Irish citizen is planning to stay for longer than 90 days in Croatia they are required to register temporary stay at their nearest local police station. While registering you will need to provide I.D., proof of accommodation for the duration of your stay, and the reason for your stay.

### **Money**

As of 1 January 2023, Croatia is a member of the Euro Zone. All major credit/debit cards are accepted in most banks and hotels. ATMs are widespread. If you have a Maestro or Cirrus symbol on your ATM cards, you can withdraw funds from your Irish account.
