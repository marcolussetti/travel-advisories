## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes**

Croatia is located in a seismic region. While earthquakes are uncommon and mostly minor, there have recently been larger incidents. If you are travelling to or living in Croatia, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Forest Fires**

Forest fires are very common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Outbreaks occur regularly and, although these are usually quickly brought under control by the Croatian Fire Service without travel disruption, it’s important to be aware of the potential outbreaks and remain alert.
