## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Buying Property**

Citizens and legal persons from EU member states are entitled to buy property in the Republic of Croatia under the same conditions as Croatian citizens. However, procedures around buying property often differ significantly from those in Ireland and you should research the matter thoroughly before entering into any agreement. If you’re intending to buy property in Croatia, we strongly advise you to consult an independent legal advisor from the beginning of the process and ensure there’s a clear title to ownership of the property in question. The Embassy can supply you with contact details for English-speaking legal advisors but they can’t offer any legal or administrative advice on buying property in Croatia.

### **Registration**

You must register with the local police within 48 hours of arriving in Croatia. You can usually do this through your accommodation - hotels, guesthouses and other accommodation services including campsites, are obliged to register their guests. There’s a standard fee of around €1 usually charged on your accommodation bill for this service. You can also register at the local police station, or at tourist offices in cities and large towns. Failure to register may result in a fine of up to €500 or in being forced to leave Croatia. You can get more information on registration from the Ministry of Interior.

### **Money**

As of 1 January 2023, Croatia is a member of the Euro Zone. All major credit/debit cards are accepted in most banks and hotels. ATMs are widespread. If you have a Maestro or Cirrus symbol on your ATM cards, you can withdraw funds from your Irish account.
