### **Earthquakes**

Georgia is in an area of seismic activity so if travelling to or living in Georgia, make sure travellers know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

In 2002, an earthquake in Tbilisi, with a magnitude between 4.3 and 6.0 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of six people and some serious infrastructural damage.

In 2009, an earthquake measuring 6.2 struck 156km north-west of Tbilisi.
