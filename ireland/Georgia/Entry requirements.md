## Entry requirements

### **Mandatory travel insurance**

As of 1 January 2026, all tourists entering Georgia are required to hold a **valid health and accident (travel) insurance** policy. All tourists are required to present evidence of a valid travel insurance policy in either physical or electronic form, in Georgian or English. The insurance policy may be issued by either a Georgian or a foreign insurance company, and the insurance coverage amount must be no less than 30 000 GEL. The insurance policy is required to cover the full period of your stay in Georgia, including both arrival and departure dates, and contain the following mandatory information:

- Parties to the insurance contract

- Covered territory

- Subject matter of the insurance

- Commencement and expiration dates of the insurance coverage

- Insured risks

- Amount of the insurance sum (limits)

- Amount of the insurance premium, place and terms of payment.

### **Entry requirements**

Irish and EU nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia. Travellers can visit for up to 90 days within a period of 180 days. The nearest Georgian Embassy can be contacted for more details or clarification on entry requirements.

If staying longer than 90 days, travellers should apply for a temporary or permanent residency permit from the Civil Registration Agency of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. Overstaying a residency permit can result in immediate deportation and a ban on re-entering Georgian territory for up to one year.

The Embassy cannot intervene in decisions by Georgian immigration authorities.

The Embassy is aware of recent reports of a small number of foreign citizens who have been denied entry to Georgia or have had issues leaving. These cases are reportedly linked to alleged presence at or participation in political demonstrations, and unpaid fines.

### **Passports**

Passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months, but preferably 6 months from date of entry and also should be valid for entire stay in Georgia.

It is advisable that child passport photos match the child’s current appearance. The Embassy is aware of reports of some foreign families being denied entry due to their child’s passport photo no longer matching their current appearance.

### **Travelling with Children**

If travelling to Georgia with a child other than their own, travellers must have evidence of the consent of the child’s parents or guardians.
