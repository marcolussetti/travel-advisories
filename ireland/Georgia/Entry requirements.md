## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish and EU nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia. Travellers can visit for up to 90 days within a period of 180 days. Visit the [**Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website**](http://www.mfa.gov.ge/Home.aspx?lang_id=GEO&sec_id=607&month=11&year=2011&lang=en-US) for more details on entry requirements and how the new rules might affect travellers.

If staying longer than 90 days, travellers should apply for a temporary or permanent residency permit from the Civil Registration Agency of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. Overstaying a residency permit can result in immediate deportation and a ban on re-entering Georgian territory for up to one year.

### **Passports**

Passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months, but preferably 6 months from date of entry and also should be valid for entire stay in Georgia.

### **Travelling with Children**

If travelling to Georgia with a child other than their own, travellers must have evidence of the consent of the childâ€™s parents or guardians.
