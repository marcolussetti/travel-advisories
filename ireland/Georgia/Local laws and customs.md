## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to travellers and it is their responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photography**

Avoid photographing sensitive sites such as military bases and installations and always be aware of cultural sensitivities when visiting and photographing religious sites. If in doubt, always ask permission before taking a photograph.

### **LGBTQI+**

Although LGBTQI+ persons are legally protected from discrimination in Georgia, there is a large degree of intolerance among the general population and LGBTQI+ persons often experience targeted abuse; be careful about public displays of affection. A “Family Values” law banning Pride events, public displays of the rainbow flag, and enabling censorship of LGBTQI+ related films and books entered into force in September 2014.
