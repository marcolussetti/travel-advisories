## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to travellers and it is their responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Assisted Human Reproduction (Surrogacy)**

The Department of Foreign Affairs urges caution in respect of undertaking a surrogacy arrangement in Georgia. Issues around surrogacy are complex and fact specific. Irish citizens should obtain independent and comprehensive legal advice before entering into any arrangement. In case of a query, intending parents should email the Honorary Consul in Georgia, copying the Embassy of Ireland in Türkiye.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photography**

Avoid photographing sensitive sites such as military bases and installations and always be aware of cultural sensitivities when visiting and photographing religious sites. If in doubt, always ask permission before taking a photograph.

### **LGBTQI+**

Although LGBTQI+ persons are legally protected from discrimination in Georgia, there is a large degree of intolerance among the general population and LGBTQI+ persons often experience targeted abuse; be careful about public displays of affection. A “Family Values” law banning Pride events, public displays of the rainbow flag, and enabling censorship of LGBTQI+ related films and books entered into force in September 2014.

### **Money**

According to Georgian law, all goods and services should be paid for in local currency (Georgian Lari) although prices are often quoted in US dollars. Lari can not be bought outside the country but US dollars and Euro can easily be exchanged for the local currency.

Avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Credit cards are increasingly being used in Georgia and ATMs can be found in major cities. Traveller’s cheques are not widely accepted.
