## Safety and security

### **Demonstrations**

Protests continue to occur frequently in Georgia and can potentially turn confrontational or escalate. We therefore advise to avoid areas where large demonstrations and rallies are gathered as situations can develop rapidly. We recommend that travellers remain aware of what is going on in their surroundings and keep checking local media reports.

### **South Ossetia and Abkhazia**

The political situation in Georgia has stabilised since the 2008 conflict with Russia but it is still fragile. The separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain in the control of Russian forces and we advise against attempts to travel there. We also advise against all but essential travel to the areas near the Administrative Boundary Lines (ABLs) of these regions as sporadic attacks and incidents can still take place. There are reports of unexploded ordinance these areas and they should be avoided until they have been confirmed clear.

### **Border Crossings**

Do not attempt to enter or leave Georgia via the land borders with the Russian Federation (i.e. Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, North Ossetia) under any circumstances. The border crossing between the Russian Federation and unoccupied Georgia at Verkhny Lars is not open to tourists.

It is illegal to enter Georgia via Abkhazia or South Ossetia as there is no official border control. If travellers do so they may face criminal prosecution, which carries a prison sentence of up to four years. If the passport contains entry/exit stamps from the separatist Abkhazian or South Ossetian authorities, the Georgian authorities may consider this as illegal entry into Georgia via an unrecognised border crossing.

### **Crime**

Although Tbilisi itself is considered to be a relatively safe city, normal precautions should be taken when visiting the tourist areas and areas frequented by foreigners:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry a passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of the passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home. Ensure that at least one family member in Ireland is aware of your location and travel plans in Georgia. Should an emergency arise communications by email or mobile phone can be difficult.
* There have been reports of muggings near Narikala Fortress and Mother Georgia in Tbilisi and we recommend that travellers do not walk alone in this area.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as trains and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Do not leave valuables, or bags that may appear to contain valuables, visible in parked cars.
* Exercise a high level of vigilance in bars, nightclubs and any crowded areas where food and drink are consumed. Spiking of food and drink with drugs can occur. Always keep your drink with you and avoid accepting food or drinks from strangers or new acquaintances. If you do begin to feel strange or unwell, contact a trusted friend straight away who should help take you to a safe place such as the hotel or accommodation where you are staying.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Georgia, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at the [**Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Türkiye**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/turkiye/ankara/) if help is needed.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Georgia, be extremely careful. Driving in Georgia can be quite erratic and unpredictable manoeuvres, sudden overtaking and speeding are common. We recommend avoiding driving at night if at all possible. If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence or an international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Be aware of Georgia’s traffic laws, such as speed limits, which in urban areas is 60km/hr and 80km/hr outside, unless otherwise indicated.
* Children under seven years of age are required to sit in child-safety seats.
* Many of the roads in Georgia are poorly lit and can be badly marked.
* Heavy rain and flooding often affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas). When travelling outside of Tbilisi vehicles should be suitably equipped to deal with a range of adverse situations.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over passports as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in sight at all times.

Check that travellers have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Pedestrians**

Pedestrians should exercise particular caution, even at marked pedestrian crossings, as cars often do not give way.

### **Taxis**

If using taxis in Tbilisi, and other cities, it is safer to use licensed taxis. Not all taxis are metered. If travellers find themselves in an unmetered taxi, travellers should agree the price for the journey before starting. If staying in a hotel, we recommend to book a taxi through the hotel reception.

### **Air Safety**

Where possible, fly directly to Tbilisi on a scheduled international flight. Among the International airlines serving Georgia are Austrian Airlines, BMI British Midlands, Czech Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines.

### **Mountaineering**

It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions in Georgia and if travellers encounter difficulties while mountaineering or hiking, it may be difficult to organise the level of emergency/rescue assistance that travellers would expect in more developed tourist destinations.

If considering trekking or mountaineering we advise travellers to contact Georgian companies that provide specialist guides. Please ensure that travellers inform someone of their contact details, itinerary and expected return time.
