## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish and EU nationals do not need a visa to enter Georgia. Travellers can visit for up to 90 days within a period of 180 days. Visit the [**Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website**](http://www.mfa.gov.ge/Home.aspx?lang_id=GEO&sec_id=607&month=11&year=2011&lang=en-US) for more details on entry requirements and how the new rules might affect travellers.

If staying longer than 90 days, travellers should apply for a temporary or permanent residency permit from the Civil Registration Agency of the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. Overstaying a residency permit can result in immediate deportation and a ban on re-entering Georgian territory for up to one year.

Passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months, but preferably 6 months from date of entry and also should be valid for entire stay in Georgia.

### **Travelling with children**

If travelling to Georgia with a child other than their own, travellers must have evidence of the consent of the child’s parents or guardians.

### **Air quality**

If travellers have respiratory issues, make sure you bring any necessary inhalers with you on your trip, as the air in Tbilisi can be difficult at times.

### **Water**

The Embassy recommends to avoid drinking tap water.

### **Money**

According to Georgian law, all goods and services should be paid for in local currency (Georgian Lari) although prices are often quoted in US dollars. Lari can not be bought outside the country but US dollars and Euro can easily be exchanged for the local currency.

Avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Credit cards are increasingly being used in Georgia and ATMs can be found in major cities. Traveller’s cheques are not widely accepted.

### **Earthquakes**

Georgia is in an area of seismic activity so if travelling to or living in Georgia, make sure travellers know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

In 2002, an earthquake in Tbilisi, with a magnitude between 4.3 and 6.0 on the Richter scale, resulted in the deaths of six people and some serious infrastructural damage.

In 2009, an earthquake measuring 6.2 struck 156km north-west of Tbilisi.
