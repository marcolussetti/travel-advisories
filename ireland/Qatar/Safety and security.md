## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

There are ongoing regional tensions and, in the event of any incident, you should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. The political situation in Qatar is generally stable.

### **Terrorism**

Visitors should be aware that there is a degree of threat from terrorism generally in the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and against Western interests.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Qatar but take sensible precautions. If a victim of a crime while in Qatar, report it to the local police immediately. [Contact the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/) if you need help.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) in your hotel or with family or friends at home.
* Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare but do happen. Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the attacker was known to the victim. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, both parties may face prosecution for the offence of sex outside marriage. Drink spiking can occur. Do not accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.

### **Social Media and Photography**

Qatar has strict laws regarding online behaviour, including comments made via social media, with offences punishable by fines, imprisonment and deportation. Sharing videos or photographs of others through social media can be a punishable offence. Visitors should stay away from military sites â€“ taking photos of military or security installations, and some public buildings is prohibited. Avoid filming or photographing people without their permission.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Qatar, be extremely careful. Road safety standards are low, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by speeding, poor driving and inadequate lighting.

Drivers involved in an accident causing injuries may be detained until the injured party is released from hospital. In an accident causing injuries or fatalities, those found at fault may be legally required to provide financial compensation to the injured or the family of the deceased.

Visitors should exercise great care as a pedestrian and only cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings. Drivers often fail to stop for pedestrians at zebra crossings.

Offensive gestures and bad language can lead to fines, a jail sentence and deportation.

Excursions to the desert can be dangerous, especially without adequately equipped 4 x 4 vehicles. Serious accidents can occur when driving on sand dunes in the desert, which can result in death. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.

If you want to drive:

* Bring an international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* It is illegal to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount, and your insurance is likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident. The penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be severe.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Water Safety**

Rip currents can occur at any beach and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea. Always comply with warning signs and only swim at approved beaches. Only swim at pools with a lifeguard in attendance, and always check and ensure that there are qualified lifeguards present if children are swimming as part of their school activities or at summer camps.

The safety of tourist boats may not be up to Irish standards. Ensure that life jackets are available for all passengers.
