## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Be aware of the threat from terrorism generally in the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and against Western interests.

### **Crime**

Most visits to Qatar are trouble-free and there is a relatively low incidence of crime. However, take the usual sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of passport (and travel and insurance documents) in hotel or with family or friends at home. Make sure to have a screen shot of your passport on your phone.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Qatar, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Qatar, be careful. Standards of driving are low. Roaming animals and drifting sands are additional road hazards.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and an  international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* There is a zero-tolerance policy on drink driving in Qatar. Offenders may be detained, fined and banned from driving

### **Off-road driving**

Off-road driving, particularly trips to the desert, can be hazardous unless in a well-equipped and properly maintained 4 x 4 vehicle. Always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
