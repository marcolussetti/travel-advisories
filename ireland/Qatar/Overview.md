For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Qatar is a Muslim country with a diverse resident population. Laws and customs are different to those in Ireland and other Western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in Qatar. Please note that if visitors experience any legal difficulty, either civil or criminal, while in Qatar, they are likely to be subject to a travel ban until the issue is fully resolved. Timings related to the resolution of legal issues are not consistent and may not be prompt. See the Local Laws and Customs section for more information. Visitors to Qatar are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Citizens are encouraged to also follow the Embassy of Ireland, Abu Dhabi on social media ([**X**](https://x.com/IrelandEmbUAE), [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandEmbUAE/)**,** [**Instagram**](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiU7NrMpM2LAxUTQUEAHV2POlgQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Firelandembuae%2F%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AOvVaw3lH1PDscX4yD-bMNp6pdBp&opi=89978449)**, and** [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/embassy-of-ireland-abu-dhabi?originalSubdomain=ae)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Important Information**

Please note that in Qatar defaulting on the repayment of loans or the non-settlement of bills is taken very seriously. A criminal case is often filed resulting in a travel ban. Individuals in such circumstances are not permitted to leave Qatar. Ensure that any personal debt is fully paid before you leave Qatar. Failure to do so may impact your ability to transit through Qatar in the future.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Please note that if you misplace your passport while in Qatar, there is a very good chance it will be handed into lost and found. Please retrace your steps and contact the relevant authorities (e.g., restaurants, hotels, taxi companies etc.). If unable to find your misplaced passport, please contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/).

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Qatar by dialling 999.
