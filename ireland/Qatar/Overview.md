Irish citizens can obtain a free 30-day visa waiver to enter the country on arrival in Qatar.

A valid passport is required for travel to Qatar. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on  the entry and exit requirements, please see the Additional Information tab.

All travellers entering Qatar are required to obtain health insurance with any insurance company that is registered with the Ministry of Public Health. You can get your health insurance on arrival. However, we strongly advise securing health insurance before travelling.

Visitors must purchase an insurance policy from a registered Ministry of Public Health insurance provider, the premium for the Mandatory Visitors’ Health Insurance policy is QAR 50 per month.

A list of registered insurance providers can be found [**here.**](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/hirs/insurancecompanies/Pages/default.aspx)

Passengers should check with their airline carrier or travel company for the latest information if they are planning to transit through Qatar. Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.

Qatar is a Muslim country. Laws and customs are very different to those in Ireland and other western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in Qatar. There can be serious penalties, including custodial sentences, for doing something that may not be illegal in Ireland. See Local Laws and Customs tab.

Visitors to Qatar are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Qatar by dialling 999.
