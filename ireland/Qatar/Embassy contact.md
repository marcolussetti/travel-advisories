## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Qatar, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi**](/en/uae/abudhabi/).

If emergency assistance is required from the Embassy in Abu Dhabi, contact us immediately. Our telephone number is: +971 (0) 2 4958200.

If emergency assistance is required at the weekend or on a public holiday, leave a message on the answering machine. The answering machine is monitored regularly, and the Duty Officer at the Embassy will contact you as soon as possible. When leaving a message, remember to state your name, the nature of the problem, and the details of how the Duty Officer can contact you (e.g. leave your mobile phone number or the phone number of the hotel/hostel where you are staying). If necessary, contact the police also. Please note that the Duty Officer will deal with emergencies only.

Monday - Thursday 09:00-13:00
