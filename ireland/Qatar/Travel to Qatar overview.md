#### **Security Situation in the Middle East and Gulf Region**

**In light of the current security situation in the Middle East and Gulf region, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises Irish citizens against all but essential travel to Qatar until further notice.**

Irish citizens in Qatar should shelter in place, avoid unnecessary movement, and follow the advice of the local authorities. Irish citizens are also advised to avoid military and security force installations.

There is significant disruption to travel across the Middle East and Gulf regions. Citizens traveling through or to these regions should contact their airline directly.

Irish citizens in need of consular assistance should contact the Embassy of Ireland in the United Arab Emirates on +971 024 958 200.

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

Irish citizens in Qatar should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

For further updates, please monitor the Department’s travel advice and social media channels, as well as the Embassy of Ireland's social media channels on [**X**](https://x.com/IrelandEmbUAE), [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/irelandembuae?igsh=bnRnYjQ0Mmt4OG50), and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/share/1Aek6yo4tR/?mibextid=wwXIfr)**.**

#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens can obtain a free 30-day visa waiver to enter the country on arrival in Qatar.

A valid passport is required for travel to Qatar. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Irish passport cards cannot be used to enter Qatar.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Qatar is a Muslim country with a diverse resident population. Laws and customs are different to those in Ireland and other Western countries. It is important to respect local customs, laws, and religions while in Qatar. Please note that if visitors experience any legal difficulty, either civil or criminal, while in Qatar, they are likely to be subject to a travel ban until the issue is fully resolved. Timings related to the resolution of legal issues are not consistent and may not be prompt. See the Local Laws and Customs section for more information. Visitors to Qatar are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Citizens are encouraged to also follow the Embassy of Ireland, Abu Dhabi on social media ([**X**](https://x.com/IrelandEmbUAE), [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandEmbUAE/)**,** [**Instagram**](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiU7NrMpM2LAxUTQUEAHV2POlgQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Firelandembuae%2F%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AOvVaw3lH1PDscX4yD-bMNp6pdBp&opi=89978449)**, and** [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/embassy-of-ireland-abu-dhabi?originalSubdomain=ae)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Important Information**

Please note that in Qatar defaulting on the repayment of loans or the non-settlement of bills is taken very seriously. A criminal case is often filed resulting in a travel ban. Individuals in such circumstances are not permitted to leave Qatar. Ensure that any personal debt is fully paid before you leave Qatar. Failure to do so may impact your ability to transit through Qatar in the future.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Please note that if you misplace your passport while in Qatar, there is a very good chance it will be handed into lost and found. Please retrace your steps and contact the relevant authorities (e.g., restaurants, hotels, taxi companies etc.). If unable to find your misplaced passport, please contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Abu Dhabi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/).

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Qatar by dialling 999.
