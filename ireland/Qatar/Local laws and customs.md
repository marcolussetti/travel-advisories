## Local laws and customs

### **Muslim Culture**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Qatar is an Islamic country and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

Dress conservatively. Clothes should cover the tops of the arms and legs and underwear should not be visible.

Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public. Sex outside of marriage is illegal, as is cohabitation, adultery and homosexual behaviour. If you conduct a sexual relationship outside heterosexual marriage you run the risk of prosecution, imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation. Private life is respected in Qatar, however, people are punished for sexual activity outside marriage where there is a public element or if it is brought to the attention of the police authorities.

If you become pregnant outside of marriage, both you and your partner could face imprisonment and/or deportation. Doctors may ask for proof of marriage during ante-natal checks. An unmarried woman who gives birth in Qatar may also encounter problems when registering the birth of the child in Qatar and could face arrest, imprisonment or deportation. To obtain a birth certificate from the Qatari authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate and the authorities may compare the date of the marriage against the estimated date of conception.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Sharia Law**

Sharia law is an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties under Sharia law can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. We advise you to respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities. Travellers should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, arms and head.

### **LGBT**

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Qatar, and same-sex marriages are not recognised. Qatar is in many respects a tolerant society and private life is respected. However, there have been reports of individuals being punished for same-sex sexual activity, particularly where there is any public element, or where the behaviour has caused offence. This applies to foreign national residents and tourists.

### **Alcohol**

Only licensed hotels, restaurants and bars can sell alcohol. Expatriates living in Qatar can get alcohol on a permit system. Donâ€™t carry alcohol around with you (except to take it on the day of collection from the warehouse to your home). The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. Places serving alcohol will ask for original photo IDs (copies are not accepted) upon entry.

It is illegal to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. For example, if you drink alcohol in a non-licenced public place, you could get a prison sentence of up to 6 months or a fine up to 3,000 Qatari riyals.

### **Illegal Drugs**

There is zero tolerance for drug-related offences.

The penalties for drug trafficking, smuggling and possession are severe. Drug trafficking penalties can include the death sentence or life imprisonment. Travellers who transit in Qatar airports are subject to these laws. Qatari airports have excellent technology and security, so transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested.

### **Forbidden Materials**

Bringing alcohol, drugs, pork products and pornographic books and material into Qatar is forbidden. Videos, books and magazines are subject to scrutiny and may be censored. Qatar law also prohibits the importation, sale and purchase of electronic cigarettes, liquids and other similar products (e.g., electronic shisha pipes).

### **Criminal Offences**

Financial crimes, including fraud, bouncing cheques and the non-payment of bills, is regarded very seriously in Qatar and can often result in imprisonment and/or a fine. Non-residents of Qatar who are arrested for crimes involving fraud do not generally get bail. Convicted debtors will not usually be released from jail until the debt is paid or waived. Several Irish citizens have received custodial sentences as a result of non-payment of outstanding debts.

Swearing and making rude gestures (including online) are considered obscene acts and can lead to prosecution. Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.

Protesting is illegal in Qatar. Anyone breaking the law in Qatar is likely to be taken into custody and a travel ban applied.

Conditions in prisons in Qatar are mixed, and can at times be very poor.
