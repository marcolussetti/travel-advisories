## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

The climate in Qatar is hot and dry most of the year. Take appropriate precautions to prevent sunburn andÂ dehydration, remembering that during Ramadan it is an offence to eat or drink in public between sunrise and sunset.

### **Sandstorms**

There are occasional sandstorms but although they may restrict visibility, they are not usually severe enough to affect daily life.
