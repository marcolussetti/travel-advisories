### **Prescription Medicines**

If bringing controlled/prescription medication into Qatar, the medicine should be in its original packaging and carry your original prescription. Avoid carrying large quantities of controlled or prescription medication. Some medicines available on prescription or over the counter elsewhere could be considered illegal in Qatar. If in doubt, check with the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Qatar.**](https://www.mofa.gov.qa/en)
