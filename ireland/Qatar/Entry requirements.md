## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens can obtain a free 30 day visa waiver on arrival in Qatar.

If unsure of what the entry requirements for Qatar are, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Qatar**](https://mofa.gov.qa/en)**.** Information on entry visas for Qatar can also be found on the [**Qatar Ministry of Interior website.**](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/qatarvisas/)

### **Passport**

Passports should be valid for a minimum remaining period of six months to enter Qatar. A longer period of validity may be required if you intend to seek a Qatari residency visa. If you hold a Qatari residence permit, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months in order to travel into the country.

### **Exit requirements**

Visitors must have legal status in Qatar when they depart. If your residency visa is under process, have overstayed your visa, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt or are a child subject to a custody dispute, you may be prevented from leaving the country. A number of Irish nationals have been arrested when departing or transiting Qatar, including as a result of unpaid debts in the country.
