### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Djibouti.

A tourist visa may be purchased on arrival with cash (USD is accepted). You may also apply [**online**](https://www.evisa.gouv.dj/) or by contacting a Djiboutian Embassy.

A valid passport is required for travel to Djibouti. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry into Djibouti. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Djibouti are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia on Twitter@[**IrlEmbEthiopia**](https://twitter.com/irlembethiopia) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Djibouti by dialling the following numbers from a local phone:

* Police: 17

Due to the ongoing threat of terrorism and the volatile security situation in the wider region, we advise you exercise a high degree of caution in Djibouti, avoid large crowds and monitor local media.

**We advise against all travel to the area bordering Eritrea** due to ongoing tensions between the two countries. There is also a danger from uncleared landmines in these areas.

As there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Djibouti, we’re limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, please contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa**](/en/ethiopia/addisababa/).
