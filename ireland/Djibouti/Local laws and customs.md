## Local laws and customs

Djibouti is a predominantly Muslim country and you are likely to be expected to dress and behave in a conservative manner.

### **Alcohol and Drugs**

Drinking alcohol in Djibouti is permitted, but drunken behaviour could result in a two-year prison term. Convictions for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs carry long prison sentences or heavy fines. Note that the narcotic khat, while legal in Djibouti, is illegal in many other countries, and should not be carried out of the country.

### **Homosexuality**

There are no legal restrictions on homosexuality in Djibouti, though the subject is somewhat taboo among Djiboutians. However, public displays of affection, such as kissing or hand-holding by same-sex couples, carry a risk of prosecution by authorities under laws prohibiting attacks on “good morals”.

### **Photography**

There are a high number of military installations in Djibouti, and travellers should be aware that photographing infrastructure, including military facilities, ports, airports, bridges and public buildings is prohibited. Care should be taken when photographing near prohibited locations.

### **Money**

Djibouti is largely a cash-based economy. The Djiboutian Franc is the official currency. Credit cards are accepted at major hotels and supermarkets, but note that Visa is much more widely accepted than Mastercard. ATMs are available in Djibouti City, again Visa more widely accepted. You should ensure that you carry sufficient hard currency.
