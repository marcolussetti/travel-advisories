## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Djibouti.

A tourist visa may be purchased on arrival with cash (USD is accepted). You may also apply [**online**](https://www.evisa.gouv.dj/) or by contacting a Djiboutian Embassy.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Djibouti. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry into Djibouti.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Djibouti and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad you should contact the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia. We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
