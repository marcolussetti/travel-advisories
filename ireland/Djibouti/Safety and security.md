## Safety and security

### **Crime**

While Djibouti is relatively safe, petty crime can occur. Take the usual precautions – avoid walking around the city alone late at night, and keep valuables, particularly jewellery, cameras and passports, out of sight.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Djibouti, be advised that driving standards are generally poor and speeding and unsafe driving are common. Drivers should stick to paved roads where possible. Driving outside city centres after dark should be avoided – vehicles often do not have lights, and there may be pedestrians and livestock on the roads.

### **Terrorism**

There is a risk of terrorism in Djibouti, which could be indiscriminate and targeted at public areas frequented by foreigners, including hotels and shopping areas. Irish citizens should be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and during major gatherings like sporting or religious events.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Djibouti, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa**](/en/ethiopia/addisababa/) if you need help.
