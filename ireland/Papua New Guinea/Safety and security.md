## Safety and security

### **Demonstrations**

Avoid protests and other large public gatherings in Port Moresby and other major towns as they can turn violent. Always keep yourself informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media for information about potential conflicts or the security or political situation of specific areas and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Highland Provinces**

Inter-tribal disturbances can happen without warning in the Highland Provinces, in particular the Southern Highlands and Enga Provinces. Be extremely careful, as law enforcement in these areas is weak.

### **Bougainville Province**

Bougainville Province (including Bougainville Island) has recently emerged from a period of separatist conflict. Do not enter the mountainous area in central Bougainville around the old Panguna mine as it is a ‘No Go Zone’. Foreigners who have entered the Zone without authorisation from the Papua New Guinean government have been questioned by the authorities and had their passports confiscated on departure from the Zone.

### **Landmines**

Unexploded ordnance and landmines are present in many islands, including Bougainville and East New Britain.

Avoid walking or hiking off marked roads and trails.

### **Crime**

Crime is common in Papua New Guinea, especially personal crime. It tends to be opportunistic and can happen anywhere and at any time. However, it is especially prevalent in areas such as Lae, Mt Hagen and other parts of the Highland provinces and the capital city Port Moresby is particularly dangerous. We advise visitors to be extremely careful and take sensible precautions:

Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place

Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home

Avoid walking after dark in Port Moresby and other urban areas. If travelling at night, do so by car. There have been serious attacks and robberies along the Kokoda Track.

Rape, kidnapping, and sexual assault are problems across the country. There is particular risk where law enforcement is weak, such as in the Northern and Southern Highlands, and the Enga Provinces.

Violence and use of 'bush knives' (machetes) and guns often accompany assault and robberies. Car-jacking, assaults, bag-snatching and other robberies, including in shops and restaurants, are common.

If arrested or detained, you are entitled to request that the local police notify the Embassy of your detention.

Criminals tend to target areas and establishments often frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants and bars, places of worship and tourist areas.

Criminals may use roadblocks outside of towns to stop and loot vehicles and attack you. Keep doors and windows locked, including when travelling by vehicle, consider using private security and avoid travel by taxi or public transport, especially if you are a woman.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

Always keep your travel documents secure at all times. If your passport is lost or stolen, getting a replacement can take some time, given the distance between Papua New Guinea and the nearest Irish Embassy in Canberra. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if you can provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Papua New Guinea, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at the Irish Embassy in Canberra, in Australia if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Papua New Guinea, be extremely careful. Driving is on the left. Roads are generally poor, particularly outside towns and cities and standards of driving are erratic. If you want to drive, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance. Ensure that rental aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition.

### **Car Jacking**

Car jacking is a risk of travelling in Papua New Guinea. Always keep car doors locked and windows closed, particularly if travelling at night or through urban areas.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public Buses (PMVs)**

We recommend that visitors avoid using public buses known locally as PMVs. There have been incidents of armed hold-ups of PMVs and of passengers being attacked and robbed of their personal belongings. Many PMVs are considered to be un-roadworthy.

### **Taxis**

Taxis are available in some major centres, but they can be badly maintained, and you should check about their reliability with your hotel or guesthouse. If visitors use a taxi, make sure to agree a fare before getting into the vehicle, even if there is a meter.

### **Kokoda Track**

If visitors intend to walk a trail or track in Papua New Guinea, particularly on the Kokoda Track, we strongly advise to travel with guides from a reputable tour company and pay the relevant fees before you set out. Visitors can get details through the Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority or the Kokoda Track Authority. Although community leaders have assured tourists of their safety and well-being while walking the Kokoda Track, there have been serious attacks and robberies at both ends of the Track and visitors should be cautious.

### **Flying**

Flying in Papua New Guinea carries an increased level of risk due to the poor condition of airfields, remote locations, difficult terrain, extreme weather and poor maintenance of aircraft.
