## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes**

Papua New Guinea is in an active seismic zone and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen regularly, particularly around Rabaul, Bougainville, West New Britain and the Manam Islands. If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Tsunami**

Depending on the severity and conditions of the seismic activity in the region, there may be a threat of tsunamis. If travelling to coastal areas, be alert for tsunami warnings that may be issued by the authorities.

### **Wet season**

During the wet season in Papua New Guinea (November to May) weather can damage infrastructure (roads, airstrips), cause flooding and landslides and contribute to the spread of infectious disease. Take care if travelling during this time; talk to your tour guides or follow the local media to see whether travel may be affected.

### **Volcanoes**

Papua New Guinea has a number of active and extinct volcanoes.

* Mount Ulawun Volcano, on the island of New Britain, erupted three times in 2019 causing airport closures. A brief eruption occurred on 2 June 2022.
* Mount Bagana in Bougainville erupted on 13 August 2019.
* Manam Island volcano, one of Papua New Guineaâ€™s most active, erupted on 25 August 2018 forcing thousands to flee to the mainland. Further low level activity has occurred since then, most recently in April 2022.
* Kadovar Island volcano erupted in January 2018, leading to an evacuation of the island. If planning travel in affected areas, check with your travel provider or airline before travelling.
