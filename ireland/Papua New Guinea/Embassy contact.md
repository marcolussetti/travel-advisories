## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Papua New Guinea, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Australia.

If emergency assistance is required from the Embassy, please contact us on +61 2 62140000

Outside normal working hours please contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000
