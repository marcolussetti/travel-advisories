## Health

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations for Papua New Guinea are required. Be aware that if you have a compromised immune system you may be at greater risk of falling ill or contracting disease while travelling in this country.

### **HIV and AIDS**

HIV and AIDs are increasingly common in Papua New Guinea, so we strongly encourage victims of violence, particularly victims of sexual assault, to seek immediate medical assistance.

### **Cholera**

Cholera is endemic in Papua New Guinea so visitors need to take precautions; only drink ‘safe’ chlorinated or boiled water and avoid ice-cubes or uncooked food. Maintain high personal hygiene standards such as washing your hands frequently.

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Mosquito-borne diseases are present in Papua New Guinea and visitors should get up-to-date medical advice about immunisations and prophylaxis before travelling. Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Other Diseases**

Food and water-borne diseases are also common, as is tuberculosis. Swimming in Papua New Guinea may expose you to water-borne parasites, particularly if swimming in rivers. Stings from marine animals are also a risk and can be fatal.
