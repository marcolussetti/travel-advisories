## Safety and security

Most visits to North Macedonia are trouble-free and attacks on foreigners are extremely rare.

Nevertheless, visitors to North Macedonia are advised to take normal personal and security precautions, particularly at night.

* Valuables and other items such as spare jewellery, passports, driving licences, credit/debit cards and excess cash should be secured in a hotel safe.
* For identification purposes, visitors should carry a copy of their passport at all times (bring a few spare photocopies of the personal details page).
* Pickpockets and bag snatchers often operate in crowded areas.

### **Borders**

Exercise particular caution if travelling to areas bordering Kosovo or Serbia. Apart from designated border crossings, these areas are restricted and travel permission must be obtained from the police. In some remote areas there may be a continuing threat from land mines or unexploded ordnance.

The border between North Macedonia and Kosovo can be subject to closure to traffic at short notice. Kosovo entry/exit stamps in passports can lead to additional scrutiny checks at Macedonian or other local borders.
