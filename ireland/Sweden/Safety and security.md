## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

As of 05 June 2025, the threat level for terrorism in Sweden is currently assessed by the Swedish authorities as being at level three (out of five). Level three means that the Swedish National Centre for Terrorist Threat Assessment (NCT) assesses the probability that actors have the intention and ability to carry out attacks to be **elevated.**

The Swedish Government has advised the general public to remain alert and to report any suspicious activity to the Swedish authorities. The Embassy of Ireland in Sweden asks its citizens to adhere fully to the advice of the Swedish authorities on security matters. The Embassy continues to closely monitor the situation. Further information from the Swedish authorities can be found [**here**](https://www.krisinformation.se/en).

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Sweden but you should take sensible precautions.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible

### **Reporting a Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Sweden, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy if you need help.

In an emergency you can call 112 and ask to speak to the police. The operator will be able to speak English. In non-emergency situations, you can report a crime to the nearest police station or call 114 14 to file a police report.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in Sweden are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained. Be aware that conditions can be hazardous, especially in winter, when you should equip your car for the severe climate.

* Bring your full Irish driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. Alcohol levels equal to or more than 0.1 milligrams of alcohol per litre of breath can result in imprisonment for a maximum of 24 months
* Be aware of Sweden’s traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Winter tyres are obligatory from 1 December to 1 April each year, but you must drive with your headlights on at all times throughout the entire year
* Drivers are obliged to give priority to pedestrians at all times
* When driving in Sweden, particularly in the north of the country, wild animals straying on the roads, such as deer and elk, can be an added danger
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Pedestrians**

You should be aware that the traffic will be coming from the opposite direction to traffic in Ireland. Be extra careful at night when walking along roads without a proper pavement and when crossing roads, even at a designated crossing place.
