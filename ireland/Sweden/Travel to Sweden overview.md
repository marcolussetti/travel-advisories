### **Travel Alert**

As of 5 June 2025, the Swedish authorities have decreased the terrorism threat level in Sweden to level three – an elevated threat. An elevated threat level still includes the possibility that a terrorist attack could occur. The Swedish Government encourages all people in Sweden to remain alert, to monitor reliable local media sources for the most recent information and to follow the instructions issued by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency available [**here**](https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/terrorism). For more information, see the Safety and Security tab.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Sweden.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Sweden. However, if you are going to be resident in Sweden for at least one year, you must contact [**the Swedish Tax Agency**](https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglishengelska/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden.4.7be5268414bea064694c40c.html) to register in the population register. If you are going to work and live in Sweden but do not meet the requirements to be registered in the population register, you can apply for [**a coordination number**](https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglishengelska/individualsandemployees/coordinationnumbers.4.1657ce2817f5a993c3a7d2a.html) from the Swedish Tax Agency.

Visitors to Sweden are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of any current issues on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbSweden**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbSweden); [**Facebook**](https://m.facebook.com/IrishEmbSweden) and [**LinkedIn**](https://se.linkedin.com/company/irishembsweden)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
