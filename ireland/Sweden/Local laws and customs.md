## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

The Swedish authorities have little tolerance for public drunkenness and police have the right to detain people they judge to be very intoxicated.

### **Cash/Banking**

Swedish Krona is the official currency of Sweden. Major credit cards are widely accepted, but cheques are not.
