### **General Travel Advice**

Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. Irish citizens require an [**ESTA**](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/esta) or visa to enter the US.

In advance of travel, an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation) application can be made to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).

A valid passport is required for travel to the US. Passport cards cannot be used. Ireland has an agreement with the US that allows you to enter on a current passport up to the actual date of expiration – so your Irish passport needs to be valid only for the duration of your stay in the US.

Visitors to Puerto Rico are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on [**social media**](https://linktr.ee/embassyofirelandusa)  to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections.
