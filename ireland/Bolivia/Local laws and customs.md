## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

* Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them.
* Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behavior may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Never buy, use or travel with illegal drugs. There are harsh penalties for those caught trafficking or in possession of illegal drugs, including lengthy prison sentences.

Never leave luggage unattended when departing the country and avoid any contact with illegal drugs, including marihuana. Be aware that small amounts of recreational drugs can result in arrest or jail time. Even trace amounts of drugs on your body, clothing or luggage may lead to a possession charge.
