## Health

Check with a doctor well in advance (8 weeks) of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Bolivia.

### **High Altitudes**

Bolivia's high altitudes pose a risk of altitude sickness, particularly in areas such as La Paz, Uyuni, Oruro, and Potosí. Travelers should be well informed about possible risks about high altitude. Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and evacuation.

### **Zika Virus**

There is a risk of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

### **Dengue Fever**

Bolivia is a risk country for dengue fever transmission. The disease is concentrated in the Departments of Pando and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The other main outbreaks were in the areas of central Cochabamba, the tropical zones of La Paz [Department], and in the city of Riberalta, in the Beni region (northeast Bolivia) and the Tarija Department.

### **Oropuche**

There are outbreaks of Oropouche virus disease (OVD) being reported in Bolivia. While it has been detected in the Americas before, the number of cases is now higher than expected, and cases are being reported in some areas of Brazil, Bolivia, and in Cuba where they haven’t been before.

There are concerns that Oropouche virus can be transmitted from a pregnant person to their unborn baby, with negative pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and possibly congenital microcephaly (impaired head/ brain development).

### **Yellow fever**

A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required by foreigners when entering certain high-risk areas. These areas include all of the regions of Santa Cruz, Pando and Beni, and much of Cochabamba, Tarija and northern La Paz departments. The cities of La Paz and Sucre are risk free.

### **Malaria**

Malaria risk is present throughout the country, except in urban areas and the highlands of La Paz (above 2500m/8202ft) and the two southwestern provinces of Oruro and Potos. Discuss anti-malarial treatment with a doctor before you travel.
