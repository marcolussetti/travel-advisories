## Natural disasters and climate

### **Forest Fires**

Forest fires are affecting some parts of Southern and Eastern Bolivia. This is also having an impact on air quality in the areas most effected by the fires but also in other parts of the country, including La Paz. It is advisable to wear a face mask if the air quality is particularly bad, or to stay inside.

### **Flooding**

Floods and landslides, especially in mountainous areas, are a regular feature of the Bolivian rainy season, which runs from November to March. Roads are frequently impassable for days at a time.
