## Safety and security

### **Social Unrest**

There is a continual risk of demonstrations and strikes throughout the country. Occasional episodes of social unrest can affect main tourist areas, transportation and domestic and international travel without notice.

Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and do not attempt to cross blockades. Blockades can disrupt public transport at very short notice. Strikes may result in widespread road blockades, including on roads to and from airports. Check road status updates from the Bolivian road authority to see which roads are blocked.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Bolivia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime can be an issue in Bolivia and you should take sensible precautions.

Petty crime is common in central La Paz and crowded areas. Thieves normally target unattended or free-hanging bags, pockets and mobile phones, and operate on public transport, stations, crowded streets, and in restaurants and bars.

You should always:

* Keep a close eye on personal possessions;
* Divide your money to avoid taking it all out at once in public;
* Avoid carrying all valuables in one place;
* Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing jewellery;
* Keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe (such as a cloud storage);
* Avoid isolated or poorly lit areas at night;
* Suspect strangers approaching you, including street vendors;
* Avoid packing valuables in checked luggage;
* Avoid leaving valuables, especially passports, in overhead compartments in long-distance buses;
* Lock your room when returning to your hotel or accommodation.

### **Serious Crime**

There is a continuing risk of violent crimes against foreign nationals with reports of European nationals being attacked, robbed, sexually assaulted and threatened with murder. Some foreign tourists have been murdered.

Visitors should remain extremely vigilant and cautious about surroundings whilst travelling around Bolivia, especially on arrival in the country.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Bolivia, be extremely careful. Some of Boliviaâ€™s principal roads are paved, the majority of roads are unpaved rough tracks.

If you want to drive:

* Bring an international driving permit and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Do not drive with windows open, particularly when wearing watches or using a mobile device.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

### **Jeep Tours**

There have been a number of serious road accidents involving jeep tours including during visits to Uyuni and other Salt Flats areas, which have resulted in the deaths of several tourists. We recommend that you only hire reputable tour companies, check the conditions of vehicles, and wear seatbelts at all times. We also encourage drivers to drive safely and to respect speed limits.
