Irish passport holders can enter the Marshall Islands without a visa for a period of 90 days, but must have a confirmed return or onward ticket out of the Marshall Islands.

The Immigration Office can be reached via **email** or via their [**website**](http://www.rmiimmigration.org/)

### **Passport**

Make sure your passport is valid for a minimum of six months after the conclusion of your trip to the Marshall Islands. Passport cards cannot be used.

During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport and your arrival card at all times so you can show evidence of your identity if asked, for example, by the police.
