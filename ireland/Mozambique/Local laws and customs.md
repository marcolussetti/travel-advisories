## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal identification**

Carry original identity documents with you at all times (notarised copies are not acceptable). You may be asked to produce these by the authorities. Always make sure your documents are returned to you.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality in Mozambique is not illegal but social attitudes, particularly outside larger cities, are less tolerant.

Mozambique is a relatively tolerant society where consensual same-sex relations are not criminalised and there is increasing space in public conversation regarding LGBT+ issues. There remains, however, some societal stigmatisation and room for progress in terms of full equal treatment, such as in the registration of LGBT+ groups.

### **Public behaviour**

The use, possession and trafficking of illicit drugs are treated very seriously and punishments can include long jail terms and heavy fines.

Common sense and discretion should be exercised in dress and behaviour. Respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

### **Female travellers**

Abuse against women is relatively common in Mozambique, including practices such as forced marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), sexual assault, and or domestic violence. Please take all necessary precautions to insure your safety.

### **Photography**

There are restrictions on the right to photograph government offices, airports, military establishments, residences and the police or officials.
