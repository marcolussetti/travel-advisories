## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish passport holders travelling to Mozambique for **tourism** or **business** purposes are visa exempt. Travellers must pay the equivalent of 650 Meticais (approx. €10), provide proof of accommodation and (for those travelling by air) a return ticket, to present to the immigration officer at the port of entry. Travellers are advised to keep receipt of this payment for the duration of their stay to present at the port of exit.Travellers availing of the visa exemption can stay for a period of 30 days, with the possibility to extend up to a maximum of 90 days (consecutive or interrupted) in one year.

Travellers are eligible for tourist visas **only if** they do not intend to reside with a citizen or resident of Mozambique during their stay in the country.  Travellers intending to reside with a citizen or resident of Mozambique during their stay in the country should obtain a visitor visa (approx. €50 to be paid on arrival). Pre-approval for visitor visas can be obtained via the [**e-visa platform**](https://evisa.gov.mz/) under the “Border Visa” section.

Passports must be valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Mozambique and have three or more blank pages.

If travelling for non-tourism or non-business purposes, or if staying for a period of over 30 days, Irish nationals require a visa to enter Mozambique. Visas can be obtained from your nearest Embassy or Consulate of Mozambique prior to travel, or via the [**e-visa portal online system**](https://evisa.gov.mz/).

If you overstay your visa, you will be fined for each day you were in Mozambique illegally.
