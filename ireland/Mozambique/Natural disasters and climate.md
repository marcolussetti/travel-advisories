## Natural disasters and climate

The Mozambican climate has a dry season that runs from about April to October, and a rainy season, that runs approximately from late October to April, although there are variations from year to year. We advise you to monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation.

Serious flooding can happen during the rainy season. Pay attention to news reports and weather forecasts.

Coastal regions can be affected by cyclones during the rainy season, with very high winds and major rainfall. Landslides can occur and result in road closures and disruption to travel.

Tropical Cyclone Chido made landfall in Northern Mozambique on 15 December, 2024. In 2023, Tropical Storm Freddy made landfall twice in Mozambique, causing significant damage and loss of life. Three cyclones (Ana, Batserai and Gombe) hit Mozambique in early 2022, causing substantial damage, particularly in the provinces of Nampula and Zambezia.
