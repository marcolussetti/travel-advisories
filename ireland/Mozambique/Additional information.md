## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish passport holders travelling to Mozambique for **tourism** or **business** purposes are visa exempt. Travellers must pay the equivalent of 650 Meticais (approx. €10), provide proof of accommodation and (for those travelling by air) a return ticket, to present to the immigration officer at the port of entry. Travellers are advised to keep receipt of this payment for the duration of their stay to present at the port of exit.Travellers availing of the visa exemption can stay for a period of 30 days, with the possibility to extend up to a maximum of 90 days (consecutive or interrupted) in one year.

Travellers are eligible for tourist visas **only if** they do not intend to reside with a citizen or resident of Mozambique during their stay in the country.  Travellers intending to reside with a citizen or resident of Mozambique during their stay in the country should obtain a visitor visa (approx. €50 to be paid on arrival). Pre-approval for visitor visas can be obtained via the [**e-visa platform**](https://evisa.gov.mz/) under the “Border Visa” section.

Passports must be valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Mozambique and have three or more blank pages.

If travelling for non-tourism or non-business purposes, or if staying for a period of over 30 days, Irish nationals require a visa to enter Mozambique. Visas can be obtained from your nearest Embassy or Consulate of Mozambique prior to travel, or via the [**e-visa portal online system**](https://evisa.gov.mz/).

If you overstay your visa, you will be fined for each day you were in Mozambique illegally.

### **Money**

The currency of Mozambique is the metical (MZN).

You should ensure that you can access money in a variety of ways. Travellers’ cheques are not commonly accepted.

You should ensure that currency exchanges be done at authorised locations. The import or export of local currency is prohibited.

Euro, U.S. dollars and South African rand can be exchanged easily in banks or exchange bureaus. Credit cards are widely accepted in Maputo, but rarely accepted elsewhere.

You should tell your bank before using your card in Mozambique.

### **Health**

You should ensure that you take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.

There are a number of serious health risks in Mozambique and medical facilities outside Maputo are generally poor. In cases of serious illness or injury, medical evacuation to South Africa or elsewhere may be necessary.

Make sure you check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations or other preventative measures (e.g. anti-malarial medication) you need before travelling to Mozambique.

If you have been in a country where yellow fever is endemic, you must have a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mozambique. The World Health Organisation maintains a list of such countries, which are mainly in Africa and Latin America. If you do not hold a valid certificate, the authorities are entitled to insist on vaccination at your own expense before you enter the country.

**Malaria** is endemic throughout the country, including in Maputo. Before travelling, ask your doctor about suitable anti-malarial medication. And after arrival, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

**Cholera** and other diseases caused by unsanitary conditions are common throughout Mozambique, particularly during the rainy season (approximately late October - April). You should drink bottled or boiled and filtered water and eat only where food has been thoroughly cooked and basic hygiene precautions have been taken.

Mozambique has a high **HIV and AIDS**infection rate. You should take appropriate precautions to limit the risk of transmission through blood or sexual contact. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, you should seek immediate medical attention.

Travellers who test positive for **COVID-19** whilst in Mozambique must self-isolate in a hotel or private accommodation. Those who do not have symptoms must self-isolate until advised otherwise by a doctor, after testing negative, or for 7 days. Those showing symptoms must self-isolate for 7 days after developing symptoms.

### **Vaccination certificate**

A yellow fever vaccination certification is required from travellers over 1 year of age arriving from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission and travellers having transited more than 12 hours through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission.

Although Mozambique is not regarded as a yellow fever country, Ethiopia is. Many Irish citizens travelling to Mozambique do so via Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines. It is therefore possible that immigration officials in Mozambique will ask for proof that you have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Failure to have proof of such a vaccination may cause problems at immigration in Mozambique. We recommend for those travelling this route to have made sure to have proof of a yellow fever vaccination.
