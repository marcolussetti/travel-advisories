There has been significant unrest in Mozambique since the elections of 9th of October 2024.The situation has improved in recent months, but the possibility of future unrest remains.

Demonstrations may occur at short notice and cause disruption to services, supply chains, roads, transport, borders and mobile and Wi-Fi networks.

Please pay attention to your surroundings, stay away from crowds, monitor the local media, and follow instructions from the authorities.

Passengers are advised not to travel to the province of Cabo Delgado and certain parts of Nampula in northern Mozambique, due to an ongoing violent insurgency involving armed attacks on local civilians and security forces since October 2017. Please see the ‘Safety and Security Tab’ for further details and information.
