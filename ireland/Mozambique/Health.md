## Health

### **Insurance**

You should ensure that you take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.

### **Medical Facilities**

There are a number of serious health risks in Mozambique and medical facilities outside Maputo are generally poor. In cases of serious illness or injury, medical evacuation to South Africa or elsewhere may be necessary.

### **Vaccinations**

Make sure you check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations or other preventative measures (e.g. anti-malarial medication) you need before travelling to Mozambique.

If you have been in a country where yellow fever is endemic, you must have a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mozambique. The World Health Organisation maintains a list of such countries, which are mainly in Africa and Latin America. If you do not hold a valid certificate, the authorities are entitled to insist on vaccination at your own expense before you enter the country.

### **Malaria**

**Malaria** is endemic throughout the country, including in Maputo. Before travelling, ask your doctor about suitable anti-malarial medication. And after arrival, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Hygiene and Water**

**Cholera** and other diseases caused by unsanitary conditions are common throughout Mozambique, particularly during the rainy season (approximately late October - April). You should drink bottled or boiled and filtered water and eat only where food has been thoroughly cooked and basic hygiene precautions have been taken.

### **HIV and AIDS**

Mozambique has a high **HIV and AIDS** infection rate. You should take appropriate precautions to limit the risk of transmission through blood or sexual contact. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, you should seek immediate medical attention.

### **Covid-19**

Travellers who test positive for **COVID-19** whilst in Mozambique must self-isolate in a hotel or private accommodation. Those who do not have symptoms must self-isolate until advised otherwise by a doctor, after testing negative, or for 7 days. Those showing symptoms must self-isolate for 7 days after developing symptoms.

### **Yellow Fever**

A yellow fever vaccination certification is required from travellers over 1 year of age arriving from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission and travellers having transited more than 12 hours through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission.

Although Mozambique is not regarded as a yellow fever country, Ethiopia is. Many Irish citizens travelling to Mozambique do so via Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines. It is therefore possible that immigration officials in Mozambique will ask for proof that you have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Failure to have proof of such a vaccination may cause problems at immigration in Mozambique. We recommend for those travelling this route to have made sure to have proof of a yellow fever vaccination.
