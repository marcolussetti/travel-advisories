## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Ukraine, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Embassy of Ukraine.

Following the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Russian officials exercising de facto control of the territory are requiring Irish citizens seeking to enter Crimea to have a Russian Federation visa obtained from the nearest Russian Embassy. Those who do not comply with these “visa requirements”, including the expiry date indicated, can be subject to arrest, fines, and/or deportation by those exercising de facto control. It should be noted that the ability of the Embassy to intervene in such cases is extremely limited.

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Ukraine and you should carry your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Money**

The official currency of Ukraine is the Hryvnia (UAH). Euros and US dollars are the easiest currency to exchange in Ukraine, but only use banks and official exchange booths. Depending on the amount to be exchanged, you may need a passport and/or other ID. When you’re exchanging currency, you should get an official receipt, known as an NBU form № 377. Hold on to this receipt because you may need it to exchange Hryvnia to other currencies when you leave the country.

ATMs are available in Ukraine and credit cards are widely used but not universally accepted in cities. Beyond larger urban centres, we advise you to carry enough local currency to meet your needs.

Take particular care when exchanging money to safeguard your passport and credit/ATM cards and don’t lose sight of them during transactions.

### **Transport**

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Crime on public transport**

Be careful on public transport as it is popular with pickpockets and bag snatchers. Take particular care on any overnight trains. We recommend, if possible, travelling with someone else and in a compartment that can be secured from the inside.
