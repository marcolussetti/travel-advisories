## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Ukraine for stays of up to 90 days.

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Ukraine, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Embassy of Ukraine. You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

Following the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Russian officials exercising de facto control of the territory are requiring Irish citizens seeking to enter Crimea to have a Russian Federation visa obtained from the nearest Russian Embassy. Those who do not comply with these “visa requirements”, including the expiry date indicated, can be subject to arrest, fines, and/or deportation by those exercising de facto control. It should be noted that the ability of the Embassy to intervene in such cases is extremely limited.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Ukraine. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Ukraine and you should carry your passport at all times during your stay.
