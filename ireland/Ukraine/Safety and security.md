## Safety and security

In light of developments, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises all Irish citizens currently in Ukraine to shelter in a secure place.

However, citizens should consider leaving Ukraine if they judge it safe to do so, depending on their location and prevailing circumstances.

For Irish Citizens in Ukraine, the Department strongly advises against travel to the following regions: **Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson**.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Crime on Public Transport**

Be careful on public transport as it is popular with pickpockets and bag snatchers. Take particular care on any overnight trains. We recommend, if possible, travelling with someone else and in a compartment that can be secured from the inside.
