## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Always carry your passport as the police often carry out passport checks on foreign nationals. Only original passports are accepted by the police in these circumstances because they are usually trying to establish your status in Ukraine. If you are detained, you should request an official police report.

Police officers must introduce themselves by name, post, rank and tell you the reason they are checking you (ID check). They must also show you a document verifying their identity.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Penalties for drug offences are severe. The sale and distribution of drugs on the street is illegal and these drugs are often hazardous counterfeits.

### **Public Order Offences**

Smoking and drinking alcohol in public places such as public transport, bus stops, underground crossings, playgrounds, parks, cultural and sports venues and government establishments, are officially prohibited.

### **Photography**

You are not allowed to take photographs near government or military establishments.

### **Cultural Artefacts**

There are strict rules governing the export of antiques and items of historical interest. If in doubt, get permission from customs authorities before you attempt to export any item from the country. Failure to comply with local rules may result in fines, confiscation of property or delays in travel.

### **Money**

The official currency of Ukraine is the Hryvnia (UAH). Euros and US dollars are the easiest currency to exchange in Ukraine, but only use banks and official exchange booths. Depending on the amount to be exchanged, you may need a passport and/or other ID. When you’re exchanging currency, you should get an official receipt, known as an NBU form № 377. Hold on to this receipt because you may need it to exchange Hryvnia to other currencies when you leave the country.

ATMs are available in Ukraine and credit cards are widely used but not universally accepted in cities. Beyond larger urban centres, we advise you to carry enough local currency to meet your needs.

Take particular care when exchanging money to safeguard your passport and credit/ATM cards and don’t lose sight of them during transactions.
