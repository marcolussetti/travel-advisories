## Travel to Ukraine overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine together with our EU and other international partners.

The Department strongly advises against all travel to Ukraine, for any purpose. Irish citizens in Ukraine should leave if safe to do so. If you believe you cannot leave safely, you should shelter in a secure place and monitor developments closely. Keep your situation and departure plans under constant review and ensure your travel documents are up to date. Bear in mind that communication lines (phone, internet) may be disrupted.

The Department strongly advises against commissioning surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine. The situation remains extremely dangerous across all of Ukraine, including in Kyiv and western regions, with indiscriminate missile attacks continuing countrywide. Civilian targets including maternity hospitals have been and continue to be hit by missile attacks. In some regions, hospitals and maternity clinics may not be fully operational putting the health of both the surrogate mother and the child at risk.

The Department requires DNA testing to establish parentage before travel documents can be issued for the child. DNA testing must be conducted in Kyiv, witnessed by an official from the Embassy, and results may take in excess of four weeks to be processed, during which time the child will be unable to exit Ukraine.

The capacity of the Department to provide consular assistance in Ukraine remains extremely limited.

Missile and drone attacks on critical civilian infrastructure, in particular since October 2022, have caused significant damage in Ukraine, and resulted in periodic severe water and electricity shortages across many parts of the country. You should be aware that electricity and/or water shortages have been widespread in Kyiv and other cities, and are possible at short notice anywhere in the country.

Irish-Ukrainian dual citizens should be aware that Ukraine does not recognise dual citizenship. If you are a dual citizen male aged between 18 and 60 and enter Ukraine, you may not be permitted to leave due to martial law.

Irish citizens in Ukraine who have not already done so should register their details and those of any dependants [**here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/). Any citizen requiring emergency consular assistance in Ukraine can call the Department on +353 1 408 2000.

Ukraine’s airspace is closed. Most over-land routes out of Ukraine are disrupted, and long delays at border crossings remain a risk. Some routes may face closure at short notice.

Martial law has been declared in Ukraine. Citizens should closely monitor the advice of local authorities and reputable media sources.

**The Department advises all Irish citizens to follow all regulations, including curfews in force in Kyiv or elsewhere in Ukraine. Breaking curfew and moving around the city when there is active conflict ongoing or potential for this to occur without any warning is extremely dangerous.  The authorities have stated clearly that those venturing outside will be regarded as members of sabotage groups.**

The International Organization for Migration has set up information and support hotlines for persons seeking to leave Ukraine. Anyone in Ukraine can call 527 (free from mobile phones), 0800505501 (free from landline phones) and information on calling from neighbouring countries is [**available here**](https://www.iom.int/iom-hotlines-persons-fleeing-ukraine).

To date, a significant number of people from Ukraine arriving in Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive are seeking State-provided accommodation.  The State is now providing accommodation for nearly 100,000 people seeking international protection, the majority Ukrainians, compared to 7,500 this time last year. This very large increase has resulted in a severe shortage of accommodation.  Projections in terms of accommodation availability remain extremely challenging.  Those thinking about travelling to Ireland are advised to be fully aware of these difficult circumstances in which not every person arriving in Ireland looking for State-provided accommodation may be able to secure that accommodation upon initial arrival in Ireland.
