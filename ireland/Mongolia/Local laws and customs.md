## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal. Taking photos of the police, the army or soldiers or related infrastructure is prohibited and is considered a criminal offence.

### **Dual nationality**

Mongolia doesn't recognise dual nationality and this may limit our ability to provide consular assistance to Irish/Mongolian dual nationals who are arrested or detained.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what type or quantity of the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.
