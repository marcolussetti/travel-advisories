## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens can travel to Mongolia for tourism for stays of up to 30 days without obtaining a visa. This visa-free arrangement, for tourism, is effective until 31 December 2025.

Irish citizens travelling to Mongolia for purposes other than tourism (such as work, study, long-term stay, or other personal purposes) should obtain the appropriate visa to enter Mongolia. You should take steps to apply for a visa well in advance of your planned visit. Information on how to apply for a visa can be obtained from the [**Embassy of Mongolia in London**](https://en.embassyofmongolia.co.uk/).

Further information on visa requirements is available on the website of the [**Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia**](https://en.consul.mn/visa/c/82)  and on the [**website of the Immigration Agency of Mongolia**](https://immigration.gov.mn/en/).

### Passport

Irish citizens must have a valid passport to enter Mongolia, with a validity date at least six months beyond the end of their intended period of stay. It's also advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you, and to store a photo of the personal identification and Mongolian visa pages of your passport on your phone.

You are legally required to carry your passport at all times when travelling in Mongolia and, if living in Mongolia, your residency card. We also recommend that you leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Registration**

Accommodation providers such as hotels are required to register foreign nationals staying at their property. This is usually done online by the hotel or other accommodation provider through the Immigration Agency of Mongolia’s website.
