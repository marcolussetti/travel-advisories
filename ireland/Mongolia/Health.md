## Health

### Vaccinations

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if they recommend any vaccinations or precautions for travel to Mongolia.

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical facilities in Mongolia don't meet most Western standards. Medical services are limited, especially for emergency healthcare. Serious injury or illness typically requires medical evacuation.

If youâ€™re travelling to remote areas, keep in mind that there is no helicopter evacuation service in Mongolia. Access to emergency medical care involves long road journeys to the nearest large town for transfer to the capital.

Given the lack of quality medical care and emergency response in Mongolia, particular caution is advised when undertaking sporting activities.

Medical facilities in Mongolia typically require payment up front. Make sure that you have comprehensive medical insurance which covers private healthcare, medical evacuation and repatriation. Bring basic medical supplies with you, including any regular prescription drugs you may need.

### **Water**

Use only bottled water for drinking. Be aware that food safety standards in restaurants may not be adequate.

### **Air Pollution**

Air quality in Mongolia is frequently hazardous during the winter months. If you are sensitive to or at risk of health impacts from air pollution, you should plan accordingly.
