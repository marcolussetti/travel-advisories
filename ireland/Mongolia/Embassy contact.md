## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Mongolia, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in China.

Irish Citizens seeking emergency consular assistance outside office hours (including weekends and holidays) should contact the Embassy duty phone on +86 13801056774.

Monday to Friday 09:00-12:30 and 13:30-17.00.
