## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Violent crime can take place in Mongolia even in daylight and on busy streets. Foreigners are the target of theft and assaults, especially in crowded areas such as markets and places popular with tourists. The threat is also elevated during festive periods. Always take sensible precautions:

* Carry valuables discreetly. Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes and on public transport.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don't use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after using an ATM.
* Don't carry your credit card and money together. Leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and avoid remote or outlying areas after dark. Arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Ensure that you use licensed taxis at all times.

### **Local travel**

Mongolia is a vast, sparsely populated country – 22 times the size of Ireland with a population less than 4 million. Trips outside of the capital should be carefully planned and preferably undertaken with a reputable local guide or travel agency.

When visiting remote areas, bring supplies, clothing appropriate for the climate, and make contingency plans. Consider bringing a satellite phone, as mobile networks and GPS do not always function adequately in remote areas.

The road infrastructure in Mongolia is underdeveloped, with only about 10% of the road network paved. Even in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, the extent of paved streets is limited. Street lighting and signage are also limited. Roads in remote areas may not be easily discernible, sometimes being only tracks left by other vehicles. The standard of driving is poor.

### **Driving**

Road conditions, the standard of driving and frequency of accidents mean driving in Mongolia is not advised.

If you plan to drive to Mongolia, an international driving permit is required. You should also bring both your full driver's licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance. Due to the long distances between service and filling stations, and the harsh climate, trips to rural areas should be undertaken with at least two vehicles in case of breakdown.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

Self-drive rental cars are not routinely available. If you're hiring a vehicle, we advise against handing over your passport as a form of security: you’re legally required to carry your passport with you at all times. If you're allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
