## Natural disasters and climate

In the event of a natural disaster or extreme weather, we recommend that you follow the advice of local authorities. Monitor media reports for the latest information.

### **Climate**

Mongolia is subject to extreme temperatures from -35°C in the winter to +35°C in the summer. The climate varies considerably, including mountain, steppe, and desert climates. The Mongolian winter extends up to eight months between October and May.

The variation in climate and weather should be kept in mind when planning trips outside the capital, given the long distances between settlements.

### **Earthquake**

Mongolia is located in an active seismic zone. Most earthquakes are centred in the mountainous west of the country and there is a high risk in the capital Ulaanbaatar. If you're travelling to or living in Mongolia, make sure you note the contact details of the Irish Embassy in Beijing, China, for use in the event of an emergency. Follow the Embassy in Beijing on X@[**IrlEmbChina**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbChina/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Flooding**

There is a short rainy season from mid-July to mid-September.

### **Dust Storms**

Dust storms occur between May and June.
