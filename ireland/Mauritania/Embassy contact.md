## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Mauritania, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Rabat, Morocco**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/morocco/rabat/)**.**

Please note that if emergency assistance is required while the Embassy is closed, contact the duty number, +212666 933 599.
