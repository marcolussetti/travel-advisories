## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens should apply before travel for an online [**e-visa**](https://anrpts.gov.mr/visa/requestvisa) through the website of the Mauritanian National Agency for the Population Register and Secure Titles (Agence Nationale du Registre des Populations et des Titres Sécurisés), who can be contacted via email (contact@anrpts.gov.mr) if you encounter any technical difficulties with your application.

You should apply for an e-visa well in advance of your travel date to ensure that it is issued on time by the Mauritanian authorities.

E-visa fees must be paid on arrival in Mauritania in Euros or US Dollars. For information on visa lengths and fees, read guidance on the [**Mauritanian government’s website**](https://www.diplomatie.gov.mr/fr/node/50). Change and receipts are not issued

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Mauritania. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Mauritania and to carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Mauritania there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

Contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise on the fees which apply.
