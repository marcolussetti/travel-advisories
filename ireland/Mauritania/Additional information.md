## Additional information

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Mauritania and to carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Mauritania there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

Contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise on the fees which apply.
