## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Malta. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register their presence with [**Identity Malta**](https://www.identitymalta.com/)**,** the government agency with responsibility for residency status.

### **Passport**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Malta.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.
