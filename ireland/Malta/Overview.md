### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Malta.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Malta. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register their presence with [**Identity Malta**](https://www.identitymalta.com/)**,** the government agency with responsibility for residency status.

Visitors to Malta are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Valetta  on social media (X [**@IrishEmbMalta**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbMalta) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandinmalta/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Malta by dialling 112. Further emergency contact numbers can be found [**here**](https://www.visitmalta.com/en/a/useful-numbers/). You can file a remote police report [**here**](https://pulizija.gov.mt/en/).
