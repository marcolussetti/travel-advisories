## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Malta is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime is low in Malta but pickpocketing, handbag snatching and theft are becoming more common in the main tourist areas. Opportunistic crime does take place particularly in areas where large groups socialise in the evenings so make sure you take sensible precautions.

### **Reporting a crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Malta, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you want to drive in Malta, bring your full Irish driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance. Keep to the speed limit. In Malta traffic drives on the left hand side of the road as in Ireland.

Road improvement projects and construction work are currently widespread and can cause significant delays and travel disruption. It is also worth bearing in mind that some roads in Malta are in poor condition, and that local standards of driving can be poor. In addition, pedestrians should take particular care especially in urban areas. In 2018, Malta experienced an average of 3.8 deaths per million inhabitants compared to the Irish average of 3.1 road deaths per million inhabitants (source: [**European Commission**](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/scoreboard/compare/people/road-fatalities_en#2017)).

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
