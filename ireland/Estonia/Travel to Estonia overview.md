#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Tallinn for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Estonia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Estonia. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are required to register your residence with local authorities.

Visitors to Estonia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of local developments by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Tallinn on social media (X [**@IrishEmbTallinn**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbTallinn) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/people/Embassy-of-Ireland-Estonia/100069043845585/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
