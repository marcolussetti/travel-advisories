### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Estonia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Estonia. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are required to register your residence with local authorities.

Visitors to Estonia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of local developments by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Tallinn on social media (X [**@IrishEmbTallinn**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbTallinn) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/people/Embassy-of-Ireland-Estonia/100069043845585/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Estonia by dialling 112.
