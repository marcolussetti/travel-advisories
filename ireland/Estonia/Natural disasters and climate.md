## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Estonia is very cold in winter and generally under snow until March. If planning to visit, you should bring warm winter clothing as well as appropriate footwear.

In the winter months, footpaths in cities and towns, including the Old Town in Tallinn, are extremely dangerous because of impacted ice.
