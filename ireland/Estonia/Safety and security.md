## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Estonia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Estonia but you sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Pickpocketing and mugging can be a problem in the Tallinn Old Town, ferry ports and major hotels - particularly during the summer months so be careful - take sensible precautions and avoid unlit side-streets and parks at night.
* Be aware that, while generally safe, incidents involving “date rape” drugs (such as GHB, Rohypnol etc.) have been reported, particularly in tourist hotspots. Take care when consuming alcohol. Do not leave drinks unattended, and do not accept drinks from strangers.

### **Reporting Crime**

If victim of a crime while in Estonia, report it to the local police immediately. To call the police, dial 112. You can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Tallinn if you need help.

**Entry into Estonia from the Territory of the Russian Federation**

* The Estonian government has advised that Border Crossing Points with the Russian Federation may be closed at short notice. Please consult the website of [**Estonia’s Police and Border Guard**](https://www.politsei.ee/en) (Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet) for up-to-date information on border crossing points.
* Please note that there are restrictions on vehicles with Russian licence plates in Estonia. See the [**Estonian Ministry of the Interior for more information**](https://www.siseministeerium.ee/en/news/estonia-prohibits-entry-russian-motor-vehicles).
* The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to the Russian Federation until further notice. If you must travel, ensure that you consult the travel advice and information from the Embassy of Ireland Russia.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Estonia please take extra care, particularly when driving after dark and on major highways as road traffic accidents are common. If driving:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law (the legal alcohol limit is zero) and there is a risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Dimmed headlights and seatbelts are mandatory at all times.
* All vehicles must have winter tyres from 1 December to 1 March every year. These dates may change if there are severe weather conditions so check local conditions if driving between October and April.
* If you intend to travel by car or motorbike to Estonia, you must bring your original Vehicle Registration Certificate, as your vehicle will be refused entry into Estonia if you can not produce it. You are also obliged to carry a copy of your insurance certificate within the vehicle.

### **Pedestrians and Cyclists**

When moving on the road in poor visibility or at night-time, a pedestrian must use a reflector or a light source. Wearing a reflector is mandatory in Estonia. For more information, please refer to Estonia’s citizens’ information [**website**](https://www.eesti.ee/eraisik/en/artikkel/traffic/traffic-management/pedestrian).

### **Vehicle Hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
