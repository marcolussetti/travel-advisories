## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in French Guiana, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Paris**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/france/paris/)**.**

Please note that if you require urgent assistance while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy number, 0033(0) 1 44 17 67 00, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox.

This mailbox will be monitored regularly.

Monday to Friday 09:30am - 12:00pm
