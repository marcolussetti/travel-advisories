### **Travel and Medical Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. These costs will be covered by an appropriate travel insurance policy bought before departure, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly recommends that you obtain travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for travel to French Guiana.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
