## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Entry requirements for Irish citizens traveling to French Guiana are the same as for travel to France. There is no need to obtain a visa (short stay or long stay) and the Irish passport must be valid up to the return date. No extra validity is required.

### **Health**

* Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling (8 weeks) to see if you need any vaccinations for travel to French Guiana.
* Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends that you obtain travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.
