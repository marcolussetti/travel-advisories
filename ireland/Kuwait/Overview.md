Please note that in Kuwait defaulting on the repayment of loans or the non-settlement of bills is taken extremely seriously. A criminal case is often filed resulting in a travel ban. Individuals in such circumstances are not permitted to leave Kuwait. Ensure that any personal debt is fully paid before you leave Kuwait. Failure to do so may impact your ability to transit through Kuwait in the future.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Please note that if you misplace your passport while in Kuwait, there is a very good chance it will be handed into lost and found or the police.
