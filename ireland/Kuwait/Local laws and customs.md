## Local laws and customs

### **Muslim Culture**

Kuwait is an Islamic country and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

Dress conservatively, particularly in the Emirates of Sharjah and Ajman, where Islamic law is more rigorously enforced. Women should cover shoulders and knees and underwear should not be visible. Swimming attire should only be worn on beaches or at swimming pools.

Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and there have been several arrests for kissing in public. Sex outside of marriage is illegal, as is cohabitation, adultery and homosexual behaviour. If you conduct a sexual relationship outside heterosexual marriage you run the risk of prosecution, imprisonment and/or a fine and deportation. Private life is respected in Kuwait, however, people are punished for sexual activity outside marriage where there is a public element or if it is brought to the attention of the police authorities.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Alcohol**

Alcohol is illegal in Kuwait. Drunken behaviour in public or driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, and/or deportation as well as the withdrawal of your driving licence.

### **Illegal Drugs**

There is zero tolerance for drug-related offences.

The penalties for drug trafficking, smuggling and possession of illegal drugs (including residual amounts) are severe. Drug trafficking penalties can include the death sentence or life imprisonment.

### **Forbidden Products**

Bringing drugs, pork products, and pornographic books and materials into Kuwait is forbidden. Videos, books and magazines are subject to scrutiny and may be censored.
