## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Kuwait is a Muslim state and Islamic customs are strictly observed. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively - women who wear shorts or tight-fitting clothes, in particular in downtown areas, are likely to attract unwelcome attention. Be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Drunken behaviour in public or driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a fine or imprisonment and/or deportation and the withdrawal of your driving licence.

### **Sexual behaviour**

Homosexual behaviour is illegal. Any public display of affection between men and women is also illegal. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Forbidden products**

The import and use of narcotics, alcohol, pork products and obscene material are forbidden and can lead to imprisonment.

### **Business/commercial activities**

Anyone involved in a commercial or any other dispute with a Kuwaiti company or individual may be prevented from leaving the country or placed in custody, pending resolution of the dispute. Bouncing cheques is illegal in Kuwait and can result in imprisonment and/or a fine.Â  The law does not provide for offenders to be released from custody on bail. 'Post dated' cheques can be banked immediately.

### **Co-habiting**

Co-habiting in Kuwait is illegal. If living with your partner in the same house, you need to be married.
