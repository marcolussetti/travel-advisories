## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

There have been a number of protests by expatriate labourers in Kuwait over their employment conditions. International events and political developments (including elections) may also prompt demonstrations in Kuwait.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

If in the vicinity of a protest, leave the area immediately and do not take photographs.

### **Terrorism**

Most visits to Kuwait are trouble-free. However, be aware of the threat from terrorism generally in the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and against Western interests, as they have been elsewhere in the region.

### **Landmines**

Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. When travelling outside Kuwait City, keep to tarmac roads. Be careful when using beaches and picnic spots. Even where officially cleared, there is still a danger from unexploded ordnance.  Do not pick up any strange metal, plastic or other objects lying around.  Do not souvenir hunt for war memorabilia.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Kuwait but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways.
* Do not walk alone at night. If female, do not travel alone.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.

Violent crime against foreigners is rare. However, take care if intending to travel in conservative areas like Jahra, where there have been incidents involving firearms, and Jleeb Al Shuyoukh where there have been riots by migrant workers protesting about their conditions.

### **Taxis**

We advise against hailing a taxi from the road in Kuwait, particularly if female. There have been a few incidents of passengers being harassed while doing so. We recommend booking a taxi in advance by telephone from a known and reputable taxi company.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Kuwait, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi**](/en/uae/abudhabi/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Kuwait, be extremely careful. Driving can be hazardous because many drivers exceed speed limits and switch lanes without warning. They frequently ignore traffic lights and speak on their mobile phones while driving with scant attention to other road users. Constant vigilance is essential. If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights

### **Crossing the border**

Only use authorised road border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Any other unauthorised movement in the vicinity of borders is illegal and dangerous: armed guards patrol the border area. If planning to cross the border from Kuwait into Iraq, make sure that you have the correct paperwork.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
