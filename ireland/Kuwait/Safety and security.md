## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

There are ongoing regional tensions and, in the event of any incidents, you should monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities. The domestic political situation in Kuwait is generally stable.

### **Social Unrest**

There have been a number of protests by expatriate labourers in Kuwait over their employment conditions. International events and political developments (including elections) may also prompt demonstrations in Kuwait.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

If you find yourself in the vicinity of a protest, leave the area immediately and do not take photographs.

### **Terrorism**

Visitors should be aware that there is a threat from terrorism generally in the region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, and against Western interests.

### **Landmines**

Landmines and other hazardous ordnance are still present in Kuwait. When travelling outside Kuwait City, keep to tarmac roads. Be careful when using beaches and picnic spots. Even where officially cleared, there is still a danger from unexploded ordnance. Do not pick up any strange metal, plastic or other objects lying around. Do not souvenir hunt for war memorabilia.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Kuwait but take sensible precautions. If you are a victim of a crime while in Kuwait, report it to the police immediately. You can also contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/) if you need further assistance.

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare but do happen. Kuwaiti law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual. If the sexual relations are determined to have been consensual, both parties may face prosecution for the offence of sex outside marriage. Drink spiking can occur. Do not accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.

### **Taxis**

Avoid hailing a taxi from the road in Kuwait, particularly if you’re female. There have been a few incidents of passengers being harassed while doing so. We recommend booking a taxi in advance by telephone from a known and reputable taxi company.

### **Social Media and Photography**

Kuwait has strict laws regarding online behaviour, including comments made via social media, with offences punishable by fines, imprisonment and deportation. Sharing videos or photographs of others through social media can be a punishable offence.

Visitors should stay away from military sites – taking photos of military or security installations, and some public buildings is prohibited. Avoid filming or photographing people without their permission.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Kuwait, exercise caution. Road safety standards are low, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by speeding, poor driving, and inadequate lighting.

Drivers involved in an accident causing injuries may be detained until the injured are released from hospital. In an accident causing injuries or fatalities, those found at fault may be legally required to provide financial compensation to the injured or the family of the deceased.

Visitors should exercise great care as a pedestrian and only cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings. It is illegal to cross in other places. Take care when crossing, as drivers sometimes fail to stop for pedestrians at zebra crossings.

Offensive gestures and bad language can lead to fines, a jail sentence, and/or deportation.

Excursions to the desert can be dangerous, especially without adequately equipped 4 x 4 vehicles. Serious accidents can occur when driving on sand dunes in the desert, which can result in death. You should always travel in convoy with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone and leave travel plans with friends or relatives.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and the penalties can be severe. Your insurance is likely to be invalidated, leaving you to pay claims by other parties involved.
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Water Safety**

Rip currents can occur at any beach and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea. Always comply with warning signs and only swim at approved beaches. Only swim at pools with a lifeguard in attendance, and always check and ensure that there are qualified lifeguards present if children are swimming as part of their school activities or at summer camps.

The safety of tourist boats may not be up to Irish standards. Ensure that life jackets are available for all passengers.

### **Crossing the Border**

Only use authorised road border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Any other unauthorised movement in the vicinity of borders is illegal and dangerous: armed guards patrol the border area. If planning to cross the border from Kuwait into Iraq, make sure that you have the correct paperwork.
