## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Kuwait, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uae/abudhabi/).

If you require emergency assistance at the weekend or on a public holiday, you will be asked to leave a message on the answering machine. The answering machine is monitored regularly, and the Duty Officer at the Embassy will contact you as soon as possible. When you leave a message, remember to state your name, the nature of the problem, where you are now, and the details of how the Duty Officer can contact you (e.g. leave your mobile phone number or the phone number of the hotel/hostel where you are staying). If necessary, contact the police. Please note that the Duty Officer will deal with emergencies only.

The Embassyâ€™s opening hours are as follows:

Monday - Thursday 09:00-13:00 Friday 09:00-11:00
