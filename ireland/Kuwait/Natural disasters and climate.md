## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Kuwait has an arid desert climate characterised by extremely hot summers, with temperatures often exceeding 45Â°C, and mild winters. Rainfall is scarce and sporadic while humidity levels can be high, especially in coastal areas.

### **Sandstorms**

There are occasional sandstorms but although they may restrict visibility, they are not usually severe enough to affect daily life.
