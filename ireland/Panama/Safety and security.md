## Safety and security

### **Border Security**

The Panama-Colombia border (Darien Gap) is particularly dangerous. There have been reports of violent crime, kidnapping and murder in this area.

Crime is also an issue in the Mosquito Gulf, where criminal organisations, such as dissent groups and drug traffickers, may be present.

These areas are particularly dangerous due to their remoteness.

### **Crime**

Street crime is a problem in areas like Panama City, Colon, and Chiriqui province. Such crimes can include shootings, home invasions, armed robberies, pick-pocketing, muggings, and thefts. In Panama City, areas such as San Miguelito, El Chorillo, Rio Abajo, 24 de Diciembre, Santa Ana and Juan Diaz are known to have greater levels of crime as most of these crimes are between members of rival gangs.

Personal attacks, including sexual assault, can occur in tourist destinations across Panama.

Always take precautions to protect oneself and personal belongings against the risk of crime. Where possible, travellers should plan how they will travel to and from their destination. Public transportation should be used with caution. There is a risk of pickpocketing on buses, at bus stations and in busy areas.

People have been targeted after withdrawing cash from ATMs. Use ATMs located inside banks or shopping centres.

Take care of your personal belongings and avoid obvious displays of wealth. Do not carry large sums of cash or valuables in public.

Avoid using mobile phones on the street.

### **Lost or Stolen passports:**

Take extreme care with passports and other personal documentation. If a passport is lost or stolen, it can take up to three weeks to get a replacement, due to time and distance factors. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if travellers are able to provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies or scans of passports.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of crime while in Panama, report it to the local police immediately or dial 911 from any telephone. Many insurance companies will only compensate loss from theft if travellers can provide a police report.

### **Political Situation**

Political demonstrations may occur at short notice, which can lead to road blocks and occasionally turn violent. Travellers should avoid protests and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **Driving**

Exercise caution if you are planning to drive in Panama. Travellers can use an Irish driver’s license for a period of up to 90 days.  If you want to drive:

* Ensure driving licenses are valid for use in Panama and ensure adequate and appropriate insurance is purchased
* Keep all vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching when stopped in traffic

### **Taxis**

Where possible, plan how you will travel to and from your destination and only use pre-booked taxis. We strongly advise against hailing taxis from the street. In general, taxis in Panama do not use meters, so it is advisable to agree on a fare before getting into the taxi.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over passports as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in your sight at all times.

Check that adequate insurance is purchased and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Safe Swimming**

Be careful when swimming or taking part in water sports on Pacific and Caribbean beaches as in some places there are strong currents, rips and undertows. Panamanian beaches may not have lifeguards on duty.

Swimming in the Bay of Panama is not recommended as it is thought to be polluted with untreated sewage and industrial waste**.**

If travellers wish to go swimming, always check the signage before getting into the water. Avoid swimming in water where there are no other swimmers.

### **Natural Disasters and Climate**

Earthquakes can occur from time to time in Panama. Tsunamis can also happen. Make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake or tsunami.

Panama is prone to heavy rains. The rainy season runs from April to December, but October and November normally register the heaviest rainfall. Occasional flooding and landslides occur in rural areas. Some city streets and rural roads can become impassable due to flooding.

In Panama, the hurricane season is from June to November, but storms can happen year-round. They can cause flooding and landslides, particularly in rural areas.
