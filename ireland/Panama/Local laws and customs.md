## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to travellers and it is their responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as traveller behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Drug trafficking is a very serious crime in Panama and drug smugglers face severe penalties, usually receiving long terms of imprisonment.

Merely being in the company of someone who is using drugs is grounds for arrest.

Travellers should pack their luggage themselves and keep it with them at all times. Don't carry anything through customs for anybody else.

### **LGBTI Travelers**

Homosexuality is legal but may not be widely accepted in some parts of the country, especially in rural areas.

### **Taking Photos**

It's illegal to take photos of official buildings. Ask for permission before photographing anyone.
