## Additional information

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens don't need a visa to visit Panama for periods of up to 90 days. When entering the country, you may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel.

Passports should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Panama and contain at least one unused page. Entry requirements change from time to time, so check these requirements before departure with the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Panama.**](https://mire.gob.pa/ministerio/embajadasyconsulados/)

It is advisable for travellers to take a number of photocopies of their passport with them. During their stay travellers should carry a photocopy of their passport, the passport page containing their Panamanian visa (if applicable), and the passport page containing their entry stamp, at all times.

### **Arriving by sea**

Those arriving in Panama by private boat are advised to contact Panama’s [**Servicio Nacional de Migración**](https://www.migracion.gob.pa/) for information on entry permits and associated fees and conditions.
