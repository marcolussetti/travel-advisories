## Embassy contact

The Embassy operates an out of hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance on weekends and public holidays. If travellers are in need of emergency assistance during these times, you should leave a message on the emergency message system by calling +57 1 657 6060. The emergency message system is checked regularly outside of office hours and a member of the Embassy staff will contact you as soon as possible.

Citizens leaving a message must remember to state their full name, the nature of the problem, where you are now, and the details of how the Duty Officer can get in contact (e.g. personal mobile phone number, or the phone number of the hotel/hostel where staying).

Alternatively, travellers may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin at +353 (0)1 408 2000.

Monday to Friday 09:30-13:30
