## Additional information

### **Entry requirements - (visa/passport)**

You need a valid passport to visit Portugal. You can enter Portugal up to the date of expiry.

A significant number of citizens have had their passport seized on arrival in Portugal as they were travelling on a passport that had at one stage been reported lost or stolen. Please make sure that the passport you are travelling on has never been reported as lost or stolen, as this will produce an alert on the Schengen Information System and your passport may be seized by the Portuguese Immigration Authorities on arrival.

### **Minors travelling from Ireland**

In Portugal, unaccompanied minors (travelling alone or with an adult who is not their legal guardian) are sometimes requested for letters of permission when they arrive at immigration in Portugal. The Embassy cannot advise you on this. You should contact the Embassy of Portugal in Dublin before you travel. They can advise on what documents you may need.

### **Buying property**

**If you intend to buy property in Portugal, we strongly advise you to consult an independent legal advisor from the beginning of the process.**
