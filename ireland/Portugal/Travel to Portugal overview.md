### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Portugal.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Portugal.

Irish passport holders, as EU citizens, will not be affected by the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) or the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). These systems refer to the travel of non-EU citizens. General information on the introduction of the EES and the ETIAS can be found on the [**European Union website**](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/index_en).

Visitors to Portugal are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Under Portuguese law, you must carry identification at all times.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@IrishEmbLisbon**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbLisbon) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### Emergency Assistance

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact all emergency services in Portugal by dialling **112**.
