#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Lisbon for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

There is no change to entry requirements for Portuguese passport holders travelling directly to Ireland without transiting through the UK

#### **Wildfires**

Wildfires are common in Portugal, particularly during the summer. You should familiarise yourself with [**wildfire safety advice**](https://www.ipma.pt/en/riscoincendio/rcm.pt/) and always follow the safety instructions of the local authorities.

For more information, please see the Safety and Security tab.

### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Portugal.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Portugal.

Irish passport holders, as EU citizens, will not be affected by the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) or the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). These systems refer to the travel of non-EU citizens. General information on the introduction of the EES and the ETIAS can be found on the [**European Union website**](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/index_en).

Visitors to Portugal are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Under Portuguese law, you must carry identification at all times.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@IrishEmbLisbon**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbLisbon) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### Emergency Assistance

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact all emergency services in Portugal by dialling **112**.
