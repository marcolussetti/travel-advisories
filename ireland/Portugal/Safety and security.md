## Safety and security

### **Wildfires**

Wildfires are a feature of summer in Portugal. Most fires are quickly brought under control but some can escalate into major events, particular when the weather is very hot and windy. Take particular care to avoid starting a fire, and take standard fire safety precautions, keeping away from fires.

If you are near a wildfire, call the emergency number 112. Further safety advice about wildfires is available in English [**here**](https://aldeiasseguras.pt/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Aldeia-Segura-Triptico-ENG.pdf?fbclid=IwAR304_iMX_2dMJ05zV9_Zf2ei_5gxW0qED_rEAhPR7YfkLn2kC-IOr_T4aA).

The best place to get the most current information on fires is via this link to the Portuguese Civil Protection service [**http://www.prociv.pt/en-us/Pages/default.aspx**](http://www.prociv.pt/en-us/Pages/default.aspx). Under "active events", fires appear as a flame icon. Red icons indicate ongoing fires not under control, orange relates to fires burning but under control and green to resolved events.

### **Terrorism**

Along with other European countries, there is potential for Portugal to experience international terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

* Crimes such as pickpocketing, handbag snatching and theft from cars are increasing in main tourist areas including Lisbon and the Algarve.
* Pay close attention to your personal belongings at tourist attractions, on public transport (especially on the popular E15 and E28 trams in Lisbon) and at busy rail and underground stations, museums, restaurants and hotel foyers. There have also been reports of thefts from safe boxes ­in apartments and hotels.
* Don't carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don't carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Leave your car doors locked and the windows rolled up, both when you park and when driving through urban centres at night
* On hikes in remote areas, including pilgrimage walks, we advise that women should not travel alone. Attacks, although rare, are not unknown.

### Nightclubs

* In general Portugal is a safe country, however, be careful of your personal safety as there have been reports of incidents in nightclubs.

### **Reporting a crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Portugal, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy if you need help.

The [**Portuguese Association for Victim Support (APAV)**](http://apav.pt/apav_v2/index.php/en/) is a non-profit organisation with qualified personnel that informs, protects and supports victims of crime with a personalised and confidential service (also available in English). APAV Helpline: 7007202277.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Portugal, be aware that driving regulations and customs are different from those in Ireland. Traffic is faster and the accident rate is much higher. Cars drive on the right side of the road so traffic will be coming from the opposite direction to traffic in Ireland.

If you want to drive:

* Be aware of Portugal’s traffic laws, such as speed limits. Fines have recently be increased considerably for several offences
* Never allow children under 12 to travel in the front passenger seat
* Carry a high-visibility vest and a hazard warning triangle in your vehicle
* Portugal operates a toll system on its motorways and you risk heavy fines if you don’t or can’t pay toll fees. Don’t use the green lanes at the tolls – they’re reserved for motorists who subscribe to the automatic pay system (Via Verde)

### **Pedestrians**

Whether you’re a driver or a pedestrian, be careful at crossings on busy roads, as designated crossing places are often poorly marked. Pay particular attention late at night or in busy commercial and entertainment districts in cities such as Lisbon and Porto.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
