Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Iraq at this time due to the extremely dangerous security situation in all parts of the country and the high threat of terrorist attacks.

Citizens who consider their presence in Iraq to be absolutely essential, should have adequate and continuous professional security arrangements in place and ensure they are regularly reviewed.

We advise Irish citizens who remain in Iraq [**to register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in Jordan if they have not already done so.

Irish citizens who consider their presence in Iraq to be **absolutely essential** will require a visa to enter Iraq, and visas can now be obtained online via the [Republic of Iraq Ministry of the Interior website.](https://eservice.evisa.iq) A valid passport is required for travel to Iraq. Passport cards cannot be used.

Irish citizens in Iraq are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the  Irish Embassy in Jordan on social media (X[**@irlembjordan**](https://twitter.com/irlembjordan) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irlembjordan)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**
