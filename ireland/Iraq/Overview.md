## Overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Iraq at this time due to the extremely dangerous security situation in all parts of the country and the very high threat of terrorist attacks.

Irish citizens who are currently in Iraq are advised to leave immediately.

Citizens who consider their presence in Iraq to be absolutely essential, should have adequate and continuous professional security arrangements in place and ensure they are regularly reviewed.

We advise Irish citizens who remain in Iraq [**to register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in Jordan if they have not already done so.

Irish citizens who consider their presence in Iraq to be absolutely essential will require a visa to enter Iraq. European citizens can obtain visas upon arrival at Iraqi points of entry. A valid passport is required for travel to Iraq. Passport cards cannot be used.

Irish citizens in Iraq are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the  Irish Embassy in Jordan on social media (Twitter[**@irlembjordan**](https://twitter.com/irlembjordan) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irlembjordan)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

There is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Iraq, which limits our capacity to respond. However, where emergency consular assistance is required for Irish citizens, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Jordan**](/en/jordan/).

The Embassy can be contacted at the following number: +962 6 590 3200. For out of hours emergencies only, contact +962 799732370.
