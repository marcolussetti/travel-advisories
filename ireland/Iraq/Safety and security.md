## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

The security situation in Iraq is extremely dangerous and there is a very high threat of terrorist attacks.

### **Terrorism**

Terrorists and anti-government forces have carried out numerous attacks against places frequented by foreigners, such as hotels and restaurants. There have been attacks on international organisations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN and non-government organisations (NGOs).

### **Kidnapping**

The threat of kidnap of foreign nationals across Iraq remains very high. People have been kidnapped at their homes, work and in transit. Kidnappers donâ€™t discriminate between nationalities or religions. Those kidnapped include individuals who had security arrangements in place and some of those kidnapped have been killed.
