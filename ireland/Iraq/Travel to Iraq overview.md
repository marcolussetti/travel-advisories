## Travel to Iraq overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to Iraq at this time due to the extremely dangerous security situation and high threat of terrorist attacks.

In light of the prevailing regional security situation with respect to neighbouring Iran, Irish citizens already in Iraq can expect severe disruption to air travel due to the closure of airspaces at short notice and the cancellation of flights to and from the region. Citizens with existing travel plans are strongly encouraged to contact their airlines directly.

Irish citizens are encouraged to remain vigilant, and to closely follow any safety protocols issued by Iraqi, regional and local authorities. We advise Irish citizens who remain in Iraq [**to register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their presence on the Citizens Registration if they have not already done so. Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Jordan on social media (X[**@irlembjordan**](https://twitter.com/irlembjordan) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irlembjordan)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

Citizens who consider their presence in Iraq to be absolutely essential should have adequate and continuous professional security arrangements in place and ensure they are regularly reviewed.
