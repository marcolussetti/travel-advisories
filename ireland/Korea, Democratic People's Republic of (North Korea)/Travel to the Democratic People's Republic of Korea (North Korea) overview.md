In recent years, the number of missile tests carried out by North Korea have increased significantly, underscoring the underlying unpredictability of the situation. The Embassy in Seoul is monitoring the situation and advises Irish citizens in Korea to be aware of and closely follow developments. They also recommend that all travellers [**register with the Embassy**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/).

The political leadership in North Korea is the object of intense, organised reverence and lack of courtesy or perceived insults to, or jokes about, the North Korean political system and its leadership may be treated severely. If you travel to North Korea, avoid taking photographs of soldiers and officials or guarded buildings. Reserved behaviour in public is the norm.
