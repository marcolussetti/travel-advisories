## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Law enforcement**

Be aware that serious crimes committed in Eritrea may attract corporal punishment and the death penalty.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual acts are illegal and we advise caution and discretion at all times.

### **Money**

The currency in Eritrea is the Nakfa (ERN) which is not convertible outside Eritrea. Excess Nakfa should be converted to hard currency at one of the ‘Himbol’ exchanges in town, there are limits on what you can exchange at the ‘Himbol’ branch at the airport. The Nakfa is currently pegged to the US dollar at the rate of 15 Nakfa to 1 US dollar. Remember to retain currency transaction receipts as you may be required to produce these when leaving Eritrea.

The economy in Eritrea is cash-based and there are no ATMs. There are also no credit card facilities, and all payments must be made in cash. Hotels in Eritrea will require you to settle your bill in US dollars. It is also illegal to use foreign currency to make any purchases with the exception of a limited number of officially-recognised hotels. Ensure that you get and retain a receipt for any such purchases.

You are not permitted to take any more than 500 Nakfa out of Eritrea. When leaving Eritrea if you hold more than 500 Nakfa it will be confiscated and for amounts in excess of 5,000 Nakfa you could be liable to prosecution which could lead to heavy fines and may also delay your departure from the country.

Taking photographs of government buildings and military installations is not allowed.
