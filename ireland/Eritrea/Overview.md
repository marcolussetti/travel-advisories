### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against non-essential travel to Eritrea at this time.

In addition, we advise against all travel within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders.

All foreign nationals, including diplomats are required to apply in advance for a travel permit to leave the Asmara region.

If you decide to travel to Eritrea, be aware that the authorities there haven’t always informed the relevant Embassy when foreign nationals need consular assistance.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Eritrea.

A valid passport is required for travel to Eritrea. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Eritrea are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Irish citizens are advised to exercise extreme caution, stay away from military sites, airports and government buildings wherever possible and follow the instructions of the authorities.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media ([**Twitter@ IrlEmbKenya**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbKenya)) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassyinkenya/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
