## Entry Requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Eritrea. If unsure about the entry requirements for Eritrea, including visa and other immigration information, visitors are advised to ask their travel agent or contact the country’s nearest Embassy or Consulate.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Eritrea. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Eritrea and visitors should carry a photocopy of their passport at all times during their stay.

### Lost or stolen Passports

If a passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.

We’ll do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Eritrea there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

You should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Kenya**](/en/kenya/nairobi/) to find out what is needed to apply for a passport.
