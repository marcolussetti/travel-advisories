## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Tonga are relatively low however petty crime is common and incidents of robberies, violent assaults and sexual assaults do occur. Security risks increase after dark, avoid travelling alone at night or to isolated areas.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Tonga:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Same-sex activity between men is criminalised, although the law is rarely enforced.

### **Road travel**

Driving in Tonga can be dangerous, especially at night due to poor street lighting and poorly-maintained roads. Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.

### **Nature and Climate**

### **Earthquakes and volcanoes**

Tonga is located in a seismically active zone, which can lead to earthquakes and volcanic activity. Parts of Tonga were severely impacted by and recovering from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and tsunami which flooded parts of Tongatapu and other nearby islands in January 2022. Monitor media for the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### **Tropical storms and Cyclones**

In Tonga, strong winds are expected from the beginning of November to the end of April, some of which can reach cyclone strength. During this time, intense rainfall and subsequent floods and landslides are to be expected. However, tropical storms and cyclones can happen throughout the year.

You are advised to monitor local and international weather updates from the [**World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)**](http://severe.worldweather.org/),  or [**Tonga Meteorologial Services – Ministry of MEIDECC**](https://met.gov.to/)  the [**Fiji Meteorological Service website**](http://www.met.gov.fj/).

### **Swimming**

Take local advice before swimming. Strong rips can occur where there's a break in the reef. Fatal accidents have occurred. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic eruption and tsunami has led to debris in the sand and water. Take extra care when swimming.
