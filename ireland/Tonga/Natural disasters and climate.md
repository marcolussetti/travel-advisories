## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes and Volcanoes**

Tonga is located in a seismically active zone, which can lead to earthquakes and volcanic activity. Parts of Tonga were severely impacted by and recovering from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and tsunami which flooded parts of Tongatapu and other nearby islands in January 2022. Monitor media for the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### **Tropical Storms and Cyclones**

In Tonga, strong winds are expected from the beginning of November to the end of April, some of which can reach cyclone strength. During this time, intense rainfall and subsequent floods and landslides are to be expected. However, tropical storms and cyclones can happen throughout the year.
