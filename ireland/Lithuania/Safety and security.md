## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Lithuania is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime targeting tourists remains relatively low in Lithuania but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don't carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don't carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* While Lithuanian cities are generally safe, some petty crime such as pick-pocketing or bag-snatching is possible. Avoid poorly-lit streets, parks, and secluded areas after dark.
* Be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
* We recommend you check the price of drinks before ordering and whether there is a 'cover' charge made for entry to bars, restaurants and other establishments. You should be vigilant when using your credit/debit card.

### **Reporting crime**

If you're a victim of a crime while in Lithuania, report it to the local police immediately. Police can be contacted via the national emergency telephone number, 112.

### **Driving**

If you want to drive:

* Bring your driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Drive on the right-hand side of the road
* Winter tyres are a legal requirement in Lithuania between 10 November and 1 April
* Dipped headlights are compulsory all year round

Right hand drive vehicles can be driven in Lithuania temporarily - while on holiday, for example, for up to 90 days per year.  However, if you're moving to Lithuania on a long-term basis please note that right-hand drive vehicles cannot normally be registered in Lithuania.

### **Car documentation**

Border officials and police require original car documents and if you’re driving into the country, you need car insurance valid for Lithuania.

When travelling by car, border officials will ask you for the following documents:

* A passport with a validity of at least 6 months
* Original car registration documents (copies are not acceptable)
* International vehicle insurance (Green Card)

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
