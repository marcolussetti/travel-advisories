## Natural disasters and climate

### **Storms**

Warm, humid weather gives rise to frequent storms throughout the year, some of which cause damage to buildings, trees, etc. You should be careful during stormy weather, and avoid unnecessary travel.

### **Forest Fires**

Over 30% of Lithuania is covered with forests. Forest fires are rare, but can occur in periods of dry weather. We advise you to avoid areas that may have fire warnings in place.
