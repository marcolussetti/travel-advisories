## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens don’t need a visa to enter Lithuania. However, entry requirements may change from time to time and you should check with the nearest Lithuanian Embassy before you travel. Lithuania is a member of the [**Schengen Area**](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/).

### **Passport**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Lithuania.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

If you intend to live in Lithuania for longer than three months, the Lithuanian authorities will require that any child travelling and living with you will need to have his or her own passport. You may experience difficulties upon your arrival or departure in the case of children who are listed on the passport of one of their parents.
