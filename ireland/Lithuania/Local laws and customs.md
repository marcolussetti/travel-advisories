## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Public drunkenness (i.e. in the streets, on public transport, etc.) will be dealt with very severely by the Lithuanian authorities, who have the right to detain people in detoxification centres if they believe them to be very drunk. It is illegal to supply alcohol to anyone under 20 years of age in Lithuania.
