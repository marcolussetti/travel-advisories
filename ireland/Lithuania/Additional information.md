## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens don’t need a visa to enter Lithuania. However, entry requirements may change from time to time and you should check with the nearest Lithuanian Embassy before you travel. Lithuania is a member of the [**Schengen Area**](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/).

### **Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

If you intend to live in Lithuania for longer than three months, the Lithuanian authorities will require that any child travelling and living with you will need to have his or her own passport. You may experience difficulties upon your arrival or departure in the case of children who are listed on the passport of one of their parents.

### **Storms**

Warm, humid weather gives rise to frequent storms throughout the year, some of which cause damage to buildings, trees, etc. You should be careful during stormy weather, and avoid unnecessary travel.

### **Forest fires**

Over 30% of Lithuania is covered with forests. Forest fires are rare, but can occur in periods of dry weather. We advise you to avoid areas that may have fire warnings in place.
