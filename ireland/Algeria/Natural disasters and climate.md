## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Algeria has a Mediterranean climate along the coast, with mild, wet winters, and hot, dry summers. The Sahara desert experiences extremely high summer temperatures, though it’s a bit cooler between November and April. Although daytime temperatures rarely fall below 25°C, desert nights can be cold even in the height of summer.

### **Flooding**

Despite the lack of rain in the Sahara, other parts of Algeria are susceptible to severe flood damage.

### **Earthquake**

Northern Algeria is within an earthquake zone. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake. In May 2003, a severe earthquake struck the Algiers area and over 2,200 people were killed and more than 10,000 were injured.
