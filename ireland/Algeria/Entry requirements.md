## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens must apply for a visa to visit Algeria. Visas must be obtained prior to travel from an [**Algerian embassy**](http://embassyofalgeria.ie/) or consulate.

### Passport

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Algeria.

Although you’re not required to carry your passport at all times, you should have it with you on longer journeys within Algeria. You will need it if you’re travelling internally by air.

In general, keep your passport somewhere safe and carry a copy with you at all times.
