## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens must apply for a visa to visit Algeria. Visas must be obtained prior to travel from an [**Algerian embassy**](http://embassyofalgeria.ie/) or consulate.

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Algeria.

Although you’re not required to carry your passport at all times, you should have it with you on longer journeys within Algeria. You will need it if you’re travelling internally by air.

In general, keep your passport somewhere safe and carry a copy with you at all times.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Algeria.

### **Money**

ATM machines are not as widespread as in Europe and credit card use is mostly confined to hotels and some businesses in the larger cities. Algerian Dinars should be obtained from bureaux de change at the international airports and larger hotels or from banks in the main cities. Street money vendors should be avoided. Algerian Dinars cannot be exported.
