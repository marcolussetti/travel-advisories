### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against non-essential travel to desert and border regions due to the threat of terrorist attacks. A high degree of caution should be taken in other areas, including the coastal cities. Please refer to the Safety and Security section for more detailed information.

Algeria’s air, sea and land borders are partially open. The major airports are in Algiers (Houari Boumediene airport), Oran (Ahmed Ben Bella airport), and Constantine (Mohamed Boudiaf airport). Please note that the border with Morocco is closed.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Algeria. Visas must be obtained prior to travel from an [**Algerian embassy**](http://embassyofalgeria.ie/) or consulate.

A valid passport is required for travel to Algeria. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from date of entry into Algeria. For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Algeria are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.
