## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

* Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them
* Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Algeria does produce some wine and beer, which is served in some bars, hotels, restaurants and night clubs in the bigger cities. However, alcohol isn’t served everywhere and it isn’t served anywhere during Ramadan.

### **Muslim culture**

When travelling in Algeria, take care not to offend local culture or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals. Be conscious of your dress and behaviour if you intend to visit places of worship.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. Guide books, local hoteliers and tour guides can be good sources of information for how to behave and dress respectfully.

### **Local culture**

In Algeria the weekend is Friday and Saturday.

### **Female travellers**

Female travellers can face particular issues around security and dealing with the religious and cultural beliefs of the countries they visit (especially if they’re travelling alone). We advise you to do some research before you travel, so you know what to expect from the country you’re visiting.

Some quick tips include:

* Always take basic personal safety precautions, such as not walking alone at night or in quiet areas.
* Don’t leave your food or drink unattended.
* Keep details of your travel plans and where you’re staying to yourself.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal in Algeria. Sexual acts between people of the same sex are punishable by imprisonment and homophobic attacks can take place. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Don’t attempt to take photos of any government building or security installation. This includes police and police checkpoints
