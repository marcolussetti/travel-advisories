## Safety and security

### **Practical advice**

* Get advice locally about areas of risk and security concerns
* Take common-sense precautions about safety and security
* Know who to contact in case of an emergency

### **Crime**

The crime rate is low, however, petty crime, such as pickpocketing, may occur.

Be vigilant about your personal security, and ensure that your belongings, including your passport and important documents, are secure at all times.

Tourist facilities are limited and so are the number of commercial flights to and from Nauru. Travellers are advised to plan ahead of time and do their research prior to their travel to Nauru to minimise safety risks.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Nauru, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Canberra**](/en/australia/canberra/) if you need help.

### **Water sports**

Safety standards of tour operators in Nauru may not compare to Irish standards, especially for adventure sports, including diving. Check the operator’s credentials and safety equipment beforehand and make sure your travel insurance policy covers your planned activities.  Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

### **Public transportation**

There are no taxis or public transportation. You can rent a vehicle from local rental companies.
