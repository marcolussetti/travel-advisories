## Health

### **COVID-19**

**3-G rule:**

* For the protection of vulnerable groups, the 3-G rule (vaccinated/recovered or tested) continues to apply in health care settings (e.g. visits to hospitals and nursing homes) within Austria. To meet the 3-G rule, a certificate or proof of Covid vaccination, recovery or testing must be presented upon request. Please pay attention to their different validity periods.
* **To note:** A previous recovery is no longer considered an ‘immunological event’ in its own right. This means that going forward, three vaccinations will generally be required to fulfil the above stated 3-G rule. Each recovery is still valid for six months; however, it no longer replaces a vaccination.

### **Tick-borne encephalitis**

If planning to travel in forested areas, there is a risk of being exposed to tick-borne encephalitis. Ticks are very common in country areas and are active from spring to autumn. Vaccinations can be organised with a medical practitioner.

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) purchasing a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency expenses**

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. skiing, water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)**

Irish Citizens are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay. Ensure to get or renew your [**EHIC**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/) (formerly E111) before travel, and remember, one is needed for every person travelling.

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so check with the hospital administrator beforehand.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for the entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication, or in case you are asked to justify why you have certain medications at an entry point (airport, port, land border etc.).

Bear in mind that not all over-the-counter medications available in Ireland are legal in other countries, research this before travel. Check with the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the country you are planning to visit if unsure which medications are legal.
