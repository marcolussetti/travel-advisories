### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter [**Austria**](https://www.austria.info/en) and are advised to carry photo identification at all times when travelling within Austria. The Embassy recommends carrying a photocopy of your passport at all times.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Austria. However, if **staying for longer than three months** you **must register** with the local migration authority within four months of arrival in Austria. A ‘registration certificate’ will be issued upon request, if the requirements are met. In this case (when taking up or leaving accommodation in Austria), visitors will also need to [**register/deregister**](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/dokumente_und_recht/an__abmeldung_des_wohnsitzes.html) **separately with the authorities in accordance with the Austrian Registration Act (Meldegesetz)**.

The responsible migration authority depends on one’s [**main residence**](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/lexicon/H/Seite.990076.html). This can be:

* the Governor’s Office or,
* the [**Municipal Executive or administrative district’s office**](https://www.help.gv.at/linkaufloesung/applikation-flow?leistung=LA-HP-RL-Fremdenpolizei_EWR&quelle=HELP&flow=LO),German text
