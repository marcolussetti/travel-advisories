## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

Under Austrian law, identification, such as a passport must be carried, at all times, or be able to produce identification within a short timeframe. We advise to carry photocopies of the relevant pages of your passport, and keep the original in a safe place.

If staying in private accommodation in Austria for more than three days, your place of residence must be registered with the local authorities.
