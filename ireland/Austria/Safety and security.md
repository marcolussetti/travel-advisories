## Safety and security

A security alert of a suspected attack was issued by authorities on 15 March 2023. People are asked to remain vigilant in crowded and popular inner city places.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Austria but visitors should take sensible precautions.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

Be particularly aware of petty theft at Vienna´s largest train stations, Westbahnhof, and Hauptbahnhof. There have also been several recent reports of thefts on the trains between Vienna and Prague/Budapest.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Austria, report it to the local police immediately. Citizens can contact the Embassy if assistance is required.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen, contact the Embassy as soon as possible and report the loss or theft to the nearest police station or Magistrat. Citizens will need to submit a copy of your police statement when applying for a new passport or making a claim on your insurance.

In some cases, you may be able to use this statement instead of a passport, but check with the airline before going to the airport. If the airline will not accept the statement, the Embassy may issue an Emergency Travel Certificate, valid for one journey from Austria to Ireland, or a Temporary Passport, valid for a restricted period of time.

### **Walking and Cycling**

Please observe traffic lights when walking in Austrian towns and cities, particularly Vienna. On the spot fines are administered for crossing the road at a red light.

It is important to observe the rules of the road when cycling. On the spot fines are administered for cycling in pedestrian areas. It addition, cyclists in Vienna are subject to random breath testing. Failing a test may result in a fine, imprisonment, or both.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road are more complex in Austria than those in Ireland, especially for caravan and motor home owners so if planning on driving, remember:

* Bring a full Irish driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Using headlights is mandatory in poor visibility and recommended at all other times.
* Carry a high-visibility vest and a hazard warning triangle in the car.
* Motorists in Austria must form an emergency corridor as soon as traffic ceases to progress and congestion is imminent on motorways or dual carriageways and highways, regardless of whether emergency vehicles are already in the vicinity or not.
* Road conditions are generally good although roads in alpine areas can become hazardous during winter and some mountain roads may be closed for extended period.

### **Using the Motorway**

If planning to use motorways and ‘S’ roads in Austria, you risk heavy, on-the-spot fines if not displaying a [**Motorway Vignette**](http://www.austria.info/uk/service-facts/getting-there-around/austria-by-road) on the vehicle. Motorway Vignettes can be purchased at all major border crossings into Austria and at larger petrol stations.

### **Drink Driving**

The legal drink driving limit in Austria is 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The limit is 10 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood for coach/HGV drivers and those who have had a licence for less than two years. Penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol are severe.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
