## Natural disasters and climate

### **Practical Advice**

If travelling to Austria, make sure to know what to expect – then plan and pack appropriately. Get local advice on how to manage in the case of a serious incident or dangerous conditions and co-operate with local authorities.

### **Climate**

Austria’s climate is moderate and generally pleasant, with warm summers and cold winters (temperatures largely depend on altitudes). From June to September, visitors can expect sunshine and low rainfall and from November to March the weather is much colder and usually ideal for winter sports.

### **Skiing**

If planning a skiing holiday contact the [**Austrian Tourist Agency**](http://www.austria.info/uk) which covers Ireland (1890 930 118 or **holiday@austria.info**) for advice on weather and safety conditions before you travel. Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. Follow all safety instructions carefully, given the danger of avalanches in some areas, in particular in times of heavy snow.

Always check with the local tourist offices on current snow and weather conditions on arrival. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim. Avalanche information can be obtained by telephoning +43 512 581839 or by visiting the following websites of the Tirol Avalanche Warning Service or the European Avalanche Warning Service. Take extra care during the spring season, as this is when avalanches most commonly occur.

Please register with the Embassy if embarking on a ski holiday.
