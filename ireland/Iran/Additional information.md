## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Please note that visiting Iran may impact your ability to enter other countries subsequently. You should factor this into any plans you make to visit Iran.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport. During your stay you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

If your passport contains evidence of travel to Israel, such as an Israeli stamp or stamps from other countries’ border crossing points with Israel, entry to Iran may be refused.

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Iran. Medical facilities are reasonable in the major cities of Iran but poor in remote areas.

It is recommended that you have adequate health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation if required.

### **Communications**

Depending on your service provider, it may not be possible to use mobile roaming in Iran. Check with your provider before you travel.

Communications can be difficult with low internet speed, frequent interruptions of SMS networks and sporadic severing of the mobile phone network.

Be aware that using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted, especially if it contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on criminal charges including espionage.

### **Money**

You can not use international bank cards (debit or credit) in Iran. Usually it is not possible to change travellers’ cheques. You should therefore bring enough hard currency (Euro or US dollars) with you to fund your stay.

Due to international sanctions, banks may stop transactions that they suspect are associated with Iran and take action against customers who they believe are making payments to Iran-based entities. This could result in you losing access to banking services.
