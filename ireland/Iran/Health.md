## Health

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens. The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens who are already in the country.**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Iran. Medical facilities are reasonable in the major cities of Iran but poor in remote areas.

It is recommended that you have adequate health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation if required.
