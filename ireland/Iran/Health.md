## Health

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Iran. Medical facilities are reasonable in the major cities of Iran but poor in remote areas.

It is recommended that you have adequate health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation if required.
