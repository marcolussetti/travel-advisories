## Travel to Iran overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens.**

The security situation in Iran remains volatile and could deteriorate quickly.

Extensive restrictions remain in place on Iranian airspace. Flight cancellations and disruption could continue for some time, with little or no notice. For further information on flight options, you should contact airlines directly.

If you wish to leave Iran, and can do so safely, it is also currently possible to do so via a land border to a neighbouring country. Entry to neighbouring countries is not straightforward and you should inform yourself of any visa or paperwork requirements, including for dual nationals. Borders may close at short notice.

If you are not in a position to leave, we advise you to remain vigilant, monitor developments and media, as well as any advice from the authorities to shelter in place.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is very limited in its ability to assist Irish citizens to leave Iran.

Irish citizens in Iran should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

**If you are an Irish citizen and require urgent assistance in the case of an emergency, please call +353 (0)1 4082527, or in case of an emergency out-of-hours, on +353 (0)1 4082000.**

**Please be aware that we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency.**

**Irish citizens should ensure their personal documents, including passports, are up-to-date.**

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran at this time due to the security situation in the region, as well as** the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention of European citizens by the Iranian authorities.

Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid any protests or large gatherings.

There are ongoing security issues within Iran. The security situation is particularly dangerous in the provinces bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Security incidents can occur in any part of the country.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are an Irish citizen with Iranian nationality, or a dual Irish citizen who enters Iran on a non-Irish passport, our ability to provide consular assistance to you will be very limited.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Iran are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
