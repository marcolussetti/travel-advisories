## Travel to Iran overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens due to the security situation in Iran and the wider region and the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention in Iran. The Department will be very limited in its ability to assist Irish citizens to leave Iran during a crisis situation.**

In recent days, protests have been taking place in cities across Iran. There are reports of violence and fatalities at these protests, as well as reports that participants have been detained by the Iranian authorities. Any Irish citizens who may be in Iran are strongly advised to avoid large public gatherings, demonstrations and protests and follow the advice of local authorities.

Furthermore, following the conflict between Israel and Iran in June 2025, the security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate quickly. Any such deterioration may cause extensive flight and other travel disruptions, making leaving the country at short notice very challenging. Iran has closed its airspace due to regional unrest several times in the past year; leaving the country via land or sea borders in the event of airspace closure is likely to be very challenging.

In addition, foreign travellers including Irish citizens in Iran are at risk of arbitrary detention by the Iranian authorities, including on charges of espionage. There has been an increase in the number of detentions of foreign nationals recently.

If you are an Irish citizen in Iran, we advise you to consider your presence in the country carefully. Citizens should ensure their personal documents, and those of their family members, including passports and visas, are up-to-date.

Irish citizens in Iran should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran at this time due to the security situation in the region, as well as the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention of European citizens by the Iranian authorities.**

Irish citizens in Iran are strongly advised to avoid any protests or large gatherings, and to avoid taking photographs, recording videos or flying drones (the latter is illegal in Iran).

There are ongoing security issues within Iran. The security situation is particularly dangerous in the provinces bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. However security incidents can occur in any part of the country.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are an Irish citizen with Iranian nationality, or a dual Irish citizen who enters Iran on a non-Irish passport, our ability to provide consular assistance to you will be very limited.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Iran are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
