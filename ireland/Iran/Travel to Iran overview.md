## Travel to Iran overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Do not travel to Iran.**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens due to the security situation in Iran.**

**If you are an Irish citizen currently in Iran, we would encourage you to leave immediately while commercial options remain available. It should be noted that airlines may suspend flights or adjust their schedules to and from Iran at short notice at this time. The best information on flights will be available directly from your airline.**

**Large protests have been taking place in cities across Iran. There are reports of violence and fatalities at these protests, as well as reports that participants have been detained by the Iranian authorities. We are also aware of significant disruptions to phone (including SMS) and internet communications, along with airspace closures and flight cancellations. Avoid public gatherings, demonstrations and protests, and follow the advice of local authorities.**

**The Department will be very limited in its ability to assist Irish citizens in Iran during a crisis situation.**

Furthermore, following the conflict between Israel and Iran in June 2025, the **regional** security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate quickly.

In addition, foreign travellers - including Irish citizens - in Iran are at risk of arbitrary detention by the Iranian authorities, including on charges of espionage. There has been an increase in the number of detentions of foreign nationals recently.

If citizens remain in Iran against the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, they should ensure their personal documents, and those of their family members - including passports and visas - are up-to-date.

Irish citizens in Iran should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

If you are an Irish citizen in Iran and require urgent assistance in the case of an emergency, please send a WhatsApp or SMS to +98 910 810 5733, or an email to **tehranpublicmail@dfa.ie**, detailing the nature of the emergency and your personal details. If internet or SMS is not working, please call the above number. Please note that communications are severely disrupted in Iran at present.

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

A duty officer will respond as soon as possible. Phone lines and email are monitored 24/7.

Please be aware that we are very limited in the help we can offer in an emergency.

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran at this time due to the security situation in the region, as well as the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention of European citizens by the Iranian authorities.**

Irish citizens in Iran are strongly advised to avoid any protests or large gatherings, and to avoid taking photographs, recording videos or flying drones (the latter is illegal in Iran).

There are ongoing security issues within Iran. The security situation is particularly dangerous in the provinces bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. However, security incidents can occur in any part of the country.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are an Irish citizen with Iranian nationality, or a dual Irish citizen who enters Iran on a non-Irish passport, our ability to provide consular assistance to you will be very limited.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Iran are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
