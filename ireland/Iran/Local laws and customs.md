## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Advice for all Visitors**

People travelling on tourist visas should strictly adhere to the conditions of their visas. Tourists should not engage in any other activities such as voluntary work, research or internships. It is a criminal offence to do so and may lead to prosecution or detention. Tourists should bear in mind that Iranian security forces may be suspicious of foreign nationals, particularly independent travellers or students. Any behaviour that does not have an obvious explanation can put you at risk, no matter how innocent it may seem. This may include travel off the beaten track, being present near crowds or sensitive sites, taking photographs (except in major tourist sites) and having contact with Iranians who are of interest to the authorities.

### Drugs and Alcohol

Drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines, long prison terms, and the death penalty.

Alcohol is illegal in Iran. Alcoholic drinks in Iran are unregulated and mostly homemade. Methanol poisoning occurs from time to time, resulting in serious injuries and death.

### **Illegal Products**

It is illegal to import pork or pork products into Iran.

It is illegal to use drones in Iran without authorisation.

You will need permission from the Iranian authorities to bring in a range of electronic equipment, including: satellite phones; GPS trackers; and walkie-talkies.

### Dress and Behaviour

Iran is an Islamic Republic and Islamic practices and beliefs are closely adhered to in the country's customs, laws, and regulations. Common sense and discretion should be exercised in dress and behaviour. You may be approached by members of the security services if they deem your clothing not to be in compliance with local law.

Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. Visitors are therefore advised to dress conservatively. Men should not wear shorts or sleeveless shirts; women are obliged to cover their head with a scarf (hijab), wear long trousers and sleeves and to conceal the body’s contours by wearing a loose-fitting knee-length outer garment.

There are additional dress requirements at certain religious sites. Women may be asked to put on a chador (a garment that covers the whole body except the face), before entering.

### **Law Enforcement**

Irish citizens are subject to Iranian law when in Iran, which differs in many areas to Irish law.

There are restrictive laws governing modesty and sexuality in Iran. Sex outside of marriage and adultery are illegal and subject to severe penalties, including the death penalty.

Same-sex relations for both men and women are illegal in Iran and subject to punishments including corporal punishment, prison sentences and the death penalty.

### **Photography**

Photography or the flying of drones near military, government installations and many other areas are strictly prohibited. Any transgression may result in detention and serious criminal charges. Be aware that sensitive government buildings and facilities may be hard to identify so take extreme care when taking photographs in any areas that are anything other than very obvious tourist attractions.

### **Social Media**

Many common websites and social media services are not accessible from within Iran. Travellers should exercise discretion in the content and views that they post to social media when travelling in Iran.

### **Communications**

Depending on your service provider, it may not be possible to use mobile roaming in Iran. Check with your provider before you travel.

Communications can be difficult with low internet speed, frequent interruptions of SMS networks and sporadic severing of the mobile phone network.

Be aware that using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted, especially if it contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on criminal charges including espionage.

### **Money**

You can not use international bank cards (debit or credit) in Iran. Usually it is not possible to change travellers’ cheques. You should therefore bring enough hard currency (Euro or US dollars) with you to fund your stay.

Due to international sanctions, banks may stop transactions that they suspect are associated with Iran and take action against customers who they believe are making payments to Iran-based entities. This could result in you losing access to banking services.
