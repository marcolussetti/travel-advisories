## Safety and security

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens. The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens who are already in the country.**

### **Unrest**

Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid any street gatherings or demonstrations while in Iran and to avoid taking photographs, showing an interest in demonstrations, or flying drones, as such behaviour can result in arrest and detention by the security forces. We recommend you exercise caution and monitor local media reporting for up to date advice on security risks.

### **Terrorism**

There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, and there have been a number of terrorist attacks in Iran in recent years.

Terrorist attacks are, by their nature, random and indiscriminate and cannot be predicted in advance. Visitors are advised to exercise a high degree of caution, particularly in public places that are frequented by large crowds. Local contacts such as hotel staff or tour organisers are also good sources of information.

### **Crime**

Travellers have occasionally been victims of theft while in Iran so take sensible precautions to protect yourself from crime:

* Do not carry travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as busy streets, train and bus stations.
* There have been attempted robberies by people claiming to be plain-clothes policemen. If approached by anyone who claims to be a policeman, ask to see their ID and request the presence of a uniformed officer. Do not hand over any documents or cash, or get in to any vehicle.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Iran, report it to the local police immediately. You can also contact the Embassy of Ireland in Tehran using the emergency contact details below.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Iran, be extremely careful. The standard of driving, particularly in urban centres, is poor and can be challenging to newcomers. Iran has one of the highest rates of road accidents in the world and travellers should drive with great care.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driverâ€™s licence and an international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights

### **If Involved in an Incident**

Do not leave the scene. Wait until the police arrive to make their report.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise **not** to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
