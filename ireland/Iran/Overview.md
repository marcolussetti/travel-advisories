## Overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens.**

Due to the ongoing military strikes in Iran, if you are currently in Iran, you are advised to be vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities, including any orders to shelter in place.

Iranian airspace is currently closed, with no flights departing the country. The security situation could deteriorate further with little warning. If you have the means to leave the country safely by road you could consider doing so, however there may be security challenges associated with doing so, and borders could close at short notice.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is very limited in its ability to assist Irish citizens to leave Iran.

Irish citizens in Iran should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

**Irish citizens who are in need of Consular Assistance can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Iran via SMS or Whatsapp message on +98 910 810 5733 or by calling the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin on +353 1 408 8000.**

**Irish citizens should ensure their personal documents, including passports, are up-to-date.**

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to strongly advise against all travel to Iran at this time due to the ongoing conflict, as well as** the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention of European citizens by the Iranian authorities.

Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid any protests or large gatherings.

There are ongoing security issues within Iran. The security situation is particularly dangerous in the provinces bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Security incidents can occur in any part of the country.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are an Irish citizen with Iranian nationality, or a dual Irish citizen who enters Iran on a non-Irish passport, our ability to provide consular assistance to you will be very limited.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Iran are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
