## Overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all travel to Iran for Irish citizens. We advise Irish citizens who remain in Iran to leave while commercial options remain available.** The security situation could deteriorate further with little warning. Air travel may be suspended indefinitely at short notice. The Department of Foreign Affairs will be very limited in its ability to assist Irish citizens to leave Iran; citizens should not rely on evacuation options being possible if commercial options become unavailable. Irish citizens should ensure their personal documents, including passports, are up-to-date.

Irish citizens who choose to remain in Iran should register with the Department via the [**Citizens Registration**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) facility if they have not already done so.

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Iran at this time** due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detentions of European citizens by the Iranian authorities.

Irish citizens in Iran should note that protests, sometimes violent, are currently occurring in a number of locations across the country. Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid these protests. Please note that Internet access is frequently restricted or shut down completely by the authorities, which impedes communication.

There are ongoing regional tensions. There's an increased risk of military conflict involving air and missile strikes against targets in Iran. This could escalate rapidly and without notice and could result in prolonged disruption or cancellation of flights in and out of the country.

There are ongoing security issues within Iran. The security situation is particularly dangerous in the provinces bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Security incidents can occur in any part of the country.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Iran.

A valid passport is required for travel to Iran. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months’ validity after the date of exit from the country. Passport cards cannot be used.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you are an Irish citizen with Iranian nationality, or a dual Irish citizen who enters Iran on a non-Irish passport, our ability to provide consular assistance to you will be very limited.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Iran are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the [Department of Foreign Affairs on X](https://x.com/dfatravelwise?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
