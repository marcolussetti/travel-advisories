## Safety and security

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local regulations, customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Crime**

Crime remains low in Slovenia but visitors should take sensible precautions.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Slovenia, report it to the local police immediately and get a report. The telephone number for the Police is 113 and the general emergency number is 112. Please contact us at the Irish Embassy in Ljubljana if help is required.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in Slovenia are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained. Roads are generally not lit outside urban areas so please take extra care when driving at night.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware of Slovenia’s traffic laws, such as speed limits.
* The rider and passenger on a motorcycle or motorised bicycle must both wear strapped homologised crash helmets and it is against the law to carry children under 12 on a motorcycle.
* Heavy on-the-spot fines are in place for traffic offences such as speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and for using mobile telephones without a hands-free device. There are also fines for jay walking.
* You must drive with dipped headlights at all times, even during the day.

### **E-tolls in Slovenia: Obligation to Pay E-toll at Border with Heavy Fines for Non-compliance**

Slovenia has an e-toll/vignette system for motorway travel with sales points at border crossings. All vehicles under 3.5 tonnes, including cars, must have a vignette to drive on motorways even if only transiting through Slovenia for short distances/periods. Slovenian officials/police closely monitor motorway use and drivers who do not have a vignette will receive an on-the-spot fine of up to €800. You can find information about prices and locations of where to buy the vignettes on the [**Motorway Company of the Republic of Slovenia (DARS) website.**](http://www.dars.si/Dokumenti/Dokumenti/Toll/Vignette_308.aspx)

Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes must use the electronic tolling system for heavy vehicles. Under this system, only those vehicles registered with the DarsGo system, equipped with a DarsGo Unit and with valid financial coverage for electronic toll payments will be able to use Slovenian motorways and expressways.

### **Warning: Breakdowns on Slovenian Motorways/Expressways**

DARS (Slovenia’s motorway/expressway operator) warns that there have been reports of unofficial/unlicensed tow-truck operators who prey on broken-down vehicles and charge excessive prices for their services. If you break down on a Slovenian motorway/expressway DARS advise phoning their official number +386 1 518 8 518 to arrange a tow and DARS also advises drivers to double check that any tow operator who arrives is the one ordered. More information on what to do if you breakdown, including the official towing price list, is available on the DARS website [**DARS Towing Service**](https://www.dars.si/Towing_service)

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged). If hiring a car in another country, you must tell the hire company that you are planning to travel to Slovenia in order to get proper cover.

### **Alcohol**

It is illegal for professional drivers (class C, D and E) to drive with any alcohol in their system. The blood/alcohol limit is 0.05 for all drivers of private vehicles and motorcycles.

Anyone suspected of driving or attempting to operate a vehicle when under the influence of alcohol or drugs must submit to a breath test or a medical examination. Drivers who refuse to submit to a breath test are presumed to have been driving while intoxicated.

### **Winter Equipment**

From mid-November to mid-March and during winter weather conditions outside of these dates, vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must be fitted with winter tyres. Under certain conditions, snow chains will suffice. You can find out more on the [**Automobile Association of Slovenia website**](https://www.amzs.si/en).

### **Hiking**

Slovenia is a popular hiking destination for tourists, and every year the [**Mountain Rescue Service of Slovenia**](https://www.grzs.si/o-grzs/predstavitev/) is called upon to rescue foreign visitors in distress on Slovenia’s hiking trails – frequently due to poor preparation. If you intend to hike in Slovenia, it is important to ensure that you plan your route in advance in accordance with your level of physical fitness, learn about the terrain, and bring appropriate equipment. In the event of emergency, call 112 to contact emergency services.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Slovenia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreigners.

Given the terrorist attacks that have taken place in other European cities, Irish citizens are advised to follow the advice of police and local authorities and to exercise a high level of vigilance, especially when travelling on public transport, if attending large public gatherings or other crowded locations. The attacks elsewhere indicate that they could occur at any time and could target tourist attractions, restaurants, transport hubs or other public areas. Citizens should remain aware of their surroundings and ensure they have access to exits or escape routes at all times.
