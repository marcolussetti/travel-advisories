## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter Slovenia, but please ensure that your passport is valid for the length of your stay. A number of airlines during the checking-in process require that a passport would also be valid on the date of the return flight. It is therefore advisable to renew a passport to ensure validity of the passport for the entire period of travel and any visa or other requirements.

If citizens intend staying in Slovenia for a long time, we advise you to register with the Irish Embassy in Slovenia.

### **Registration**

If you are you staying at a private address in Slovenia, your host must register you at the local police station within 72 hours. This is not necessary if you are staying in a hotel or at a campsite

### **Proof of identity**

Visitors must carry personal proof of identity at all times (passport, national ID document or driving licence). Anyone failing to produce photo ID when requested may be fined on the spot. The fines can range from €400 to €800, with a 50% reduction for fines paid within eight days. We recommend that you carry at least a photocopy of your passport or other identity document at all times, and original documentation where possible.

### **Money**

Slovenia uses the euro. ATMs are widely available and major credit cards/travellers’ cheques are accepted. You can withdraw cash from your Irish account if your ATM card has a Maestro or Cirrus symbol. Banks and bureaux de change will change travellers’ cheques, sterling and other main currencies.
