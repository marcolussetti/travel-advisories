## Local laws and customs

Remember, the national laws and local measures in municipalities such as Bled and other tourist destinations apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal. Fines are imposed for actions that are consisted antisocial such as littering.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Proof of Identity**

Visitors must carry personal proof of identity at all times (passport, national ID document or driving licence). Anyone failing to produce photo ID when requested may be fined on the spot. The fines can range from €400 to €800, with a 50% reduction for fines paid within eight days. We recommend that you carry at least a photocopy of your passport or other identity document at all times, and original documentation where possible.

### **Money**

Slovenia uses the euro. ATMs are widely available and major credit cards/travellers’ cheques are accepted. You can withdraw cash from your Irish account if your ATM card has a Maestro or Cirrus symbol. Banks and bureaux de change will change travellers’ cheques, sterling and other main currencies.
