## Local laws and customs

Remember, the national laws and local measures in municipalities such as Bled and other tourist destinations apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal. Fines are imposed for actions that are consisted antisocial such as littering.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.
