#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ljubljana for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

There is no change to entry requirements for Slovenian passport holders travelling directly to Ireland without transiting through the UK.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Slovenia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Slovenia. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you must obtain a residence registration certificate from the Slovenian authorities — further information is available on the Slovenian Government website [**here**](https://www.gov.si/en/topics/entry-and-residence/).

Visitors to Slovenia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

There has been severe flooding in recent years as well as disruption to normal weather patterns; Irish citizens visiting Slovenia are advised to regularly check on [**weather conditions**](https://meteo.arso.gov.si/met/en/) as circumstances have the potential to change rapidly.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbLjubljana**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbLjubljana) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyIrelandLjubljana/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Slovenia by dialling **112**. Police may also be contacted directly in an emergency by dialling **113**.
