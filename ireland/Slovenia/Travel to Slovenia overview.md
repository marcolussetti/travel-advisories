### **General Travel Advice**

A UEFA Conference League match between NK Celje and Shelbourne F.C. will take place in Celje on the 18th of December. Visitors attending the match should plan extra time for travel, follow local guidance on transport and crowd management, and stay aware of their surroundings. Standard safety precautions are advised around large public events.

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Slovenia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Slovenia. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you must obtain a residence registration certificate from the Slovenian authorities — further information is available on the Slovenian Government website [**here**](https://www.gov.si/en/topics/entry-and-residence/).

Visitors to Slovenia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

There has been severe flooding in recent years as well as disruption to normal weather patterns; Irish citizens visiting Slovenia are advised to regularly check on [**weather conditions**](https://meteo.arso.gov.si/met/en/) as circumstances have the potential to change rapidly.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbLjubljana**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbLjubljana) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyIrelandLjubljana/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**
