## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to enter Slovenia, but please ensure that your passport is valid for the length of your stay. A number of airlines during the checking-in process require that a passport would also be valid on the date of the return flight. It is therefore advisable to renew a passport to ensure validity of the passport for the entire period of travel and any visa or other requirements.

If citizens intend staying in Slovenia for a long time, we advise you to register with the Irish Embassy in Slovenia.

### **Registration**

If you are staying at a private address in Slovenia, your host must register you at the local police station within 72 hours. This is not necessary if you are staying in a hotel or at a campsite.
