## Climate and natural disasters

### **Seasonal Storms**

All parts of Slovenia can experience sudden, extreme storms. There can be strong winds and rain, snowfall, lightning and powerful hailstorms. Storms can cause landslides and road closures. Check weather and traffic reports before you travel. If you’re caught in a storm, find shelter until the storm passes and follow local advice.

### **Flooding**

Flash floods can be dangerous, happen with little warning and disrupt transport and other networks. Keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Wildfires**

During especially hot and dry periods there is a risk of wildfires. It’s illegal to do anything that starts a fire that poses a danger to human life or could cause significant damage.
