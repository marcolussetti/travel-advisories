## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish passport holders do not require a visa to enter Norway.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required to visit Norway and we advise to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay carry a photocopy at all times.

### **Staying for Longer than Three Months**

EU citizens living in Norway for more than 3 months must register themselves with the Norwegian Immigration authorities.

### **Svalbard**

While part of Norway, Svalbard is outside of the Schengen Zone, therefore you will be required to go through passport control upon entry and exit.
