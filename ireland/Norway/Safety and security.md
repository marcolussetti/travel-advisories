## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Petty crime does happen in Norway but at a low level compared to other European countries. However, be alert against mugging, bag-snatching and pick-pocketing, particularly in the airports and railway stations around Oslo and take sensible precautions.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Exercise normal precautions at night, avoid walking alone and stick to well-lit areas.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Norway, report it to the local police immediately. Citizens can contact the Embassy if assistance is required.

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in Norway are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained. However, distances between major cities and towns can be very long in some parts of the country and driving often takes longer than expected. Speed limits are often lower than what you may be familiar with in Ireland, be sure to adhere to speed limits at all times. You should exercise special caution in winter. Narrow roads in rural or suburban areas may be hazardous and impassable due to ice and snow.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. Roadside checks for alcohol are frequent, and submission to a breathalyser test is mandatory. The drink driving legal limit is 0.02% of blood alcohol. The Norwegian limit is lower than the Irish limit. Most people will exceed the Norwegian limit after one standard drink.
* Be aware of Norwayâ€™s traffic laws, such as speed limits, which are stricter than Ireland and rigorously enforced.
* Winter tyres are mandatory from approximately November to April. Different regions will have their own dates in which it is mandatory to drive with winter tyres. It is important to check requirements before you begin your journey.
* Throughout the year, keep headlights on at all times when driving.
* Note that Norway drives on the right.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Visiting the Arctic**

Arctic travel is increasingly popular with tourists, and most go by ship. Some areas of the Arctic are remote and require experienced guides to escort visitors. If travelling independently, it is important to inform someone of your travel plans and ensure you have all the necessary equipment with you.

### **Svalbard**

Travel beyond the limits of Longyearbyen in Svalbard requires that you are accompanied by a qualified person with a rifle due to risks of polar bear attacks. Do not travel beyond the town limits alone. Due to the unique flora and fauna there are strict environmental rules in place in Svalbard and travel to certain areas and certain activities are restricted. It is recommended that you travel with a recognised tour operator when travelling outside of Longyearbyen.
