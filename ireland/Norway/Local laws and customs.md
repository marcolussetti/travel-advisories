## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **General Laws and Customs**

While Norwegian society may seem similar to Ireland, visitors may not be aware of subtle legal and cultural differences. Norwegian family law, for example, can be very different from that of Ireland; visitors and long-term residents are encouraged to therefore familiarise themselves with local legal differences to avoid potential problems. Persons violating Norwayâ€™s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Avoid drugs of any kind when in Norway. A number of foreign tourists have been arrested in previous years in possession of khat, a substance illegal in Norway and Ireland but legal in some other European countries. Possession of even small quantities of any drug is strictly prohibited and laws are strictly enforced.

### **VAT**

Norway is not a member of the EU so you may be able to get refunds of the VAT on goods bought in the country, subject to certain minimum spends and conditions. VAT is normally refunded at the airport before you leave Norway. Many shops operate a VAT-refund shopping system for non-residents.

### **Money**

The currency is the Norwegian krone (NOK).

While cashpoints are available and accept foreign cards, the use of cash in Norway is becoming increasingly rare and some commercial outlets will now only accept payment via card. Be aware that foreign credit cards are not always accepted as a means of payment in some Norwegian supermarkets and petrol stations.
