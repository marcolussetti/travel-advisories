### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Norway.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU/EEA. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Norway. However, if staying for longer than three months, you are required to register your presence with the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet – UDI). Norway is a part of the EEA, not an EU member state however as an EU/EEA national you have the right to live, work and study in Norway. To find out more visit the [**UDI website for EU/EEA citizens**](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/residence-under-the-eueeu-regulations/?c=irl).

Visitors to Norway are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbOslo**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbOslo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyNorway/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
