## Additional information

A valid passport is required to visit Norway and we advise to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay carry a photocopy at all times. Irish passport holders do not require a visa to enter Norway but should note that all EU citizens living in Norway for more than 3 months must register themselves with the Norwegian Immigration authorities.

### **Money**

The currency is the Norwegian krone (NOK).

While cashpoints are available and accept foreign cards, the use of cash in Norway is becoming increasingly rare and some commercial outlets will now only accept payment via card. Be aware that foreign credit cards are not always accepted as a means of payment in some Norwegian supermarkets and petrol stations.

### **Visiting the Arctic**

Arctic travel is increasingly popular with tourists, and most go by ship. Some areas of the Arctic are remote and require experienced guides to escort visitors. If travelling independently, it is important to inform someone of your travel plans and ensure you have all the necessary equipment with you.

### **Svalbard**

While part of Norway, Svalbard is outside of the Schengen Zone, therefore you will be required to go through passport control upon entry and exit. Travel beyond the limits of Longyearbyen requires that you are accompanied by a qualified person with a rifle due to risks of polar bear attacks. Do not travel beyond the town limits alone. Due to the unique flora and fauna there are strict environmental rules in place in Svalbard and travel to certain areas and certain activities are restricted. It is recommended that you travel with a recognised tour operator when travelling outside of Longyearbyen.

For further information on travel and safety in Svalbard please see the Governor of Svalbard [**website**](https://www.sysselmesteren.no/en/).

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) purchasing a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

Emergency expenses

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

Irish Citizens are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay. Ensure that you get or renew your EHIC (formerly E111) before travel, and remember, one is needed for every person travelling.

[**Apply for your EHIC and find out more information**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so check with the hospital administrator beforehand.
