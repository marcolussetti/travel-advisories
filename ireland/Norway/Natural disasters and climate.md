## Natural disasters and climate

### **Visiting in summer**

We recommend insect repellent in summer months, particularly if planning to visit forests, lakes or mountainous regions. Ticks are prevalent in certain areas of the country. You can find more information on ticks [**here**](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/helse-og-miljo/insekter-og-skadedyr/ticks-how-to-avoid-and-remove/#:~:text=Ticks%20can%20be%20carried%20by,common%20throughout%20most%20of%20Europe.). Get local advice on weather conditions and suitable specialist equipment before going off the beaten track.

Swimming in either the fjords, seas or freshwater locations is very popular in the summer time in Norway but waters can be deep with unexpected currents. Make sure to seek out information on local swimming spots and when in doubt err on the side of caution, especially in remote locations. Many popular locations will have lifeguards during peak season, always swim within the permitted areas and follow directions of the lifeguards on site.

### **Visiting in winter**

The winter weather can last from October to April and temperatures can drop to well below freezing point. It is important to be prepared. Bring warm clothes and practical footwear to cope with icy roads and pavements. Visitors can buy special clamp-on shoe grips locally to give extra security in icy conditions. Get local advice on weather conditions and specialised equipment before you undertake any outdoor activities.
