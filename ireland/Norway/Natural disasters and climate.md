## Natural disasters and climate

### **Visiting in Summer**

We recommend insect repellent in summer months, particularly if planning to visit forests, lakes or mountainous regions. Ticks are prevalent in certain areas of the country. You can find more information on ticks [**here**](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/helse-og-miljo/insekter-og-skadedyr/ticks-how-to-avoid-and-remove/#:~:text=Ticks%20can%20be%20carried%20by,common%20throughout%20most%20of%20Europe.). Get local advice on weather conditions and suitable specialist equipment before going off the beaten track.

Swimming in either the fjords, seas or freshwater locations is very popular in the summer time in Norway but waters can be deep with unexpected currents. Make sure to seek out information on local swimming spots and when in doubt err on the side of caution, especially in remote locations. Many popular locations will have lifeguards during peak season, always swim within the permitted areas and follow directions of the lifeguards on site.

### **Visiting in Winter**

The winter weather can last from October to April and temperatures can drop to well below freezing point. It is important to be prepared. Bring warm clothes and practical footwear to cope with icy roads and pavements. Visitors can buy special clamp-on shoe grips locally to give extra security in icy conditions. Get local advice on weather conditions and specialised equipment before you undertake any outdoor activities. Check the local weather forecast at Yr.no, delivered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK).

Even experienced hikers and skiers are urged to exercise extreme caution when planning backcountry skiing and mountaineering trips (especially those traversing glaciers) due to avalanche risks. Conditions are changeable and can be hazardous and potentially life threatening. Consult regularly with weather and condition forecasting services and the advice of local guides and authorities. You should familiarise yourself with the avalanche warning information provided by Norwegian authorities via Varsom: [**Avalanche warnings | Varsom.no**](https://www.varsom.no/en/avalanches/avalanche-warnings/)(in English).

All travellers should be properly prepared and equipped for the local conditions. It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the advice of the authorities and engage experienced and certified guides. More information on guides is available via [**NORTIND - ENGLISH - Nortind**](https://www.nortind.no/en/)**.**

When driving during the winter months, you must have winter tyres on your car. Winter tyres are mandatory from November to April. Different regions will have their own dates during this time in which it is mandatory to drive with winter tyres. The length of time this requirement applies will vary from year to year. In the Nordland, Troms and Finnmark regions, there is a requirement for a tyre tread depth of at least 3 millimetres from October to April. In some places, you may need wheel chains for your tyres. Check the local requirements and regional dates before beginning your journey.
