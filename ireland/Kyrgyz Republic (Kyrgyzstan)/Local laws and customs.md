## Local laws and customs

### **Personal Identification**

Always carry your passports or notarised copies. The police can arrest those found without a form of identification.

Under Kyrgyz law, anyone claiming to be a police officer must present their credentials on demand. Don’t get into cars with anyone you don’t know, even if the person seems to be a police officer.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photography**

Taking photos of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality was legalised in 1998. However, homosexuality is not often discussed or recognised publicly. Care and discretion should be exercised at all times.

### **Banking**

Kyrgyzstan is a cash-only economy. Very few places accept credit cards and travellers’ cheques. There are only a handful of ATM machines, and none in rural areas.

### **Currency**

You should only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency; others may be difficult to exchange.
