## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens don’t need a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan if they’re travelling in the country for up to 60 days.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Kyrgyzstan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months prior to entry. Passport cards cannot be used.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a notarised photocopy of your passport at all times. You should ensure that you have entered your next of kin details into the back of your passport.

If you have questions about the entry requirements for Kyrgyzstan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Kyrgyzstan**](http://kyrgyz-embassy.org.uk/), which is in London. You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.
