## Travel to Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan) overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan for up to 60 days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Kyrgyzstan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months prior to entry. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on entry requirements for Kyrgyzstan, please contact the [**Embassy of Kyrgyzstan in London**](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/uk).

We advise you to only use officially-recognised border crossings and to only travel in the border areas if absolutely necessary.

Conflict can occur along the disputed Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms. There are also occasional security incidents on the Kyrgyz/Uzbek and Kyrgyz/Kazakh borders. There is a risk of further localised violence and border closures at any time.

The World Health Organisation recommends that travellers to Kyrgyzstan get vaccinated against measles at least 15 days prior to arrival.

Visitors to Kyrgyzstan are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens are highly encouraged to [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their travel with the Irish Embassy in Moscow, which is operating with reduced staffing at the current time.
