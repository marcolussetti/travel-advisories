## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens don’t need a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan if they’re travelling in the country for up to 60 days.

### **Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay you should carry a notarised photocopy of your passport at all times. You should ensure that you have entered your next of kin details into the back of your passport.

If you have questions about the entry requirements for Kyrgyzstan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Kyrgyzstan**](http://kyrgyz-embassy.org.uk/), which is in London. You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Kyrgyzstan.

Tuberculosis is widespread throughout the country and there are regular outbreaks of Hepatitis A, meningitis and brucellosis. Cases of AIDS and malaria have also been registered.

### **Medical facilities**

Medical facilities are not as developed as those in Ireland. Medication easily available in Ireland may not be as easily available in Kyrgystan or may be restricted.

### **Banking**

Kyrgyzstan is a cash-only economy. Very few places accept credit cards and travellers’ cheques. There are only a handful of ATM machines, and none in rural areas.

### **Currency**

You should only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency; others may be difficult to exchange.
