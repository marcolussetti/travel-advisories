## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Montserrat but you should take sensible precautions.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Reporting a Crime**
