## Safety and security

Irish citizens resident in Egypt are advised to take sensible precautions with regard to their personal safety and travel within the country. We request that citizens visiting and/or taking up residence register with the Embassy.

**In general, Irish citizens should be vigilant, follow the instructions of local authorities, respect restrictions on movement (including in and around religious sites and during religious festivals) and monitor local media (including social media) for up to date information.**

### **Terrorism**

There is a risk of terrorism across Egypt.Although the vast majority of attacks are targeted at the security services in specific areas, especially North Sinai, attacks occur without warning and have involved civilian casualties.

Although there are additional security measures in place to protect the country's major tourist resorts and sites, there is a risk that tourist areas and other places frequented by foreigners may be specifically targeted by terrorists.

Some terrorist attacks have targeted the Christian minority in Egypt, especially at remote monasteries and during pilgrimages.

There are occasional localised inter-faith community disputes which escalate quickly into more extreme violence. While most Coptic sites are well guarded by the security services, extreme caution should be observed when visiting them.

Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid security installations (police stations, road checkpoints, military bases) and significant Government buildings where possible. People who take photographs and videos of security installations or personnel vehicles and equipment or Government buildings have been arrested and had their cameras confiscated. The importation and use of recreational drones and similar equipment is strictly prohibited in Egypt.

There is some risk of kidnapping for travellers to Egypt in remote areas.

Irish citizens should avoid all travel to Northern Sinai, including the Taba-Suez road, where the security situation is extremely dangerous.

Independent travel to remote areas is strongly discouraged. The movement and presence of all foreign nationals in areas adjacent to the Libyan, Sudanese and Israeli borders is restricted under the terms of a Presidential decree which mandates the armed forces to take measures to safeguard the security of these areas. Border areas are now classified as either “forbidden” or “restricted” and travel to them will only be allowed if a special permit is obtained from the armed forces. The definition of these areas is not always clear and will not be obvious to independent travellers.

Irish citizens are strongly advised not to seek to travel to or from Gaza via the Rafah border crossing. The vicinity of the border crossing is particularly dangerous with frequent attacks on security forces. Rafah border crossing is also currently closed.

### **Protests and Demonstrations**

Although protests and demonstrations in Egypt are now relatively rare compared to the 2013 period, they can occur without warning and the police response to any protests can be harsh. Protests can also turn violent and result in large numbers of deaths and injuries. Under Egyptian law, anyone participating in an unauthorised protest or demonstrations can expect to be detained for an extended period.

Irish citizens are strongly advised to avoid all protests and demonstrations. If caught up in a demonstration, leave the area immediately. Do not attempt to take photographs or videos of demonstrations.

Closely monitor the local media (including social media) for updates on the situation.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Egypt but visitors should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and avoid using ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
* Be cautious of scammers and ‘tour guides’ in tourist areas, who target foreign nationals. Pre-book recommended guides or tours as much as possible, and only engage with official ticket offices.

If a victim of a crime while on holiday in Egypt, report it to the tourist police immediately. If citizens fail to do so before leaving Egypt, a case cannot be pursued and the Embassy may be limited in its ability to assist. Citizens can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Cairo if help is needed.

### **Sexual Harassment and Assault**

Women face particular challenges in Egypt. Sexual harassment is common on the street and in taxis. This can quickly escalate into sexual assault. What in Ireland is regarded as ordinary social interaction, for example eye contact and smiling, may be regarded in Egypt as flirtation. While it may be safer to travel in an Uber or the women-only carriages of the metro, vigilance must be maintained. Where possible, women should not travel alone and if travelling in a taxi/uber alone with a male driver, they should sit in the back seat behind the driver, share your live location and the details of your driver and trip with friends/family. It is advisable to cover your legs and arms when travelling outside of resorts, particularly during Ramadan or if visiting more religiously pious areas.

Sexual assault, including cases involving minors, is a growing issue in tourist resorts; citizens should take extra precautions to safeguard children and young people.

### **Scuba Diving**

Egypt is a very popular scuba diving destination. If not fully qualified, please ensure you are accompanied by a qualified, reputable instructor. The safety standards of diving operators in Egypt can vary considerably. Before diving, please consult with your doctor to ensure you are fit to dive. Diving beyond the depth limit specified in your insurance policy, or diving unaccompanied, can invalidate your cover.

### **Transport**

### **Driving**

Driving conditions in Egypt are hazardous, particularly at night outside major cities. Accidents are common and drivers often pay little heed to the rules of the road. Most sign-posts outside major cities are in Arabic only.

If driving:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Exercise extreme caution at all times.
* Avoid driving at night outside main urban areas.
* Know your routes.
* Be aware that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

### **Vehicle Hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check to have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public Transport**

Public transport in Egypt has a poor safety record. There have been numerous accidents in recent years involving buses, micro-buses, trains and metro services which have resulted in a considerable number of deaths, including foreign tourists. The train and metro network has also been the target of terrorist attacks. Where they are available, women should use the women-only carriages of trains.
