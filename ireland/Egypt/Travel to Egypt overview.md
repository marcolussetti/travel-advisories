## Travel to Egypt overview

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Regional tensions**

The Embassy of Ireland, Cairo is closely monitoring the current regional situation and advises that Irish citizens exercise a high degree of caution. Escalation could lead to travel disruption and other unanticipated impacts across the region.

#### **Irish citizens are strongly advised against:**

* travel to the Governorate of North Sinai including the Taba-Suez Road where the security situation is extremely dangerous;
* travel to Gaza via the Rafah border crossing (the vicinity of the Rafah border crossing is particularly dangerous at the moment and the border crossing is currently closed;
* independent travel to remote desert areas close to the Libyan and Sudanese borders.

#### **Irish citizens are advised to arrive by air if travelling to:**

* Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada and immediate surrounds and Marsa Alam and immediate surrounds;
* tourist areas in the Nile river (such as Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel). Irish citizens should be aware of the hazardous driving conditions in Egypt.

Terrorism presents a risk across Egypt. Irish citizens should remain vigilant, follow the instructions of local authorities, including any restrictions on movement in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, and monitor local media (including social media) for up-to-date information.

Irish citizens should also avoid the vicinity of major security/police or government buildings, and should not take photographs of security installations or personnel. Irish citizens should ensure that that they carry valid ID with them at all times. If caught in a demonstration, Irish citizens should not attempt to take photographs/ videos and should leave the area immediately.
