## Entry Requirements

### Passports

If visiting Egypt your passport should be valid for 6 months from date of arrival. However, also check with your travel provider to ensure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

### Visas

Irish citizens will normally need a visa to enter Egypt, which is usually available on arrival for tourists travelling on ordinary passports. If travelling to Egypt for work or business reasons it is recommended that you obtain a visa in advance. For further information about the entry requirements for Egypt, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the Embassy of Egypt in your resident country.

Irish citizens travelling to Sharm El Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba resorts only, for a maximum of 15 days, do not require a visa prior to travelling as a free entry permission stamp will be granted upon arrival. However, if you intend to travel outside of the these areas, or stay for longer than 15 days, you must obtain a Visa.

### **Regional Travel**

Visitors travelling between Egypt and Israel, may experience difficulties in or be refused entry to some other countries in the region if their passport has evidence of travel to Israel. This includes entry and exit stamps issued at the border crossings or if luggage has stickers indicating you have been to Israel.
