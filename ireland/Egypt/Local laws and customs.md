## Local laws and customs

### **Practical Advice**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behavior may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Identification**

Irish citizens should ensure that they carry valid I.D with them at all times.

### **Cultural Norms**

Egypt is a conservative and mostly Muslim society, visitors should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. We advise dressing conservatively, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if intending to visit religious areas. Both men and women will be expected to cover their legs to at least below the knee when visiting places of worship, including Christian churches. Women will be asked to cover their heads. If you do not wish to share the coverings offered by those places frequented by tourists or if planning to visit non-tourist sites, consider bringing a wide and long (and lightweight) scarf for this purpose.

During Ramadan, Muslims, who make up the majority of Egypt’s population, are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, visitors are advised not to eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **Local Laws**

While in Egypt, visitors are subject to local laws, including laws that may seem harsh by Irish standards. For example, the laws around custody of children are significantly different to those in force in Ireland. If you are a parent, you should be fully aware of your legal position. You should not surrender yours nor your children’s passports to a third party while in Egypt. If you have to deal with any legal matters in Egypt, particularly about family law, we strongly advise you to get professional legal advice. The Embassy of Ireland in Cairo can provide a sample list of lawyers if required.

### **Photography**

There are numerous restrictions in place and all photography in the vicinity of military installations is strictly prohibited. There have been incidents of tourists being arrested for taking photos outside government buildings, train stations and of other edifices such as bridges.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Public Drinking**

Drinking alcohol in the street and anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar is against the law.

### **LGBTQI+**

There is much ambiguity in Egyptian law about homosexuality. Although same-sex activity is not explicitly criminalised, the charge of “debauchery” has been used to prosecute LGBTQI+ people. Prosecutions are increasingly brought under the Cybercrime law for social media and dating app posts. There is also little public acceptance of homosexuality in Egypt and the Egyptian gay community is very cautious in public. Homophobia is common everywhere. Open displays of the rainbow flag have resulted in extraordinarily harsh police action against the LGBTQI+ community, including arrest and imprisonment. Gay men in particular have been targeted and convicted of breaching laws on public decency.

### **Marriages**

Irish citizens should be aware that efforts are frequently made to conclude fraudulent marriages usually with the intention of gaining residency and ultimately citizenship in Ireland. They should be aware that marriage to an Irish citizen does not guarantee that a visa will be granted to a non-Irish spouse. Irish citizens should also be aware that Egyptian family law is subject to religious affiliation. Polygamy is permitted in Egypt for Muslims and Muslim Egyptian men may in law marry again without advising either the new spouse or any existing spouse of the new marriage. We strongly advise Irish citizens planning to marry Egyptians to ensure they have a thorough knowledge of their prospective spouse.
