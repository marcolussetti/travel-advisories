## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Guinea-Bissau. Passports must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of entry. Passport cards cannot be used.

Citizens can apply for a visa in person at diplomatic missions of Guinea-Bissau, such as the Embassy in Paris (Rue St Lazare 94) or the Embassy in Lisbon (Rua da Alcolena 17A).

The cost of a visa depends on the length of stay: 45 days (€70.00), 90 days (€110.00) or 180 days (€200.00).

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport and to also carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen while in Guinea-Bissau you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Lisbon**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/portugal/lisbon/). We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is needed if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.
