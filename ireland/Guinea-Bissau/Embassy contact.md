## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Guinea-Bissau, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Lisbon, Portugal**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/portugal/lisbon/).

Please note that if assistance is required in the case of emergency while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy number, 00 351 213308200, and leave a message for the Duty Officer. This mailbox will be monitored regularly.

Alternatively, please call the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs at 00353 1 408 2000.

Monday to Friday 09:30-12:30
