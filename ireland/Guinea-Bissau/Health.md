### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but information can be obtained from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case your medication is lost.
