Visitors to Guinea-Bissau are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises:

* To avoid non-essential travel to the northwest part of the country that borders the Casamance region in Senegal as there may still be land mines present in this area as a result of recent armed conflict.
* Against all travel to the area within 20 km of the border with Senegal, including the road from São Domingos to Mpack, Senegal.

In view of the potential for risks to personal security, protests, demonstrations and large public gatherings should be avoided. Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations and in the event of any social unrest, visitors should follow the advice of local authorities.
