## Natural disasters and climate

### **Geographical position**

Indonesia sits along a volatile seismic strip called the ‘Ring of Fire’ in the Pacific Ocean. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur regularly, often with a potential threat of tsunamis. The capacity of the Indonesian emergency and rescue services, and local authorities, to deal with large natural disasters is limited.

### **Earthquake**

If travelling to or living in Indonesia, make sure to know what to do in the event of an earthquake. Tsunamis as a result of earthquakes are also a regular occurrence throughout Indonesia, which can affect low lying areas such as beaches or river valleys.

### **Volcanoes**

There are many volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt without warning. Visitors should exercise caution, check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to volcanic areas.

Volcanic activity throughout Indonesia **frequently affects** flight schedules and the operation of regional airports, including Lombok and Bali International Airports. Please heed the advice and guidance of local authorities, adhere to exclusion zones around volcanoes, and maintain contact with airlines and tour operators before travelling.

### **Flooding**

Flash floods and more widespread flooding occur regularly. Cities, especially Jakarta, are frequently subject to severe localised flooding which can result in major disruption, and occasional fatalities.

### **Air Pollution**

Air quality in Jakarta and other major cities is very poor. More generally within Indonesia, air quality can be compromised seasonally on account of smoke haze. This improves with the onset of the monsoon season. Visitors should monitor information on air quality regularly and follow local advice.
