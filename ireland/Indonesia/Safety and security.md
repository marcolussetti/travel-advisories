## Safety and security

Citizens are strongly encouraged to [**Register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) your details with the Embassy.

### **Civil Unrest**

Public demonstrations can occasionally occur in Indonesian cities, and have the potential to turn violent. Travellers are advised to avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and to keep informed of any updates with local media.

Visitors to Indonesia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay informed on what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

### **Terrorism**

There is a significant threat of terrorism in Indonesia. Terrorist groups have the capacity and intent to carry out attacks at any time and anywhere in the country. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places where large groups of people gather or which are known to be frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers: beach resorts, bars and restaurants, hotels and shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets, tourist attractions, places of worship, ferry terminals and airports. Attacks may also target Indonesian Government and law enforcement bodies.

### **Crime**

Visitors should always take sensible precautions while in Indonesia:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Make sure that you are comfortable with, and regularly review, your security arrangements.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Indonesia, report it to the local police immediately. If in need of consular assistance, please contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Jakarta.**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/indonesia/jakarta/)

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen, report this to the Police immediately and obtain a Police Report. A lost passport can delay travel plans considerably, and incur costs.

Please be aware that you will need to visit the Embassy of Ireland in Jakarta in-person if you require an Emergency Travel Certificate.

### Emergency Travel Certificate

Irish citizens who have lost their passport while visiting Indonesia may be able to obtain a one-way Emergency Travel Certificate to return to Ireland or their country of residence. Emergency Travel Certificates are valid for 72 hours and can be used for a single journey only.

Irish citizens who need an Emergency Travel Certificate should contact the Embassy of Ireland at +62 21 2809 4300 or [**via this form**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/indonesia/jakarta/contact/)**.**

Emergency travel certificates can only be issued at the Embassy of Ireland in Jakarta. Irish citizens must present in-person at the Embassy.

The following documentation is required before an Emergency Travel Certificate can be issued:

* Emergency travel document fee of IDR 500,000. An additional fee of IDR 1,300,000 will be applied if the emergency travel certificate is processed outside of normal office hours (09.00 – 16.00). Fees can be paid in cash at the Embassy or via bank transfer.

**Important**: Some countries do not accept Emergency Travel Certificates, including for transit purposes. **Applicants should check that an Emergency Travel Certificate will be accepted in their countries of transit or residence before they apply for the certificate and before finalising travel arrangements.**

If provided with an Emergency Travel Certificate, an application for a new passport should be submitted as soon as possible. Your previous passport will be registered as lost and will be cancelled.

### **Driving and other forms of transport**

Caution should be exercised when driving in Indonesia, as driving standards vary. Bring a full Irish and international driving license. **You should** **have adequate and appropriate insurance.**

Motorcycle accidents are common on the Islands of Bali and Lombok. Only experienced drivers should use motorbikes and mopeds and all necessary safety precautions should be taken, including wearing a helmet.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise do not hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

**You should have adequate insurance** and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

If hiring or renting a vehicle ensure it is only from a trusted company that requires a driving license, International travel license and medical insurance.

### **Local Alcohol**

A number of local and tourist deaths in Indonesia have been caused by the consumption of locally-brewed alcohol and rice wine, or 'arak', which has been contaminated with methanol. We advise all travellers, especially in Bali, Lombok and Gili Islands, not to consume this drink. Avoid purchasing alcohol outside of licenced establishments.

### **Air Safety**

Aviation infrastructure in Indonesia is sometimes overstretched, and the difficult terrain and climatic conditions also contribute to a heightened risk. There have been a number of serious incidents in recent years. Travellers should be aware of these risks, and are advised to take care in choosing airlines, flights and routes.

### **Maritime Safety**

Take extra care, when travelling by boat between islands. Boats can capsize in stormy weather. It is advisable to where a lifejacket at all times when travelling by boat.

Many beaches in particular on the south coast of Java and Bali, are unsuitable for swimming.

Diving in Indonesia is a high-risk sport, with dangerous sea currents and unpredictable water conditions. **Only experienced divers should partake in this sport** and should adhere to the local laws and safety regulations. It is potentially dangerous to fly too soon after diving, so plan your travel around diving carefully, following guidance of reputable international diving organisations.

Diving is considered an adventure sport by many insurance companies and may not be covered by standard travel or medical insurance policies. **Ensure that your travel and medical insurance policies cover you for diving activities**. Diving beyond the depth limit specified in your insurance policy, or diving unaccompanied, can invalidate your insurance cover.

It is strongly advised to participate in diving tours only if you hold a valid open water diving licence that is accredited by a reputable international diving organisation following your participation in an intensive training course (usually spanning five days). Use only diving schools and diving masters that are properly certified by international diving organisations. Before diving, you should consult with a doctor to ensure that you are fit to dive.

### **Water**

Do not drink local tap water. Drink or use boiled or bottled water only while visiting Indonesia.
