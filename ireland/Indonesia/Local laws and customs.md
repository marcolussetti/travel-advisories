## Local laws and customs

You must carry a copy of your passport or other photographic identification with you at all times.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them.

Visitors should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of their actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan or if intending to visit religious areas. Sharia law is enforced in Aceh (Northern Sumatra) and may exist unofficially or through local legislation in other areas.

It is important to avoid offending Muslim sensitivities. Westerners have occasionally been harassed by fundamentalists in bars and nightclubs, particularly around major Islamic holidays such as Ramadan.

Indonesia has introduced legislation which bans extra-marital sexual relations and cohabitation by unmarried couples. The new law applies equally to Indonesian and foreign residents as well as tourists, however enforcement is complaint-based, requiring reports submitted by close family members.

### **Illegal Drugs**

**Possession, trafficking and manufacture of narcotics are serious offences in Indonesia.** Those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process.

Police often raid locations (particularly in Bali) known to be frequented by foreigners, and may require an individual to take a urine or blood test where they have reasonable suspicion that drugs have been taken. Drug use or the possession of even small amounts of narcotic drugs such as marijuana or ecstasy can lead to prison sentences upwards of four years. Convicted traffickers or users of hard drugs such as cocaine or heroin face the death penalty in Indonesia.

### **LGBT**

While homosexual activity is not criminalised, there is very little tolerance for it. Provincial governments in some parts of the country, such as Aceh (Northern Sumatra), have enacted prohibitions, and punishment, in this regard. Caution and discretion are advised at all times for LGBT visitors.

### **Personal Identification**

Evidence of identity may be requested by, for example, the police. Always carry photocopies of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid losing the original, which should be kept in a safe place.

Visitors may also be asked for their passport when entering public areas such as shopping malls.

### **Gambling**

Gambling is illegal in Indonesia.
