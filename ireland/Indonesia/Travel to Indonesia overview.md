## Travel to Indonesia overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Travellers to Indonesia must have a passport with a **minimum validity of six months beyond date of departure, there are no exceptions to this regulation.**

Travellers should ensure that their **passports are not damaged** **in any way, as otherwise they can be refused admission at the port of entry.**

It is strongly advised to get comprehensive travel insurance that covers all planned activities.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Indonesia. Travellers to Indonesia can apply for an [**Electronic Visa on Arrival (e-VOA)**](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/) at a cost of IDR 500,000.

The e-VoA is a single-entry visa which is valid for 30 days in Indonesia with the purpose of tourism, business meetings, goods purchasing, or transit.

The e-VoA can be extended once (by an additional 30 days maximum) by applying to a local Indonesian immigration office. Travellers should extend their visa within the initial 30 days to avoid a visa overstay fine. Holders of any travel document other than a passport are not eligible to apply for the e-VoA. A full list of the types of visas travellers can obtain for Indonesia and the requirements for these is on the official [**Indonesian immigration website**](https://www.imigrasi.go.id/en/).

Indonesia has introduced a single digital entry form called [**All Indonesia**](https://allindonesia.imigrasi.go.id/). It combines immigration, customs, and health declarations into one online process, replacing separate forms. Upon completion of the process, you are required to present the generated QR code to both the Immigration and Customs checkpoints at the airport. You can complete All Indonesia form up to 3 days before your departure.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy X [**@IrlEmbIndonesia**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbIndonesia?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
