## Travel to Indonesia overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Travellers to Indonesia must hold a passport with a **minimum validity of six months beyond date of arrival. There are no exceptions to this regulation.**

Travellers should ensure that their **passport is not damaged** **in any way, otherwise they may be refused entry to Indonesia.**

It is strongly advised to purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers all planned activities.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Indonesia. Travellers to Indonesia can apply for a [**Visa on Arrival (VoA)**](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/)at a cost of IDR 500,000, either online or in-person upon arrival.

Travellers should ensure that they have an exit ticket from Indonesia booked prior to entry. Travellers presenting a one-way ticket only for a short stay visa will be denied entry.

Indonesia has introduced a single digital entry form called [**All Indonesia**](https://allindonesia.imigrasi.go.id/). It combines an arrival card, customs, and health declarations into one online process, replacing separate forms. Upon completion of the process, you are required to present the generated QR code to both the Immigration and Customs checkpoints at the airport. You can complete the All Indonesia form up to 3 days before your departure or upon arrival at the airport.
