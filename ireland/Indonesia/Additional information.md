### **Emergency Travel Certificate**

Irish citizens who have lost their passport while visiting Indonesia, may be able to get a one-way emergency travel certificate to return to Ireland or country of residence. Emergency travel certificates are valid for 72 hours and can be used for a single journey only.

If resident in Indonesia and have lost your passport you should apply for a [**new passport**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Irish citizens who need an Emergency Travel Certificate, should contact the Embassy of Ireland at +6221-28094300 or [**via this form**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/indonesia/jakarta/contact/)

Emergency travel certificates can be issued only at the Embassy of Ireland in Jakarta. Irish citizens must present in person at the Embassy, in order to be issued one.

The following documentation is required before an emergency travel certificate can be issued:

* Emergency travel document fee of IDR 500,000. An additional fee of IDR 1,300,000 will be applied if the emergency travel certificate is processed outside of normal office hours (09.00 – 16.00). Fees can be paid in cash at the Embassy or via bank transfer.
* Photographic ID
* Proof of address in country of residence
* Copy of Long Birth Certificate

**Important**: Some countries do not accept emergency travel certificates, including for transit purposes. **Applicants should check that an emergency travel certificate will be accepted in their countries of transit or residence before they apply for the emergency travel certificate and before finalising travel arrangements.**

If provided with an emergency travel certificate, an application for a new passport should be submitted as soon as possible.

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visa**

The electronic Visa on Arrival (VoA) is available to Irish citizens travelling to Indonesia.

To avail of Visa on Arrival you can only enter Indonesia only through 19 designated Immigration Border Control points (see below).

Irish citizens must show a valid passport with at least 6 months validity from the date of their departure from Indonesia , a return ticket or connecting ticket to continue traveling to another country and evidence of travel insurance (which must cover COVID-19 related treatments). The VoA fee is Rp. 500,000 and can be paid upon arrival at a designed Immigration Border Control point. The stay permit can be extended once for 30 days for an additional Rp. 500,000. Visa holders can apply for an extension at their nearest immigration office.

VoA cannot be transferred into another stay permit. The holder is also not eligible to apply for an onshore visa.

For more details on the VoA scheme please visit the website of the [**Embassy of Indonesia in London**](https://kemlu.go.id/london/id/news/18631/visa-on-arrival-voa-untuk-pelaku-perjalanan-luar-negeri).

An International Tourist Levy applies to all international travellers **to Bali only.** This will require a one-time payment on arrival in Bali of IDR 150,000 in addition to any visa payment required. This levy must also be paid by international travellers arriving in Bali from another location within Indonesia.

### **Passports**

Irish passports must be valid for a minimum of six months after the conclusion of any trip to Indonesia and other countries within South East Asia, as otherwise entry may not be allowed. It is also advisable to carry a number of photocopies of your passport with you while travelling. **Damaged passports – even if the damage is minor - will result in a refusal of entry by immigration officials at the ports of entry.**

### **Health**

**You should have adequate medical insurance before departure travelling to Indonesia to cover any costs you may incur.** **High quality treatment and medical evacuation are very expensive.**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to confirm what, if any, medical vaccinations may be required. There are a number of tropical diseases in Indonesia such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis and dengue, which can be transmitted by mosquito bites. It is best to avoid mosquito bites when possible, by keeping covered and applying repellents. Other diseases that are found in Indonesia include rabies, tuberculous, hepatitis, typhoid, measles and cholera. We recommend that you book an appointment with your GP at least 8 weeks before your intended travel to discuss your vaccine requirements.

Please note that local law requires that citizens who are bringing medication into the country must also provide a doctor’s letter confirming the prescription and outlining the necessity of the medication, as well as the original prescription itself. All medication being brought in must be in its original packaging and cover the duration of the stay only.

Should medical attention be required, please be aware that health and medical care standards in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. Good medical treatment can be very expensive. In remote areas, high quality services for serious injury or illness are unlikely to be available.
