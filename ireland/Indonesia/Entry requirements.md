## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

The electronic Visa on Arrival (e-VoA) is available to Irish citizens travelling to Indonesia. You can apply for this using the [**All Indonesia platform**.](https://allindonesia.imigrasi.go.id/)

Alternatively, you can apply for a Visa on Arrival (VoA) in person upon your arrival to your port of entry in Indonesia. You can only make the in-person applications at designated Immigration Border Control points.

The Visa on Arrival fee is IDR 500,000 and can be paid upon arrival at a designed Immigration Border Control point. The visa can be extended once for 30 days for an additional IDR 500,000. Visa holders can apply for an extension at their nearest immigration office.

A Visa on Arrival cannot be changed into another type of stay permit. The holder is also not eligible to apply for an onshore visa.

For more details on the VoA scheme please visit the website of the [**Embassy of Indonesia in London**](https://consular.indonesianembassy.org.uk/faq/)**.**

Irish citizens must show a valid passport with at least 6 months validity from the date of their departure from Indonesia, a return ticket or connecting ticket to continue traveling to another country and evidence of travel insurance.

An International Tourist Levy applies to all international travellers **to Bali only.** This will require a one-time payment on arrival in Bali of IDR 150,000 in addition to any visa payment required. This levy must also be paid by international travellers arriving in Bali from another location within Indonesia. Information on requirements and how to pay the Tourist Levy can be found [**here**](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/faq).

If unsure of the entry/exit requirements for Indonesia, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](https://kemlu.go.id/portal/en/page/29/kedutaan_konsulat) of Indonesia

### **Passport**

Irish passports must be valid for a minimum of six months after the conclusion of any trip to Indonesia and other countries within South East Asia, as otherwise entry may not be allowed. It is also advisable to carry a number of photocopies of your passport with you while travelling. **Damaged passports – even if the damage is minor - will result in a refusal of entry by immigration officials at the ports of entry.**

### **Lost or Stolen Passport - Emergency Travel Certificate**

Irish citizens who have lost their passport while visiting Indonesia, may be able to get a one-way emergency travel certificate to return to Ireland or country of residence. Emergency travel certificates are valid for 72 hours and can be used for a single journey only.

If resident in Indonesia and have lost your passport you should apply for a [**new passport**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/).

Irish citizens who need an Emergency Travel Certificate, should contact the Embassy of Ireland at +6221-28094300 or [**via this form**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/indonesia/jakarta/contact/)

Emergency travel certificates can be issued only at the Embassy of Ireland in Jakarta. Irish citizens must present in person at the Embassy, in order to be issued one.
