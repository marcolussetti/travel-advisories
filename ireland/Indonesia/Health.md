## Health

**You should have adequate medical insurance before departure travelling to Indonesia to cover any costs you may incur.** **High quality treatment and medical evacuation are very expensive.**

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to confirm what, if any, medical vaccinations may be required. There are a number of tropical diseases in Indonesia such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis and dengue, which can be transmitted by mosquito bites. It is best to avoid mosquito bites when possible, by keeping covered and applying repellents. Other diseases that are found in Indonesia include rabies, tuberculous, hepatitis, typhoid, measles and cholera. We recommend that you book an appointment with your GP at least eight weeks before your intended travel to discuss your vaccine requirements.

### **Medication**

Please note that local law requires that citizens who are bringing medication into the country must also provide a doctorâ€™s letter confirming the prescription and outlining the necessity of the medication, as well as the original prescription itself. All medication being brought in must be in its original packaging and cover the duration of the stay only.

### **Medical Treatment**

Should medical attention be required, please be aware that health and medical care standards in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. Good medical treatment can be very expensive. In remote areas, high quality services for serious injury or illness are unlikely to be available.
