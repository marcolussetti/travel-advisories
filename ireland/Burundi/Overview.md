### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Burundi. Visas (business or tourist) can be obtained on arrival at Bujumbura Airport, and any land or maritime entry points. A month-long visa costs $90 and a 3 day-long visa costs $40. For further information on visas, contact the Burundi Embassy in London or the Burundian Embassy in Kigali (+250 252 575512) if you are travelling from Rwanda.

A valid passport is required for travel to Burundi. Irish passports should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visa and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Burundi are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (Twitter [**@IrlEmbTanzania**](https://twitter.com/irlembtanzania?lang=en))to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if visitors have problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Burundi by dialling 112 for medical assistance or 113 for police.
