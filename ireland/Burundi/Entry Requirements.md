## Entry Requirements

### Visas

Visas (business or tourist) can be obtained on arrival at Bujumbura Airport, and any land or maritime entry points. A month-long visa costs $90 and a 3 day-long visa costs $40. For further information on visas, contact the Burundi Embassy in London or the Burundian Embassy in Kigali (+250 252 575512) if you are travelling from Rwanda.

### **Passports**

Your passport should be valid for the duration of your proposed stay. Check with your travel provider to ensure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.

It's advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Burundi and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while youâ€™re abroad, we can help by issuing you an emergency travel document that will get you home.

We'll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Burundi there may be additional complications in issuing an emergency travel document.

Irish citizens should contact the Embassy in Dar es Salaam to find out what is needed to apply for an emergency travel document. They Embassy can advise on the fees which apply.
