## Safety and security

### **Civil unrest**

Burundi has experienced political instability in recent years. The situation remains volatile and sporadic outbreaks of violence and civil unrest continue to occur. Grenade attacks are common, and often politically motivated. Travellers should limit their movements, avoid large gatherings and remain vigilant at all times.

### **Terrorism**

There's a general threat from terrorism in Burundi. Al-Shabaab has previously made public threats against Burundi and has claimed responsibility for attacks in Kenya and Uganda.

### **Kidnapping**

There's a high risk of kidnapping near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Armed groups operate in this area. Cross-border incursions by rebel groups also occur.

### **Crime**

Crime levels are increasing in Burundi and muggings at gun and knife point, burglary, and armed car hijackings have all been reported. Travellers should take sensible precautions:

* Arrange guards for homes and stay at hotels that have good security
* Don't carry credit/debit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don't carry your passport unless absolutely necessary. Keep copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don't use ATMs after dark, especially if you're alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations.
* Avoid walking in the streets after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre

### **Reporting crime**

If you're a victim of a crime while in Burundi, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you're planning to drive in Burundi, you should be extremely careful and avoid driving outside of Bujumbura after dark. Any travel outside Bujumbura should take place in a convoy of at least two vehicles.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driver's licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you're stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you're hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you're allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
