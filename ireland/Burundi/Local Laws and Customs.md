## Local Laws and Customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexual acts are illegal. We advise travellers to exercise caution and discretion.

### **Photography**

You should request permission before taking photographs of military installations, airports, and government buildings.

### **Money**

The economy in Burundi is cash-based and credit cards are not widely accepted. While some ATMs can be found, they are unreliable and not secure to use. Euros and US dollars printed after the year 2003 are the most easily-exchangeable currencies.
