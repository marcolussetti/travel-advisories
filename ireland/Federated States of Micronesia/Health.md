## Health

### **Medical Facilities**

If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for assistance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as youâ€™re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Medical facilities in FSM are limited but adequate for uncomplicated treatment. Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalisation or evacuation may be very expensive. Emergency treatment or treatment for serious conditions is limited and so you may be medically evacuated to another country. This can take time to arrange and costs can escalate quickly, so make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

### Vaccinations

Cases of measles have been reported in FSM. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date.
