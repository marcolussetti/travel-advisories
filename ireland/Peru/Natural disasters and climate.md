### **Earthquakes**

Peru is in an earthquake zone and tremors are frequent. Check with tour operators or local authorities for current updates before visiting the area.

### **Tsunamis and High tides**

Although tsunamis are rare in Peru higher tides are often experienced either after an earthquake or for other reasons throughout the year.

### **Landslides**

Landslides, mudslides and flooding can take place during the rainy season in Peru (November to April). They can make local travel difficult, particularly in mountainous areas and can sometimes cause death or serious injury, as was the case with the floods on the Northern Coast in March 2023. If planning to travel in Peru, keep up to date with current weather conditions via local guides, travel agents or local tourist information point. Always take local advice if travelling overland in areas affected by floods and contact your tour operator before you begin your journey to find out if your planned route is open.

### **Wildfires**

Many parts of Peru can be affected by wildfires. Wildfires are dangerous, unpredictable, and fast moving. We advise you to stay informed of developments, stay away from affected areas and comply with evacuation orders or instructions from the emergency services, police and local authorities.
