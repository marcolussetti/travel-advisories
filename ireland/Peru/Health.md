### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever is a potentially serious disease transmitted by mosquito bites, typically characterised by flu like symptoms, including fever, muscle and joint pain, and is endemic to Peru. In February 2024, a State of Public Health Emergency was declared in 20 of Peruâ€™s 25 regions in response to a growing incidence of dengue fever.

Irish citizens in Peru are advised to follow the recommendations of local health authorities and to take precautions to protect yourself from mosquitos. More information on dengue fever can be found on the website of the [**Peruvian Ministry of Health**](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minsa/campa%C3%B1as/8255-campana-de-prevencion-y-control-del-dengue)**.**

### **Zika Virus**

There have been outbreaks of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/)

### **Yellow Fever**

If visitors plan on travelling in Latin America, a Yellow Fever Certificate may be required. Confirm with the authorities of your next destination whether they require a certificate following a visit to Peru.

### **Altitude**

The altitude in Cusco, Machu Picchu, Puno and Lake Titicaca can cause problems for travellers, particularly those who suffer from lung, heart or chest problems. Healthy travellers may also feel the effects of the lack of oxygen.
