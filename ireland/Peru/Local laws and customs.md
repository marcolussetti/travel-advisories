## Local laws and customs

### **Illegal drugs**

Drug trafficking is a serious crime in Peru and drug smugglers face severe penalties, usually long prison terms. Pack your luggage yourself and keep it with you at all times. Do not carry anything through customs for anybody else. We advise against taking coca leaves/coca tea out of the country.

### **Age of consent**

Sex with minors (anyone under 18 is considered a minor in Peru) is illegal. Offenders will face long term jail sentences.

### **Archeological artefacts**

Visitors are not allowed to take any archaeological artefacts from the country without the proper authority.

### **Souvenirs**

The sale of souvenirs made with any animal parts, including condor feathers, is illegal. These feathers are often sold in tourist markets in Cusco.

### **LGBT travellers**

Homosexuality is legal in Peru but social attitudes are generally conservative. Any outward display of homosexual behaviour could lead to negative attention. Same-sex partnerships are not formally recognised.

### **Military installations**

Visitors should avoid taking photographs of anything of a military nature.
