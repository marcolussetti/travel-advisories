## Overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

### **Yellow Fever**

The Ministry of Health of Peru has announced [epidemiological alert](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minsa/noticias/1130076-minsa-emite-alerta-epidemiologica-por-fiebre-amarilla-e-intensifica-acciones-en-amazonas-huanuco-y-san-martin) due to the sharp rise in yellow fever cases. In particular, there has been a rise in cases in areas of the Peruvian Amazon, including the districts of Huanuco, San Martin, and Amazonas.

While not required by Peruvian authorities, Irish citizens may wish to get vaccinated against Yellow Fever at least 10 days prior to travel. In addition, if Irish citizens plan on travelling elsewhere in Latin America, a Yellow Fever Certificate may be required. Confirm with the authorities of your next destination whether a certificate is required following a visit to Peru.

### **States of Emergency**

States of Emergency declared many years ago as well as those more recently declared are in force throughout many regions of Peru. A State of Emergency declared for security reasons gives the armed forces responsibility for law and order. A State of Emergency declared for natural disasters or health alerts means that the standard service providers in the region cannot guarantee normal services and frequently need help from central government; however, in these cases the armed forces do not take responsibility for law and order.

When a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to restrict freedom of movement, conduct search and seizures, and detain persons of interest.

If visitors do decide to visit any area under a state of emergency they should follow instructions given by police, military or other officials. You can read a list of the areas with a state of emergency in [**El Peruano**](https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas) official newspaper (in Spanish).

### **General Travel Advice**

Protests in Lima often happen in the historic centre, but can also spread to other areas. Other regions that have seen protests include Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cusco, La Libertad, Madre de Dios and Puno. Irish citizens throughout Peru should avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Irish citizens in Peru should be aware that travel to some parts of the country, especially tourist locations in the south, may not be possible. Train services, including those to and from Machu Picchu, are occasionally suspended or disrupted because of protests.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Peru for stays up to 183 days.

A valid passport is required for travel to Peru. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Peru are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
