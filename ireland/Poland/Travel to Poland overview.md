## Travel to Poland overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine together with our EU and other international partners. **The Department strongly advises against all travel to Ukraine, for any purpose.** More information can be found [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/).

If you have crossed into Poland from Ukraine and are in need of assistance, please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Warsaw [**here.**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/poland/warsaw/)

We encourage all Irish citizens in Poland to [**register their details**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy and to monitor our social media channels for the latest updates.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Poland.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Poland. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are obliged to register your presence with your local authority. More information can be found [**here**](https://www.gov.pl/web/mswia-en/registration-of-residence).

Visitors to Poland are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbWarsaw**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbWarsaw) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AmbasadaIrlandii/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Poland by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 997
* Fire brigade: 998
* Ambulance: 999
