## Local laws and customs

### **Personal identification**

Under Polish law, if asked by Polish police, you must verify your identity by presenting photographic identification. As well as your passport, which we do not advise you carry unless absolutely necessary, you should carry another form of identification while in Poland, such as a driving licence or Passport Card. The Passport Card fits easily into a wallet and can be used for travel within the EU/EEA and Switzerland. It is available to Irish citizens, aged 18 and over, who hold a valid Irish passport with at least 6 months remaining validity.

### **Currency**

The currency in Poland is the Złoty. This is available from currency exchange providers in Poland called ‘kantor’. ATMs are available in all major cities and towns. Visitors can also pay by credit or debit card in most shops, bars and restaurants.

### **Alcohol**

It is against the law to consume alcohol in public places in Poland and fines may be imposed.

Public drunkenness (i.e. in the streets, on public transport, etc.) may be dealt with very severely by the Polish authorities, who have the right to detain people overnight in detoxification centres. If detained overnight in a detoxification centre, you must pay for the cost of the stay.

The drink-drive limit in Poland is 0.2 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood, which is lower than in Ireland (0.5 milligrams).

### **Public Transport**

Public transport tickets can be purchased at ticket machines located at main bus and tram stops. Tickets must be validated at the start of a journey in the small yellow machine on the bus or tram. Visitors will be fined on the spot if caught travelling without a ticket or with an invalid ticket. Digital tickets can also be purchased through mobile applications such as ‘Jakdojade’, with real-time information on transport connections in Polish cities.

### **Taxis**

Make sure to order a taxi from an official and reputable company. Official city taxis will have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and information about price on the window.

If ordering through a ride-share application such as Uber or Bolt, make sure that the details of the driver and car are correct before departure. Also ensure that you are familiar with the safety and emergency features available in the application.

### **LGBT Travellers**

Homosexuality is legal in Poland, but there is still a degree of intolerance among some sections of the population. Visitors can find general guidance on travel for the LGBT+ community [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/know-before-you-go/lgbtqi/).

Poland does not recognise marriage or civil partnership between two persons of the same sex. This can have implications should you or your spouse become ill as you may not be recognised as the next of kin. We advise visitors to explore the possibility of bringing written consent for you and your spouse, to authorise them to access your medical information should visitors become ill or require hospitalisation. The Embassy can help to find English-speaking lawyers in Poland.

### **Hen/stag parties**

Stag and hen parties can often have a reputation for being disruptive for local communities. Please be sensitive to this and respectful of residents during your stay in Poland.

### **Photography**

Taking photographs of facilities considered of strategic importance to the security or defence, and critical infrastructure, of Poland may result in a penalty. These sites could include, but are not limited to: military installations, warehouses of strategic reserves, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, certain seaports, communication infrastructure facilities, and facilities of the National Bank of Poland and Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego. Please obey any signage which prohibits photos at such sites. If in doubt, seek permission from local authorities before taking photographs.
