## Dual Nationals

Under Polish law, Polish citizens with dual citizenship are treated as Polish while in Poland, even if they hold another countryâ€™s passport.

If you have dual Irish-Polish citizenship, Polish authorities may request to see a Polish passport or ID, for example, when entering or leaving Poland.

As an Irish-Polish dual citizen, you will be treated as Polish by the Polish authorities if arrested or detained in Poland. You will have the same rights as any other Polish citizen in these circumstances (including the right to legal representation).

The Embassy will endeavour to provide assistance to all Irish citizens in Poland but may only be able to offer limited consular assistance if also a Polish citizen.
