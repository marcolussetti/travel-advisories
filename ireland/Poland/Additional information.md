## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Poland.

We advise visitors to have a copy or scan of their passport information page available during their stay in case required.

### **Climate**

‌Polish winters can be very harsh by Irish standards. The average temperature in January is about -4'C but can fall as low as -25'C. It is essential to be properly dressed for the weather if travelling to Poland in the winter months.

Polish summers can be hot, with temperatures rising to over 35’C. It is important to wear appropriate clothing and to use sunscreen in the summer months.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Embassy cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses arising from a personal emergency while abroad. An appropriate travel insurance policy should cover these costs provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money and stress if something goes wrong. It will also assist you to get the medical attention you need, when you need it.

Make sure the policy covers all planned activities.

### **Emergency expenses**

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

Irish Citizens are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay. Ensure to get or renew your EHIC (formerly E111) before travel, and remember, one is needed for every person travelling.

[**Apply for your EHIC and find out more information**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/)**.**

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so check with the hospital administrator beforehand.

Accident and Emergency departments in Polish public hospitals may not accept private insurance membership cards and may require a cash payment if you cannot produce an EHIC card.

### **Registration in Poland**

Irish citizens, as EU nationals, have the right to live, work and travel in Poland freely for periods of up to three months without having to register with the Polish authorities.

However, Irish citizens who plan to spend an extended period in Poland – more than 90 days – are obliged to register with the local voivodeship office (Urząd Wojewódzki) and have a [**Certificate of registration of residence of a European Union**](https://www.gov.pl/web/mswia-en/registration-of-residence) citizen issued.
