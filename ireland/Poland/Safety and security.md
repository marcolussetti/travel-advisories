## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Poland. Pickpocketing can be a problem in public areas and on public transport, especially in crowded situations.

Do not leave drinks or food unattended and beware of accepting drinks from strangers or recent acquaintances. There have been a small number of reports of drinks being spiked in bars and night clubs.

There have been reports of large amounts of money being taken from bank cards in some bars and night clubs in Poland. Check your bill carefully and consider paying in cash. Report any suspicious activity on your bank account immediately to your bank and to police.

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Poland, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Warsaw if assistance is required.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen, the Embassy in Warsaw may be able to issue a replacement travel document for your return home.

If you believe that your passport has been stolen, we recommend that you report this theft to the police as soon as possible. A police report will be requested by the Embassy in order for a document to issue in case of theft.

Once a replacement document is issued, your missing passport will be considered cancelled. If this passport is found at a later date, it should not be used for travel.

We advise visitors to have a copy or scan of their passport information page available during their stay in case required.

### **Driving**

Irish driving licences are accepted in Poland. It is a legal requirement to carry a full driving licence, original vehicle registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers while driving.

If planning to drive in Poland, exercise caution. Some roads are in poor condition, driving can be dangerous and fatal car accidents are common. If visiting in winter, be aware that conditions for driving may be severe and your car should be equipped with winter tyres.

Be aware of Polish traffic laws. If you are not resident in Poland, you will be expected to pay fines immediately in cash in Polish currency to the police officer issuing the fine. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is strictly prohibited and is punishable by up to two years in prison.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Make sure to order a taxi from an official and reputable company. Official city taxis will have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and information about price on the window.

If ordering through a ride-share application such as Uber or Bolt, make sure that the details of the driver and car are correct before departure. Also ensure that you are familiar with the safety and emergency features available in the application.

### **Polish Roads**

From 2021, a new e-toll system has taken effect on certain national roads and motorways in Poland. All necessary information regarding this new system and actions to take before driving on Polish roads can be found in English at [**etoll.gov.pl**](https://etoll.gov.pl/en/heavy-vehicles/)
