## Additional information

### **Visas/entry stamp**

If visiting Mexico as a tourist you do not need to apply for a visa in advance, but you do need a stamped ‘Forma Migratoria Múltiple’ (FMM), which you will receive on arrival by completing an immigration form available at border crossings or on-board flights to Mexico. You need this FMM to leave the country. If you lose your FMM you can get it replaced at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico.

Irish citizens need a visa to take part in human rights activities in Mexico. Even if you only plan to undertake voluntary human rights activities during a holiday in Mexico, you should contact your nearest Mexican Embassy prior to travel in order to determine the type of visa you require.

It is no longer possible to switch immigration status in-country. You cannot enter Mexico as a tourist and then convert to a work visa. You must apply at the Mexican Embassy of your normal place of residence in plenty of time before you are due to travel.

Mexican immigration law is strictly enforced and it is essential you do not overstay the 180 day visa free period during which Irish citizens can visit Mexico for tourist or business purposes. Irish citizens are now eligible to enter Mexico for tourism purposes via the eGates immigration system at the international airports of Mexico City (Benito Juarez), Cancún, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta and San Jose del Cabo.

If travelling by land to Mexico, particularly from Guatemala, it is essential to ensure that your passport is stamped with an entry stamp. If planning to stay in Mexico for a longer period of time, it is vital to ensure you have the correct visa and that your residency status is up-to-date, or you risk being detained and deported. Detention conditions can be poor. The Embassy cannot regularise your immigration status, nor can we intervene with the Mexican authorities to prevent you from being detained in advance of deportation.

### **Passports**

The Mexican Police have the authority to ask for proof of legal status in Mexico and, on occasion, have detained EU nationals without documents. We advise to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay carry a photocopy of your passport and of the stamped ‘Forma Migratoria Múltiple’ (FMM) given to you on arrival in Mexico at all times. Your passport should be valid for 6 months from the last day of your stay in Mexico. If a resident you may be asked by the Mexican Police to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.

### **Travel between Mexico and the United States**

If flying to/from the USA and Mexico, or crossing the land border, ensure you satisfy all entry requirements. For further information on entry to the USA, consult the [**travel advice for the USA**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/united-states-of-america/). Those planning to travel are also advised to monitor the websites of the US Embassy in Dublin and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further updates and to consult your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet the US’ requirements.

### **Travel between Mexico and Guatemala**

We advise a high degree of caution at the Guatemala-Mexico land border. Disruption and closures, as well as incidents of violence, are increasingly common, so you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross. Passengers should particularly avoid crossing at night, and take extra care at walking border crossings.

### **Travelling with children**

According to the Mexican Migration Act, which came into effect in May 2011, to enter or leave the country, children under 18 years ‘must be accompanied by any of the parents or the persons exercising parental responsibility or guardianship over them...’

There is no specific requirement for authorisation by the absent parent in the case of single parents. However, if travelling with a child who is not, or who appears not to be your child (e.g. if they have a different family name) you may be asked to show a notarised authorisation signed by the parent who is not travelling with the child, or by both parents where neither is travelling with the child.

If you cannot provide this, be able to show evidence of your relationship with the child and/or the reason why you are travelling with them (e.g. a birth or adoption certificate, divorce or marriage certificates, or Parental Responsibility Order). This will minimise the risk of problems when entering or leaving Mexico.

Children under 18 years old travelling alone or accompanied by an adult who is not the parent or a legal guardian must present to the immigration officer in Mexico with a valid passport and a notarised authorisation from the parent(s) granting their permission for the child to enter/exit the country. This must be translated into Spanish.

### LGBTQIA+

The status of same-sex marriage in Mexico’s states is complex. Currently, all states have legalised same-sex marriage though homosexuality in Mexico is generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Public displays of affection between same sex couples outside of the main cities and tourist resorts in Mexico would be unusual and may attract negative attention.

### **Political activities**

The Mexican Constitution prohibits political activities by foreigners, and participation in activities such as demonstrations may result in detention and/or deportation.
