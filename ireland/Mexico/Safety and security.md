## Safety and security

Crime and violence are prevalent throughout Mexico, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Make sure to research your destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Mexico.

Armed crime and violence has been growing in tourist areas, and all visitors should exercise caution when spending time in such locations. While tourists are not usually the targets of such crimes, the growing number of gang and drug related violence in tourist areas is of serious concern, and can affect tourists directly.

The security environment in Mexico can vary significantly between states, with rates of violence and organised crime higher in certain areas.

We advise against non-essential travel to the following states, due to high levels of crime (including opportunistic crime and organised crime) and violence:

* Chiapas border areas with Guatemala
* Chihuahua
* Colima (except Manzanillo – we recommend arriving by air)
* Coahuila (except Saltillo)
* Durango (except Durango City)
* Guerrero (except the cities of Taxco, Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo, Acapulco)
* Michoacán (except Morelia)
* Jalisco (except Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta)
* Nuevo León (except Monterrey)
* Sinaloa (except Mazatlán)
* Sonora (except Hermosillo and Guaymas/San Carlos and Puerto Peñasco)
* Tabasco
* Tamaulipas
* Zacatecas (except Zacatecas City – we recommend arriving by air)

If travelling to any of the cities in these states, we recommend travelling by air.

Crime had been particularly prevalent within and around the tourist areas in Acapulco (Guerrero State) and we advise extra vigilance while travelling in and around the area.

While tourists are not generally targets of organised or drug related crime and violence, bystanders and passers-by can be affected by such incidents. Since 2017, there has been an increase in the number of reported shootings and other violent incidents in tourist areas across Mexico including incidents that have directly affected tourists.

The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations like Cancuún, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Nuevo Vallarta. If visiting any of these areas, monitor local advice, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities and your tour operator. Please note that a number of tourist areas have dedicated tourist police on call to support tourists who are victims of crime or face issues when travelling abroad.

In the centre of the country, there has been a significant increase in violence and murders in the state of Guanajuato since 2019. Violence occurs primarily in the south of the state. Criminal activity is also an issue in Mexico State (Estado de México), with continued reports of armed robbery and hijackings, as well as petty theft/crime. Organised crime is particularly prevalent in northern states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa and Durango. We recommend against non-essential travel to these states for that reason.

In the west of the country, there has been a rise in drug-related crime in the state of Baja California, including in the capital of Tijuana. There has also been a rise in drug-related crime in Baja California Sur.

Crime is also present in the East and South of the country, and citizens are encouraged to take care while travelling in all areas.

### **Drug-related Violence**

* Drug-related violence in Mexico has increased over recent years, with homicide rates peaking in 2021, though rates are still very high compared to Ireland. The violence is concentrated in certain areas. Make sure to research your destination thoroughly.
* Although tourists are not usually targeted directly, the popular tourist destinations of Acapulco, Los Cabos, Taxco, Tijuana and Zihuatenejo are now classified as amongst the most dangerous locations in Latin America due to their homicide rates. In the last number of years, incidents in the Quintana Roo and Acapulco areas, amongst others, related to drugs/criminal gangs directly affected tourists and passers-by.
* Visitors should not drive at night and should monitor media and other local sources of information about security incidents and safety risks.
* Irish visitors who consider it necessary to visit Tijuana should remain in the Zona Río and Av. Revolución areas of the city and avoid the Zonas Norte and Oriente. There are high levels of crime in Rosarito.
* Air travel should be favoured for travel to and within the northern border and Pacific states unless the safety of your preferred road route has been confirmed.

### **Demonstrations and Protests**

* Demonstrations and protests occur regularly throughout the country. Demonstrations and roadblocks are common in Mexico City (including to and from the airport) and in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Visitors should avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of the local authorities while travelling in an area where a protest is taking place.

### **Crime**

There is a high level of violent crime in Mexico. Pay close attention to your security at all times and monitor the media for information about possible new safety or security risks. Be aware that street crime is on the increase and take sensible precautions

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* In general, withdraw or exchange money at automated banking machines or bureaux de change (casas de cambio) during daylight hours only, and inside shops and malls rather than on the street. Keep credit cards in sight when paying. It is safer to limit withdrawals or currency exchanges to small sums. Check no one has followed you
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible

### **Reporting a Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Mexico, and visitors wish to report it, contact the nearest office of the Agencia del Ministerio Público (State Prosecutor’s office) as soon as possible. Complaints must be made in person, and photo identification must be presented. Please note that no criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint to the authorities.

It is especially important to report the loss or theft of your passport and any other ID (to Mexican authorities and to the Irish Embassy in Mexico), or bank cards in order to protect yourself should the documents later be misused. For emergency services, dial 911.

The emergency number in Mexico is 911. Visitors can also download the 911 CDMX app (for Mexico City) or the Guest Assist App (for Quintana Roo).

To contact Mexico City’s Tourist Police, either call them on (0052) 55 5207 4155 or whatsapp them on (0052) 55 4891 1166. The Cancún Tourist Police can be reached on +52 998 8852277

Citizens can also contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Mexico City**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/) or the [**Honorary Consulate in Cancún, Guadalajara or Monterrey**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/contact/#emergency), for assistance.

### **Kidnapping**

Kidnapping is a risk to be taken seriously, including in major cities. Victims tend to be Mexican citizens rather than foreign tourists, but basic precautions will reduce the risk of opportunistic targeting. For your own safety when travelling in Mexico, visitors should:

* Get advice from your local contacts about staying safe
* Follow advice below regarding use of taxis, including in major cities
* Be cautious and discreet about openly discussing your travel plans, and financial or business affairs
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked and windows rolled up
* Vary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns that could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

There have been incidents of ‘express kidnappings’, where people are forced to withdraw funds from ATMs to secure their release. If a victim of such an attack, visitors should comply with all the demands of the perpetrator.

Virtual kidnapping is another risk to be aware of, perpetrated by scam artists. Visitors in Mexico should avoid answering unknown or private numbers. If threatened over the phone, the recommendation is to hang up and authenticate the safety of your family member or employee.

### **Driving**

Road conditions in Mexico vary and can be poor in some areas. Dangerous curves, poorly-marked signs and construction sites, roaming livestock, slow-moving or abandoned vehicles, and other obstacles pose hazards. Illegal roadblocks have been reported, particularly in the states of Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas, with local groups seeking unofficial local tolls. If driving in these states, travel during daylight hours and use toll roads, although disruptions may still be encountered.

Mexican styles of driving and road safety standards are very different from those in Ireland so be prepared for vehicles that fail to observe speed limits or indicate lane changes and that do not stop at red lights.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Road travel should be limited to daylight hours throughout the country and where possible use toll (cuota) roads rather than free (libre) roads
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked, windows rolled up and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* There have been incidents of drug-trafficking organisations setting up vehicle ‘checkpoints’ in northern border states and Pacific states, leading to an increase in car-jackings in cities and on highways
* People who rent or borrow cars in Mexico are responsible for any illegal items found in those vehicles, even if they were unaware of their presence
* Be aware of local restrictions (for example certain limitations exist in Mexico City, where cars cannot circulate on certain days due to air pollution concerns).

### **Vehicle Emergency Assistance**

In case of a vehicle breakdown or roadside emergency, a highway patrol service offered by the Mexican Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR) called the Green Angels (Angeles Verdes) provides free assistance on all major toll highways from 8am to 8pm. The emergency number to request assistance from the Green Angels is 078.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged). Mexico City and other States can, and have, introduced restrictions on driving. Cars may be forbidden from entering certain areas on particular days, based on their number plates. Please double check any restrictions with local authorities, and/or with your car hire company directly.

### **Taxis and Public Transport**

Passengers have been robbed and/or assaulted by unlicensed taxi drivers, particularly in Mexico City. Do not hail taxis on the street. Either book taxis through Uber or similar ride-sharing applications with the appropriate security measures, hotels or by phoning a reputable taxi company, or taxi company stands (sitios) at airports, stations and other passenger hubs. At airports, use only authorised prepaid airport taxi services; official taxi company booths are located in the arrivals hall at airport terminals. It is strongly recommended not to accept water, food or sweets from taxi drivers in Mexico.

It is important to be particularly alert on public transport. When travelling on inter-state public transport, travel on first-class buses and ensure that the route uses toll roads.

If travelling in Cancún and the States of Quintana Roo and/or Yucatán, visitors should note that there have been taxi driver protests at Cancún Airport and in the hotel zone over the introduction of ride-sharing applications, which have disrupted passengers travelling to and from the airport. Further protests may arise in future.

### **Petty Theft**

Pick-pocketing is common on the Mexico City Metro. Avoid travel during the rush hour if possible. Remain vigilant on long-distance bus journeys and pay attention to your hand luggage. It is advisable to use first-class bus services and travel during daylight. Crime levels on inter-city buses and on highways are high, and the risks increase after dark.

### **Lost or Stolen passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen, please notify the [**Embassy in Mexico City**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/) to get a replacement. While most visitors should be able to request a new passport using the online system, the arrival and collection or delivery of a replacement passport can take several weeks due to time and distance factors. Please take extreme care with your passport and other personal documentation. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if a copy of the lost or stolen one can be provided, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Scams**

Be very cautious if approached by people who present themselves as police officers and try to fine or arrest you for no apparent reason. Visitors have become victims of theft, extortion or sexual assault by those who may or may not be police officers. When in doubt, ask for identification and if possible take note of the officer's name, badge number, and patrol car number. If stopped in these circumstances, try to remain in a busy area.

“Virtual kidnapping” is an increasingly common trend in Mexico. This involves criminals calling, pretending to be a distressed relative/friend/employee that has been kidnapped and explaining the kidnappers have demanded a ransom for release. If this occurs, hang up immediately and verify the safety of the individual concerned.

### **Crossing the US-Mexico Border**

Visitors should travel to Mexico by air to avoid international land border crossings, particularly along the border with the United States, in the following cities:

* Ciudad Juárez
* Nuevo Laredo
* Reynosa

If crossing an international land border:

* remain extremely vigilant
* use only official border crossings
* avoid travelling at night

Students in the US on J1 visas are strongly advised against leaving and re-entering the United States during their J1, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. Students have encountered particular difficulties crossing the US-Mexico border, which has sometimes led to deportation and an end to their J1 visa. This will permanently impact your ability to travel to the US in the future. Participants in a J1 programme must also ensure that their sponsor permits temporary travel outside the United States while on a J1 programme.

If you travel to Mexico and lose your passport here, you may be in real difficulty – immigration controls have tightened considerably and you will not be allowed re-enter the US without a valid machine readable passport. There is no Irish Consulate in Tijuana and Mexico City is a 3 hour flight away. Irish citizens who travel outside the US while participating in a J1 programme should expect to be subject to standard immigration procedures on re-entering the US.

There have been reports of kidnappings, muggings, and drink-spiking of people crossing from the US into Mexico – particularly the city of Tijuana. This type of crime appears to be increasing, be extremely careful and avoid putting yourself in vulnerable situations. Be aware that alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Mexico is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.
