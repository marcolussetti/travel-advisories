### **Travel Alert**

Protests are ongoing in Mexico City and have blocked access to both terminals of Mexico City’s main airport (AICM) for a prolonged period on 22 and 23 May. Media reports indicate that protests may continue over the weekend of 24 and 25 May. There may be flight disruptions or cancellations. Transport links to and from the airport may face significant disruption and reaching the airport will take longer than usual. If you have a flight from or to Mexico City you should allow extra time to reach the airport, monitor local media and stay in touch with your airline or tour operator.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Mexico.

A valid passport is required for travel to Mexico. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Irish citizens are now eligible to enter Mexico for tourism purposes via the eGates immigration system at the international airports of Mexico City (Benito Juarez), Cancún, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta and San Jose del Cabo.

Permission to enter the country is at the discretion of Mexico’s Immigration Authorities, who can grant stays up to a maximum of 180 days. This is not granted automatically, so visitors should be prepared to provide evidence of their travel plans relevant to the amount of days they hope to be granted. Visitors should check the stamp in their passport to see how many days they have been granted, and abide by this amount.

Make sure to carry ID and relevant immigration documents at all times. The authorities carry out regular checks across the country, particularly on buses, and any overstay can result in detention at an immigration facility while they investigate, with the risk of being deported. Please note that the Embassy cannot intervene in the application of Mexican law.

For more information on visas and passports, as well as migration via air and land entry points, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Mexico should take out a comprehensive insurance policy to cover the cost of any medical care, including repatriation.

Mexican facilities often require payment “up front” before providing medical care, including emergency procedures. Not all hospitals will agree to deal directly with medical insurance companies and **visitors should be prepared to pay for treatment up front and then seek a refund from their health insurance provider.**

Crime and violence are prevalent throughout Mexico, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Visitors should therefore make sure to research their destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Mexico. While tourists are not usually the targets of armed crime and violence, the growing number of gang and drug related violence in tourist areas is of serious concern, and can affect tourists directly. All visitors should exercise caution when spending time in such locations. For further information on security, safety and crime in Mexico, please consult the Safety and Security section of our travel advice.

Visitors to Mexico are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media X [**@IrishEmbMexico**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbMexico?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Assisted human reproduction** (**surrogacy)**

Mexico is a federal country, with 32 states. There is no national law on assisted human reproduction or surrogacy, and regulations differ by state. The Department of Foreign Affairs urges caution in respect of undertaking a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico. Irish citizens should obtain independent and comprehensive legal advice before entering into any arrangement and should anticipate potential delays and other complications in securing the necessary paperwork to leave Mexican jurisdiction with a baby born by surrogacy. The Department also advises intending parents to prepare to remain in the country for up to three months after the birth of a baby by surrogacy.

### **Emergency Assistance**

In the event of a problem, we advise to seek a solution via local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management in the first instance.

Visitors can contact emergency services in Mexico by dialling 911.

In case of a vehicle breakdown or roadside emergency, a highway patrol service offered by the Mexican Ministry of Tourism (SECTUR) called the Green Angels (Angeles Verdes) provides free assistance on all major toll highways from 8am to 8pm. The emergency number to request assistance from the Green Angels is 078.
