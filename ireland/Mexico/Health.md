### **Local Health Providers**

All visitors to Mexico should take out a comprehensive insurance policy to cover the cost of all medical eventualities, up to and including repatriation.

Not all hospitals will agree to deal directly with medical insurance companies however, and may insist on payment “up front” from the patient, friend, or family member. Visitors should be prepared to pay for treatment in advance and then seek a refund from their health insurance provider. If visitors require treatment or surgery, please contact your medical assistance/health insurance provider promptly to identify healthcare providers in the country, and clear any possible costs in advance of payment.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are needed for Mexico.

Malaria and dengue fever are endemic in low-lying rural areas of Mexico and outbreaks can occur throughout the year.

Mosquito repellent and clothing covering as much skin as possible provides some protection.
