## Natural disasters and climate

### **Hurricane Season**

The hurricane season in Mexico extends from June to the end of November and can severely disrupt transportation and utilities. Landslides, mudslides and flooding may occur. In the case of a hurricane, monitor local media reports and follow the instructions of local emergency officials. Visitors should also monitor local and international weather updates for the region and check the [**Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/) or the [**National Hurricane Centre**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) in Miami.

If in Mexico during the hurricane season, you should leave a detailed copy of your travel plans with a family member or friend. Register with the Irish Embassy in Mexico City. In the event of an approaching hurricane, identify your local shelter. Flights in and out of affected areas could be delayed or suspended and available flights may fill quickly so contact your airline for the latest flight information.

The hurricane could also affect access to sea ports in the region. In some areas, adequate shelter from a severe hurricane may not be available to all who may choose to stay. Familiarise yourself with your hotel or cruise ship evacuation plans. Carry your travel documents at all times (i.e. passport, picture identification, etc.) or secure them in a safe, waterproof location. You should also contact friends and family in Ireland with updates about your welfare and whereabouts.

### **Earthquakes**

Mexico is in an active earthquake zone and is subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Tremors occur regularly, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero; these tremors can sometimes be felt in other parts of the country, including in Mexico City. If travelling to or living in Mexico, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake. If travelling to Mexico City, visitors can download the 911 CDMX app. This app warns of an earthquake approximately 60 seconds in advance. Note that alarms cannot always detect earthquakes in advance.

### **Volcanoes**

There are several active volcanoes in Mexico, including the Popocatepetl and Colima volcanoes. Be aware that volcanic ash can cause serious disruption to travel services.
