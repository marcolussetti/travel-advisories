## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Immigration**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Mexico, but must ensure they satisfy the immigration entry requirements, available [**here**](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/irlanda/index.php/services/visas). Permission to enter the country is at the discretion of Mexico’s Immigration Authorities.

Please note that the maximum stay for tourism purposes is 180 days, but this maximum is not granted by default. **If seeking the maximum number of days (180), you may be required to explain the purpose of your trip to the immigration official as well as provide evidence to support your claim (accommodations, funds, return flight, etc.)**

Mexico has implemented a new system for recording entry to the country – a passport stamp indicating the number of days that you are allowed to stay in the country. If you require a digital version, you can obtain it online in advance from the National Institute of Immigration (INM) website. Irish citizens are now eligible to enter Mexico for tourism purposes via the eGates immigration system at the international airports of Mexico City (Benito Juarez), Cancún, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta and San Jose del Cabo.

To leave the country, you will have to present your passport with the stamp showing the number of days granted. If you lose your passport, you will need to pay a fee to replace the entry stamp. You can also pay this fee at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico (please note INM or immigration officers do not accept cash payments).

Visitors should be aware that implementation of this system can vary across the country, so if you are required to complete an immigration form, Forma Migratoria Múltiple (FMM), form which is then stamped by the immigration official, please keep this paper with you at all times until departure from the country.

Visitors with any form of visa or residence in the country should proactively present this, as incorrectly being registered as a tourist on the system may void or reset your status.

Please note that you will not be able to request an extension or change the condition of your stay from inside the country, and overstays can result in detention and/or deportation.

The Mexican Police have the authority to ask for proof of legal status in Mexico. Carry your passport, as well as your stamped immigration form (FMM) if received upon arrival to Mexico at all times. If a resident, you may be asked to provide your residency card issued by the Mexican government.

If unable to produce these documents, you may be detained held at an immigration-holding centre, and ultimately deported.

Visitors should be aware that spot-checks are frequent, particularly in the south of the country, and Irish citizens have been held in detention centres for a few days until their immigration status could be clarified.

If detained, you can ask the detention centre to notify the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico City, and request consular assistance. Please be aware that the majority of immigration authorities can only be contacted during office hours Monday-Friday.

### **Illegal drugs**

Do not get involved with drugs of any kind in any way. Penalties for drug offences are severe. Convictions carry very long sentences – up to 25 years.

### **Public order offences**

Drinking alcohol in public places is strictly prohibited.

### **LGBTQIA+**

The status of same-sex marriage in Mexico’s states is complex. Currently, all states have legalised same-sex marriage though homosexuality in Mexico is generally tolerated, rather than accepted. Public displays of affection between same sex couples outside of the main cities and tourist resorts in Mexico would be unusual and may attract negative attention.

Assisted human reproduction (surrogacy): Mexico is a federal country, with 32 states. There is no national law on assisted human reproduction or surrogacy, and regulations differ by state. The Department of Foreign Affairs urges caution in respect of undertaking a surrogacy arrangement in Mexico. Irish citizens should obtain independent and comprehensive legal advice before entering into any arrangement and should anticipate potential delays and other complications in securing the necessary paperwork to leave Mexican jurisdiction with a baby born by surrogacy. The Department also advises intending parents to prepare to remain in the country for up to three months after the birth of a baby by surrogacy.
