## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is an increased risk of terrorism in the northern regions along the border with Burkina Faso and Niger. We advise against all travel to this region, including Parc du W, the hunting zones of Mékrou and Djona, Pendjari National Park and areas within 5km of the Burkinabé border.

### **Political Situation**

The situation remains volatile after violent protests related to the legislative elections which took place in April 2019. We suggest to exercise caution and avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations.

### **Practical advice**

* Get advice locally about areas of risk and security concerns
* Take common-sense precautions about safety and security
* Know who to contact in case of an emergency
