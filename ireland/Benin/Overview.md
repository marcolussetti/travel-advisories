High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

There is an increased risk of terrorism in the northern regions along the border with Burkina Faso and Niger. We advise against all travel to this region, including Parc du W, the hunting zones of Mékrou and Djona, Pendjari National Park and areas within 5km of the Burkinabé border.

We advise against all but essential travel to the area between the Interstate Highway (RNIE) 2 from Tchaourou to Malanville and the Benin-Nigeria border, due to increasing criminality.

Irish citizens should exercise caution and avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Benin. Further information on how to apply for a visa can be found on the Government of Benin’s [**eVisa platform**](https://evisa.bj/).

Visitors to Benin are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Nigeria on social media ([**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbNigeria) and [**Facebook)**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandnigeria/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Benin by dialling 117.
