### Travel Alert

General elections took place in Tanzania on 29 October 2025. There have been several days of country-wide unrest and outbreaks of violence. During this time, there was an internet blackout, which severely disrupted communications.

The situation in Tanzania is currently calm and the internet has been restored. There remains a heightened presence of security forces, including military and police checkpoints, in some areas of the country.

Irish citizens are advised to:

- Stay alert to your surroundings

- Carry ID at all times

- Plan travel routes in advance

- Avoid all protests, demonstrations, rallies or crowds

- Monitor local media for updates on the situation within the country

- Follow the advice of the local authorities

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. [**Apply for an e-visa**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before you travel. It is possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. Passengers may be asked to provide proof of their return journey at Tanzanian immigration.

If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will also need a work permit. Your employer or volunteer organisation should help you arrange this before you travel. If you overstay your visa or permit you risk arrest, detention, a fine and deportation. More information on volunteering in Tanzania is available under the Local laws and customs tab below.

For further information about visas, visit the [**Tanzanian immigration website**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) or contact the [**Tanzanian High Commission in London**](https://uk.tzembassy.go.tz/)

A valid passport is required for travel to Tanzania. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry and a minimum on one unused visa page. Passport cards cannot be used.

From 1 October 2024, all foreigners entering Zanzibar will be required to purchase mandatory travel insurance directly from the national insurer, Zanzibar Insurance Corporation. For more information please visit [**https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/**](https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/).

Visitors to Tanzania are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The EU has included all Tanzanian air carriers on the EU Air Safety List, which means Tanzanian air carriers are currently not authorised to fly within European airspace.
