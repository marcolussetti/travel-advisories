Travellers are advised that on 21 March 2025 the US Embassy in Tanzania issued a [Travel Advisory](https://tz.usembassy.gov/security-alert-u-s-embassy-dar-es-salaam-tanzania-march-21-2025/) to avoid travel to islands and coastal areas south of Kisiju, Tanzania.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. [Apply for an e-visa](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before you travel. It is possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. Passengers may be asked to provide proof of their return journey at Tanzanian immigration .

If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will also need a work permit. Your employer or volunteer organisation should help you arrange this before you travel. If you overstay your visa or permit you risk arrest, detention, a fine and deportation. More information on volunteering in Tanzania is available under the additional information tab below.

For further information about visas, visit the [**Tanzanian immigration website**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) or contact the [**Tanzanian High Commission in London**](https://tzhc.uk/).

A valid passport is required for travel to Tanzania. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry and a minimum on one unused visa page. Passport cards cannot be used.

From 1 October 2024, all foreigners entering Zanzibar will be required to purchase mandatory travel insurance directly from the national insurer, Zanzibar Insurance Corporation. For more information please visit [**https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/**](https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/).

Visitors to Tanzania are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The EU announced on 13 December 2024 that they were including Air Tanzania on the EU Air Safety List, which means the airline is currently not authorised to fly within the European Union.
