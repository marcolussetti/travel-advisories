## Additional information

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Tanzania. The current charge for a tourist visa for Irish citizens is US$50. [Apply for an e-visa](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before you travel. It is possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. Passengers may be asked to provide proof of their return journey. Passports should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your visa application.

For further information about visas and permits, visit the [**Tanzanian immigration website**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) or contact the [**Tanzanian High Commission in London**](https://tzhc.uk/).

If planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel. A separate permit is required if you intend to engage in journalism whilst in Tanzania.

If you overstay your visa or permit you risk arrest, detention, a fine and deportation.

### **Passports**

Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry into Tanzania and at least one unused visa page.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Tanzania and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, you are advised to [**apply for a new passport online**](https://passportonline.dfa.ie/Apply/Passport) if [**current turnaround times**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) allow. If you need to travel urgently we can help by issuing a single use emergency travel document that will get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have a Consulate in Zanzibar there may be additional complications in processing an application for a single use emergency travel document.

Please [**contact**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/tanzania/daressalaam/contact/) the Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam for information on emergency travel documents and to be advised on the fees which apply.

### **Money**

The Tanzanian Shilling is the official currency of Tanzania. Most banks in major cities have ATMs, but they are not always reliable and sometimes break down or run out of money. To minimise the risk of card cloning, only use ATMs located within the bank. Travellers’ cheques are not widely accepted.

### **Volunteering**

If you intend to volunteer with or visit orphanages in Tanzania, it is advisable to do due diligence on the organisation that you are visiting before travelling, including ensuring they have an appropriate child protection policy in place, in order to avoid any risk of exposure of abuse and exploitation of the children. You are also advised to visit the following website: Comhlámh’s [Code of Good Practice](https://comhlamh.org/code-of-good-practice/) for advice on responsible international volunteering.

When volunteering abroad, you should follow the same advice as any traveller. You may need a work visa, health vaccinations, or minimum passport validity. Travel insurance is still considered essential. Even though you may stay in a single location, you should ensure that your family or friends at home have a copy of your itinerary and your travel documents. You should also attempt to maintain contact with relative frequency.

You can register your travel plans with the Department through the [Citizens Registration facility](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/)**.**

As many volunteering experiences involve spending time in rural areas, consider basic language training and familiarise yourself with local customs. This may help you to find useful information and improve your immersion experience.

### **Climate**

Tanzania has a tropical climate.

### **Earthquake**

Tanzania lies on a fault line (Rift Valley fault) and earthquakes can occur. The last significant earthquake (magnitude 5.7) happened on 10 September 2016 in the Kagera region, North West Tanzania. If travelling to or living in Tanzania, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Tsunami**

In the areas bordering the Indian Ocean there is a risk of tsunamis but these usually occur in deep sea waters and warnings are usually issued in advance.

### **Flooding**

The main rainy season extends from March to May in Tanzania, with a shorter, lighter rainy season in November and December. If travelling to Tanzania, monitor local weather forecasts and know what to expect. In the districts of the larger cities with a high density of informal settlements there is a risk of severe flooding in low-lying areas during the rainy season.

### **Prohibition on plastic bags**

All plastic carrier bags have been prohibited from being imported, exported, manufactured, sold, stored, supplied and used in mainland Tanzania.

Plastic or plastic packaging for medical services, industrial products, foodstuffs, sanitary and waste management, and for use in the construction industry and agricultural sector are not prohibited.

Visitors to Tanzania are advised to avoid carrying plastic carrier bags, or packing plastic carrier bags or items in plastic carrier bags in their suitcase or hand luggage before embarking on a visit to Tanzania. Visitors may be asked to surrender plastic carrier bags at entry points.

Plastic carrier items known as “Ziploc bags” that are specifically used to carry toiletries will be permitted, as they are expected to remain in the permanent possession of visitors and are not expected to be disposed of in the country.
