## Local laws and customs

Tanzanians are welcoming and well disposed towards visitors, but be sensitive to local culture. Loud or aggressive behaviour, drunkenness, foul language and disrespect, especially towards older people, will cause offence.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Be conscious of your dress and behaviour if you intend to visit places of worship and take care not to offend local culture or religious beliefs, especially during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. Guide books, local hoteliers and tour guides can be good sources of information for how to behave and dress respectfully.

Consider dressing modestly when in public. Women should avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless tops away from tourist resorts and in Stone Town in Zanzibar.

Zanzibari authorities may fine tourists, guides and tour operators for inappropriate clothing worn in public. Fines for tourists are a minimum of 700 USD, and tour operators face a minimum fine of 1000 USD.

### **LGBT Travellers**

Homosexual activity is illegal in Tanzania, including Zanzibar. Public displays of affection between persons of the same sex may be met with arrest, harassment or violence.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Animal Products**

There are criminal laws on the protection of wildlife and fauna in Tanzania. Avoid bringing wildlife products such as jewellery into Tanzania as you risk delay, questioning or detention when trying to leave the country.

It is illegal to export an animal or animal part (including live or dead animal parts, such as skins and bones, feathers, or shells), whether purchased or received as a gift, without export certification from the government. It is also illegal to gather, collect, or remove any flora or fauna, including seashells, from marine parks. Penalties include fines and/or imprisonment.

### **Money**

The Tanzanian Shilling is the official currency of Tanzania. Most banks in major cities have ATMs, but they are not always reliable and sometimes break down or run out of money. To minimise the risk of card cloning, only use ATMs located within the bank. Travellers’ cheques are not widely accepted.

### **Volunteering**

If you intend to volunteer with or visit orphanages in Tanzania, it is advisable to do due diligence on the organisation that you are visiting before travelling, including ensuring they have an appropriate child protection policy in place, in order to avoid any risk of exposure of abuse and exploitation of the children. You are also advised to visit the following website: Comhlámh’s [**Code of Good Practice**](https://comhlamh.org/code-of-good-practice/) for advice on responsible international volunteering.

When volunteering abroad, you should follow the same advice as any traveller. You may need a work visa, health vaccinations, or minimum passport validity. Travel insurance is still considered essential. Even though you may stay in a single location, you should ensure that your family or friends at home have a copy of your itinerary and your travel documents. You should also attempt to maintain contact with relative frequency.

You can register your travel plans with the Department through the [**Citizens Registration facility**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/)**.**

As many volunteering experiences involve spending time in rural areas, consider basic language training and familiarise yourself with local customs. This may help you to find useful information and improve your immersion experience.
