### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

From 1 October 2024, all foreigners entering Zanzibar will be required to purchase mandatory travel insurance directly from the national insurer, Zanzibar Insurance Corporation. For more information please visit [**https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/**](https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/).

On 14 January 2025, [**WHO informed member states of an outbreak of suspected Marburg disease in the Kagera region of northwest Tanzania**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552). Investigations are ongoing to determine the full scope of the outbreak. Travellers to the area are advised to take extra precautions, read relevant [**WHO guidance**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552), monitor developments regularly and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We can not advise on vaccinations, please get information from a GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

A Yellow Fever vaccination certificate is required for all travellers arriving from, or having transited through countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission, and will be inspected on arrival in Tanzania. Visitors may also be required to provide a yellow fever certificate on arrival in Zanzibar, even if you travel there from the Tanzanian mainland, regardless of the country originally travelled to Tanzania from. Travelers with neither the vaccination nor an exemption letter are typically allowed entry and directed to a health officer to obtain the shot.

### **Medical Care in Tanzania**

Quality medical care services are limited, especially outside Dar es Salaam and other major urban centres. Medical help at the scene of an accident is also likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Adequate insurance can be crucial in helping people get the medical attention required.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case your medication is lost.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is common in Tanzania and is transmitted by mosquitoes. You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria can be contracted throughout the year and anywhere in Tanzania, including in Dar es Salaam. It is highly advisable to take precautions:

* Avoid mosquito bites by covering up with clothing such as long sleeves and long trousers, especially after sunset, using insect repellents on exposed skin and sleeping under a mosquito net.
* Check with a doctor or nurse about how to prevent malaria before traveling.
* If you develop a fever while in Tanzania, you are advised to seek medical attention promptly
* If travelling to high risk malarious areas, remote from medical facilities, carrying emergency malaria standby treatment should be seriously considered.

### **Water**

Water quality can be poor in Tanzania and outbreaks of waterborne diseases can occur. Ensure that drinking water is safe before consumption.
