## Entry requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Tanzania. The current charge for a tourist visa for Irish citizens is US$50. [**Apply for an e-visa**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before you travel. It is possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. Passengers may be asked to provide proof of their return journey. Passports should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your visa application.

For further information about visas and permits, visit the [**Tanzanian immigration website**](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) or contact the [**Tanzanian High Commission in London**](https://tzhc.uk/).

If planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel. A separate permit is required if you intend to engage in journalism whilst in Tanzania.

If you overstay your visa or permit you risk arrest, detention, a fine and deportation.

### **Passports**

Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the date of entry into Tanzania and at least one unused visa page.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Tanzania and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, you are advised to [**apply for a new passport online**](https://passportonline.dfa.ie/Apply/Passport) if [**current turnaround times**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/turnaround-times/) allow. If you need to travel urgently we can help by issuing a single use emergency travel document that will get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have a Consulate in Zanzibar there may be additional complications in processing an application for a single use emergency travel document.

Please [**contact**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/tanzania/daressalaam/contact/) the Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam for information on emergency travel documents and to be advised on the fees which apply.
