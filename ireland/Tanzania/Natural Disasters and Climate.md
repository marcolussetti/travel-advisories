## Natural Disasters and Climate

### **Climate**

Tanzania has a tropical climate.

### **Earthquake**

Tanzania lies on a fault line (Rift Valley fault) and earthquakes can occur. The last significant earthquake (magnitude 5.7) happened on 10 September 2016 in the Kagera region, North West Tanzania. If travelling to or living in Tanzania, make sure you know what to do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Tsunami**

In the areas bordering the Indian Ocean there is a risk of tsunamis but these usually occur in deep sea waters and warnings are usually issued in advance.

### **Flooding**

The main rainy season extends from March to May in Tanzania, with a shorter, lighter rainy season in November and December. If travelling to Tanzania, monitor local weather forecasts and know what to expect. In the districts of the larger cities with a high density of informal settlements there is a risk of severe flooding in low-lying areas during the rainy season.

### **Prohibition on Plastic Bags**

All plastic carrier bags have been prohibited from being imported, exported, manufactured, sold, stored, supplied and used in mainland Tanzania.

Plastic or plastic packaging for medical services, industrial products, foodstuffs, sanitary and waste management, and for use in the construction industry and agricultural sector are not prohibited.

Visitors to Tanzania are advised to avoid carrying plastic carrier bags, or packing plastic carrier bags or items in plastic carrier bags in their suitcase or hand luggage before embarking on a visit to Tanzania. Visitors may be asked to surrender plastic carrier bags at entry points.

Plastic carrier items known as “Ziploc bags” that are specifically used to carry toiletries will be permitted, as they are expected to remain in the permanent possession of visitors and are not expected to be disposed of in the country.
