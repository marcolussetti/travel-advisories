## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations you need for Uzbekistan.

### **Medical facilities**

The quality of medical care is generally poor and you should avoid all but basic treatment or essential treatment in the event of an emergency. Comprehensive medical insurance, including evacuation by air ambulance, is essential.

### **Malaria**

Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. When you arrive, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Other Illnesses**

Outbreaks of hepatitis A, meningitis and diphtheria have occurred in Uzbekistan. Cases of polio have been reported in border areas and tuberculosis is also a concern.

### **Food Hygiene**

Peel fruit and vegetables, avoid undercooked meat, unpasteurised dairy products and most of the food sold on the streets.

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled or bottled water during your stay, and avoid ice in drinks.
