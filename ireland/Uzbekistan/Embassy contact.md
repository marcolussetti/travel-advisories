## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Uzbekistan, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Moscow.**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/)

The Embassy operates an out-of-hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance. If you are in need of emergency assistance, please ring the Embassy Duty Officer at +7 985 928 7615
