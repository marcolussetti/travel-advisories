## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Uzbekistan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the [**Embassy of Uzbekistan**](http://www.uzembassy.uk/) in London.

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

If you want to travel to Termez and other parts of the Surkhandarya region, you’ll need to apply for a permit from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tashkent.

### **Passports**

You should carry your passport with you at all times as this is a legal requirement in Uzbekistan. The police often carry out checks. Make sure you fill in the next of kin details in the back pages.

### **Customs**

Foreigners must complete a Customs Declaration in duplicate on entering Uzbekistan. Customs officials will review and stamp both copies. One will be retained by the Customs Authority, you keep the other and present it when you leave the country.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations you need for Uzbekistan.

### **Medical facilities**

The quality of medical care is generally poor and you should avoid all but basic treatment or essential treatment in the event of an emergency. Comprehensive medical insurance, including evacuation by air ambulance, is essential.

### **Malaria**

Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. When you arrive, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Other illnesses**

Outbreaks of hepatitis A, meningitis and diphtheria have occurred in Uzbekistan. Cases of polio have been reported in border areas and tuberculosis is also a concern.

### **Food hygiene**

Peel fruit and vegetables, avoid undercooked meat, unpasteurised dairy products and most of the food sold on the streets.

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled or bottled water during your stay, and avoid ice in drinks.

### **Money**

Bring enough money for the duration of your stay and only change money through official exchange booths. You will need to complete a foreign-currency declaration form when you arrive, and keep a copy yourself. You cannot leave with more foreign currency than you arrived with. ATMs are uncommon in Uzbekistan and the use of credit cards is rare outside of high-end restaurants and hotels in Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara.
