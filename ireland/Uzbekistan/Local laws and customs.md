## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

You should carry your passport with you at all times as this is a legal requirement in Uzbekistan. The police often carry out checks.

### **Illegal drugs**

The possession of certain drugs is illegal and prison sentences can be lengthy.

### **Prescribed Medication**

Bring a doctor’s prescription with you if you intend to travel with prescription medicine and declare the items on your Customs Declaration Form. If you don’t declare these items or if you’re carrying more than the legal limit, you could face administrative or even criminal proceedings, even if you have a doctor’s prescription. Information on prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed to be imported can be found on the website of the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality is illegal under Uzbek law. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

While photography in public places is generally permitted, you should check before using a camera, especially near airports, military barracks and police stations.

### **Money**

Bring enough money for the duration of your stay and only change money through official exchange booths. You will need to complete a foreign-currency declaration form when you arrive, and keep a copy yourself. You cannot leave with more foreign currency than you arrived with. ATMs are uncommon in Uzbekistan and the use of credit cards is rare outside of high-end restaurants and hotels in Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara.
