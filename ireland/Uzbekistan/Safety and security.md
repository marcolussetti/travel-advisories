## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Care should be taken when travelling to areas bordering Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan other than via authorised crossing points. Security incidents have been reported from border areas and some areas are mined. Particular care should be taken if you are travelling in the Fergana Valley.

### **Demonstrations**

Avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings. Always keep yourself informed of what’s going on by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Terrorist attacks in Uzbekistan cannot be ruled out. You should be particularly vigilant in public places and pay attention to any security announcements by the Uzbek authorities. The Uzbek government has occasionally restricted travel to certain parts of the country in response to security concerns.

### **Crime**

Crime is not a serious problem in Uzbekistan. However, there have been occasional muggings and petty crime against foreigners so you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Avoid obvious displays of wealth, especially in rural areas
* You should carry your passport with you at all times as this is a legal requirement in Uzbekistan. The police often carry out checks.
* Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car

### **Police Officers**

There have been allegations of crimes by off-duty policemen or those pretending to be policemen. Genuine police officials should always present their own credentials when asking someone for proof of their identity. If you’re in doubt, go to the nearest police station.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If you lose your passport, report it immediately to the police and get confirmation of the loss in writing. You’ll need this when applying for an emergency passport from the [**Irish Embassy in Moscow.**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/)  The Embassy can accept applications for new passports, which may take between four and six weeks to be processed in Dublin, but new full passports cannot be issued in Moscow.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Uzbekistan, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Moscow**](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/russia/contact-us/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Uzbekistan, take care – many roads are poor and badly lit.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and your  international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* There is a zero tolerance policy towards those driving under the influence of alcohol
* You drive on the right in Uzbekistan and vehicles approaching a roundabout have a right of way over those already on it

### **Road Safety**

There are security checkpoints at the city limits of Tashkent and other towns throughout the country so you may experience delays if you travel by car.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public Transport**

In Tashkent it is safer to use official taxis and to travel in modern vehicles. We don’t encourage the hiring of private unlicensed hackney cabs instead of licensed taxis.

Many buses and taxis run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and safety regulations are not always followed. Where possible, you should choose modern vehicles when travelling by bus or taxi.

### **Air Safety**

If you intend to travel to, from or within Uzbekistan, avoid flying on [**airlines listed under the EU operating ban**](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban_en). It is not known if maintenance regulations are properly observed with aircraft used for internal flights. Where possible, use a direct flight originating from outside Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
