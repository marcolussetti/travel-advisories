## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

You must have a valid machine readable Irish passport when entering and leaving Slovakia and you must carry your passport with you at all times as identification. Keep it safe and keep the details separately in case you lose it.  If you’re a tourist or short-term visitor, we recommend that you should also leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
