## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Slovakia. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are required by law to register your presence with the nearest Foreign Police Department. For more details, please refer to [**Residence of Union Citizens**](https://www.slovensko.sk/en/life-situation/life-situation/_residence-of-union-citizens-an/).

### Passport

You must have a valid machine readable Irish passport when entering and leaving Slovakia and you must carry your passport with you at all times as identification. Keep it safe and keep the details separately in case you lose it.  If you’re a tourist or short-term visitor, we recommend that you should also leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
