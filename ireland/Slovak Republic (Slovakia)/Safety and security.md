## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Slovakia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Slovakia but you should take sensible precautions. Particular care should be taken in crowded places such as nightclubs, bars and cafes.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* You must carry your passport with you at all times as identification. Keep it safe in a zipped up pocket or secure bag, and keep the details separately in case you lose it.  You should also leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Be aware that groups of tourists may be tempting to pickpockets so ensure that your valuables are stored securely. Storing passports or wallets in pockets or in other places where they can be seen could make you a target. You should be particularly cautious at airports, bus stations and train stations but also in pubs, nightclubs and restaurants as these are the locations most frequently targeted by pick pockets;
* If you are planning to go to a night club, be aware that even very safe cities can become dangerous at night. Not all night clubs are well run. Some bouncers have been known to put whole groups out on the street at the first sign of any trouble and this could expose you to the risk of being set upon even if you are an innocent bystander. If you see any trouble, whether or not it involves you or your friends, put your own safety first and leave immediately.
* Reports of cards being used to obtain money fraudulently are not unknown. Protect yourself by ensuring that your card is within your sight at all times and your PIN number is hidden. If you are told that a payment was not authorised, ask for the receipt and check that this is actually the case, do not continue to authorise payments using the same card and code as you may be inadvertently authorising multiple payments.
* If you are staying in a shared room in a hostel, make sure that your valuables are secured in a safe. There have been cases where tourists have awoken to discover that they have been robbed of their passports, money and other valuables overnight.
* Make sure that the taxi company you are using is reputable. You can ask hotels or other accommodation providers to call you a taxi from a reputable company or alternatively, you can do an internet search to find numbers of well-established English speaking taxi companies operating locally that you can call to bring you to your destination. In Bratislava, calling a taxi from a reputable company is not only safer but also less expensive than hailing a taxi on the street.
* When travelling on buses and trains, check whether you must validate your ticket. If validation is required, failure to do so will result in substantial fines and no exceptions will be made for foreigners;
* Be aware that drinking on the street is forbidden in Bratislava except in clearly delineated areas such as terraces during the summer. Noise is also forbidden in Bratislava after 10pm. The Slovak Police will not hesitate to impose penalties on supporters who break the law.
* If you decide to go to a party, do not go alone and make sure that you know where you will be and that you have the means to get home independently and safely.

### **Reporting a crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Slovakia, report it to the local police immediately. The number for emergency services in Slovakia is 112. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Bratislava**](/en/slovak-republic/bratislava/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

The roads in Slovakia are modern and well maintained. If you are intending to drive, make sure that you are fully acquainted with the rules of the road as well as mandatory vehicle equipment and maintenance requirements such as winter tyres.

If you are planning to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. The drink/driving limit in Slovakia is zero
* Particular care should be taken on secondary roads which may not be cleared of snow and ice in winter

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
