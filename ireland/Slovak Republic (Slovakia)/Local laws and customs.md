## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Personal identification**

You should carry your passport or passport card at all times as identification so we advise you to keep a separate photocopy of your passport and other ID in case you lose it.

### **Public Transport**

When using public transport, particularly buses or trams, tickets must be validated immediately upon entering the bus or tram. Failure to do so can attract on the spot fines of €50 and inspectors will insist that the fine is paid irrespective of the circumstances.

### **Alcohol**

Drinking alcohol in unapproved public places such as squares and parks is prohibited in the Old Town area of Bratislava. There may be exceptions for seasonal markets (such as the Christmas Market) and outside seating areas of restaurants and bars.  But consuming alcohol (for example bought in a supermarket) in other public areas could lead to a fine of €33.

### **Antisocial behaviour**

Making excessive noise between 10pm and 6am is against the law. Rowdy behaviour could attract the attention of the police. Bratislava has become a popular destination for stag parties and tourists have been fined or imprisoned for causing a public nuisance.

### **Illegal drugs**

Do not get involved with drugs in any way. The penalties for smuggling, possession and use of drugs are severe.
