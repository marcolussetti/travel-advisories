## Entry requirements

### **Visas**

Citizens can travel to Kazakhstan without a visa, provided stay does not exceed 30 days (the day of arrival counts as day 1, regardless of arrival time). If citizens wish to stay longer than 30 days, visa is required.

Citizens should ensure to have the correct visa for the purpose of travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of visa and any associated restrictions carefully before travel.

If citizens violate the conditions of a visa, they could face a short term of imprisonment and/or a ban on entry to Kazakhstan for up to 5 years. Overstaying the date written on a white immigration card may result in similar penalties, regardless of the validity of a visa.

For more information on entry requirements for Kazakhstan, please contact the [**Embassy of Kazakhstan in London**](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/mfa-london?lang=en).

### **Passports**

Visitors must have their passport at all times in Kazakhstan as well as the migration card received when entering the country. Genuine police officials should always present their own credentials when asking for proof of identity

### **Immigration Cards**

At airports and border posts, Kazakhstani immigration officials will present visitors with a white immigration card. Visitors must keep this card while travelling in Kazakhstan and present it at the airport/border posts when departing.

### **Crossing the Border**

We advise not to cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally as the absence of entry/exit stamps will cause problems (e.g. possible detention, fines) when leaving or re-entering the country.
