## Local laws and customs

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors must have passports at all times in Kazakhstan as well as migration card received when entering the country. Genuine police officials should always present their own credentials when asking for proof of identity.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photography**

There are some restrictions on photography near military establishments, border areas and some official buildings. There are sometimes notices on display about these restrictions, but this is not always the case, so be cautious.

### **LGBT**

Although homosexuality is not illegal in Kazakhstan, it is often not condoned or tolerated, especially outside the major cities. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Customs**

We strongly advise all valuables be declared on entry in order to avoid paying duty on those items when departing Kazakhstan.

### **Money**

Most hotels, restaurants and larger shops accept credit cards, but smaller shops and taxi drivers do not. ATMs exist in most major cities but visitors should bring enough money for the duration of the trip. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not normally accepted.

### **Currency**

The tenge is the unit of currency in Kazakhstan. If visitors wish to buy tenge in Kazakhstan, we advise to take Euro or US dollars to change (US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency). All notes should be in good condition.

Only change money at banks, hotels and recognised exchange kiosks - it is an offence to change money from street traders. Bring your passport and visa, as they will need to be shown when changing money.
