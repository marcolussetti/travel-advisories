## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Foreign nationals can travel to most places in Kazakhstan, but if visitors want to travel to any ‘closed territories’ or secure areas, advance permission from the relevant authorities is required. Some military/restricted areas are not clearly marked so be careful when travelling away from normal routes.

Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised, so rarely take place. Visitors should avoid any demonstrations or political gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby violence, leave the area immediately.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Kazakhstan is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

There have been a number of violent attacks and muggings on the expatriate community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan, and in Astana and Almaty. Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport.

Visitors should take sensible precautions to protect yourself from crime while in Kazakhstan:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Passports must be carried at all times in case police ask for identification. Keep your passport in a safe place at all times.
* As in many major cities, be careful of petty crime in Astana, Kazakhstan’s capital city. This includes theft from vehicles waiting at traffic lights or parked cars and the copying of cash or credit cards at fraudulent ATM machines.
* Robberies have taken place on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.
* Be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Some visitors have been drugged and subsequently robbed.

### **Lost or stolen passports**

Report the loss of a passport immediately to the police and get confirmation of the loss in writing. Visitors need this report when applying for an emergency passport from the [**Irish Embassy in Moscow**](/en/moscow/).

The Embassy can accept applications for new passports, which may take between four and six weeks to be processed in Dublin, but it cannot issue new full passports.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Kazakhstan, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the [**Irish Embassy in Moscow**](/en/moscow/) if help is required.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Kazakhstan, exercise caution and bring your international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check the insurance is adequate and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car. We advise hiring licensed taxicabs while in Kazakhstan, rather than private unlicensed hackney cabs.
