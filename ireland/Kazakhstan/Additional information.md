## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visas**

Citizens can travel to Kazakhstan without a visa, provided stay does not exceed 30 days (the day of arrival counts as day 1, regardless of arrival time). If citizens wish to stay longer than 30 days, visa is required.

Citizens should ensure to have the correct visa for the purpose of travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of visa and any associated restrictions carefully before travel.

If citizens violate the conditions of a visa, they could face a short term of imprisonment and/or a ban on entry to Kazakhstan for up to 5 years. Overstaying the date written on a white immigration card may result in similar penalties, regardless of the validity of a visa.

For more information on entry requirements for Kazakhstan, please contact the [**Embassy of Kazakhstan in London**](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/mfa-london?lang=en).

### **Passports**

Visitors must have their passport at all times in Kazakhstan as well as the migration card received when entering the country. Genuine police officials should always present their own credentials when asking for proof of identity

### **Immigration cards**

At airports and border posts, Kazakhstani immigration officials will present visitors with a white immigration card. Visitors must keep this card while travelling in Kazakhstan and present it at the airport/border posts when departing.

### **Crossing the border**

We advise not to cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally as the absence of entry/exit stamps will cause problems (e.g. possible detention, fines) when leaving or re-entering the country.

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Kazakhstan.

### **Tick-borne encephalitis**

Ticks carrying encephalitis are a problem in mountains and forests, particularly during April, May and June.

### **Other illnesses**

There have been reports of human rabies cases in recent years. Cases of tuberculosis have been reported in the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk regions, as well as in prisons.

### **Money**

Most hotels, restaurants and larger shops accept credit cards, but smaller shops and taxi drivers do not. ATMs exist in most major cities but visitors should bring enough money for the duration of the trip. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not normally accepted.

### **Currency**

The tenge is the unit of currency in Kazakhstan. If visitors wish to buy tenge in Kazakhstan, we advise to take Euro or US dollars to change (US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency). All notes should be in good condition.

Only change money at banks, hotels and recognised exchange kiosks - it is an offence to change money from street traders. Bring your passport and visa, as they will need to be shown when changing money.
