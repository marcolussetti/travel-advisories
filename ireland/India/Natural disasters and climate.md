## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

India is a vast and diverse country. Travel in certain parts can be problematic because of specific local conditions, so trips should be thoroughly planned and researched.

Parts of India are prone to extreme adverse weather, geological conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, landslides, cyclones and earthquakes. Parts of southern India were severely affected by the South Asian tsunami of December 2004.

### **Flooding**

Depending on the area of the country, the monsoon season lasts from June to October and every year causes numerous casualties. Monsoon rains cause flooding and landslides, which can cut off towns and villages and disrupt transport services, even in urban areas. If travelling during the monsoon season, make sure to check local weather conditions, follow the advice of local authorities and take all necessary precautions.

Heavy flooding in Kerala in 2018 caused around 360 people to lose their lives, as many as 700,000 to be displaced, and relief camps to be established across the state.
