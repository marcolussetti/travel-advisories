## Health

### Vaccinations

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for India are required. If travelling from a country with a risk of yellow fever or polio, have proof of vaccination or you will not be allowed to enter India. There are no exceptions to this rule.

### **COVID-19**

**There are currently no COVID-19 travel restrictions in place for travellers to India from Ireland. However, passengers may be subject to medical screening on arrival. The COVID-19 regulations may change at short notice and can be checked on website of the** [**Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)**.**

### **Food and Water**

Travellers to India should be aware that food and water hygiene standards are not comparable to Ireland. Water-borne and food-borne diseases can cause serious illness and simple precautions include avoiding ice cubes; not drinking tap water; avoiding uncooked and undercooked food, especially from street vendors; and drinking boiled water or bottled water with intact sealed caps.

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Malaria and dengue fever are present in India so care should be taken to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using mosquito repellents. There is prescribed medication to prevent malaria, please seek advice from a doctor. However, there is no medication to prevent Dengue fever. Therefore, take due care to avoid mosquito bites to reduce the potential of infection.

### **Air Pollution**

The main metropoles in Northern India are often subject to severe levels of air pollution during the winter months, which can have short-term and long-term health implications for residents and visitors. We advise citizens to monitor air pollution levels, follow the advice of local authorities and to reduce their exposure to air pollution where possible by staying indoors and avoiding strenuous outdoor activity. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are concerned about the impact of pollution on your health, we advise to seek medical advice before travelling to these locations.

### **Medical Facilities**

The availability of healthcare facilities in India is inconsistent, particularly in rural areas. Check with your travel insurance before you travel to see what hospitals they recommend.

### **Swine Flu**

There has been a number of cases of Swine flu (H1N1) in India. Consult a doctor before travelling for advice, particularly on vaccinations that may be available.
