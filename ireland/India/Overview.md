## Overview

### **Security status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Following recent hostilities, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan was announced on 10 May. We still advise that Irish citizens exercise caution in public places, stay alert, monitor local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Airports in northern and western India have started to reopen and resume flight operations. Some delays may still be expected. Travellers should contact their airline for up to date information.

The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir, the India-Pakistan border, or Manipur. Please see more detailed regional travel advice below.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to travel to India unless you are an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholder. If you arrive in India without a visa, you will be refused entry and will likely be detained in police custody and deported. If you over-stay your visa, you will be fined and may be prosecuted or detained and later deported. If you over-stay your visa or if you lose your passport, you will have to obtain an [exit visa](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp) from the Indian government before you can leave India. This must be done [online](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp) and can take a considerable amount of time even for straightforward applications. Make sure to factor this into your timeframe to leave India if you are booking flights.

You will need your passport with a valid visa to get accommodation in India. Visitors who have overstayed their Indian visa have found it difficult to find accommodation.

If you are transiting through India, you may need a transit visa if you must collect your baggage to transfer it to another airline or if you are travelling on multiple bookings. Baggage collection areas in Indian airports are normally after clearing immigration.

If you are unsure of what the entry requirements for India are, including visa details, whether you need a transit visa and other immigration information, you should contact the [**Embassy of India in Dublin**](http://www.indianembassydublin.in/), or consult the [**Bureau of Immigration**](https://boi.gov.in/) or the [**Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)**](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp) websites.

A valid passport is required for travel to India. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months and have at least two blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to India are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrlEmbIndia**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbIndia) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinIndia/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **North-West**

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir, including the cities of Pahalgam, Srinagar and Jammu.

Irish citizens in the Union Territory of Ladakh should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities, and monitor developments in the local and Indian media. We advise against all travel within 10km of the India-Pakistan border and note the closure of the Wagah-Atarri border crossing.

### **North-East**

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel to Manipur.

Recently, the Union Home Ministry has re-imposed the Protected Area Regime (PAR) in **Manipur, Nagaland,** and **Mizoram** to monitor the movement of foreigners amid growing security concerns.

Foreigners visiting the three north-eastern States are required to seek prior permission and special permits from the government. According to Ministry guidelines, a foreigner is not encouraged to visit protected areas unless there are “extraordinary reasons to justify a visit”.

Irish citizens travelling in or through either the Darjeeling hills, Sikkim or the Cooch Behar district of West Bengal are advised to exercise a high degree of caution, follow the advice of the local authorities, monitor local media and avoid any demonstrations or gatherings.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if problems arise, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Contact the emergency services in India by dialling 112 or 100. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 100/112
* Fire brigade: 101
* Ambulance: 102
