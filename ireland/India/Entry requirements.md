## Entry requirements

### **Special Permits**

Passengers should note that special permits are required to visit certain areas of the country including Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, the Andaman Islands and parts of Sikkim. More information is available from the [**Indian Ministry of Home Affairs**](https://mha.gov.in/MHA1/PAP.html).

### **Passport**

Passports must be valid for a minimum of six months.

### **Registration**

If arriving in India on a long-term multiple entry visa, you must register with the nearest Foreign Regional Registration Officer within 14 days of your arrival. If you do not register, you may not be allowed to exit India.

### **E-arrival card**

Irish citizens must complete an e-arrival card (digital disembarkation form) online when arriving in India, before reaching immigration. This form replaces the paper-based arrival card, although these will continue to be accepted until March 2026.

The e-arrival card can be completed online up to 72 hours before you arrive. For more details, please check the Indian visa website. The e-arrival card is not a visa, and a valid visa or OCI card will still be required to enter India.
