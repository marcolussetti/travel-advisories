## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Sudan, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the Embassy of Sudan in London.

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Sudan.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Sudan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Sudan and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.
* Assist you in applying for a new passport.

We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy in Sudan there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

You should contact the Embassy in Nairobi in Kenya or to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport.

### **Climate**

The temperature in the summer months in some areas can reach over 40 degrees Celsius. Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Sudan can suffer from drought.

Heavy rains can occur, and the flood risk can be high, especially during July to September. Overland travel will likely be disrupted, with roads and bridges inaccessible.

### **Sandstorms**

Sudan is prone to sandstorms. Local services, water availability and basic food maybe affected. Observe preventative measures and exercise extreme caution.
