## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Sudan is a Muslim country in which Islamic law, customs and dress are universally respected. You should respect them fully. You may not seek to convert Muslims to other faiths.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. Guide books, local hoteliers and tour guides can be good sources of information for how to behave and dress respectfully.

### **Sharia law**

Sharia law is an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties under Sharia law can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. If you’re travelling in an area governed by Sharia law, we advise you to respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities. Travellers should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, arms and head.

### **Female travellers**

Female travellers can face particular issues around security and dealing with the religious and cultural beliefs of the countries they visit (especially if they’re travelling alone). We advise you to always do some research before you travel, so you know what to expect from the country you’re visiting.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

Alcohol is not permitted in Sudan.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual practices and extramarital relations are illegal and subject to severe penalties under Islamic Sharia law.

### **Photography**

You need a permit for photography. Even with a permit, photographing airports, military cars, bridges, drainage stations, broadcast stations, public utilities, slum areas or beggars is strictly prohibited.

### **Family law**

Parents in particular should be aware that local laws regarding custody of children are significantly different to those in force in Ireland. If you are involved in any legal matters, particularly with regard to family law, we strongly advise you to seek professional legal advice.
