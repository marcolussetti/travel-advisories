## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Armed conflict, which broke out across Sudan on 15 April 2023, has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries. The security situation across the country is very volatile and may deteriorate further at any time. Irish citizens should not travel to Sudan at this time, due to armed conflict, civil unrest and the volatile security situation.

### **Demonstrations**

There have been frequent demonstrations in Sudan in recent years, often leading to violent clashes in Khartoum and other cities and several Embassies have been attacked.

You should avoid all protests and demonstrations and should not try to take photographs of demonstrations. If caught up in a demonstration, leave the area immediately. Closely monitor the local media for updates on the situation.
