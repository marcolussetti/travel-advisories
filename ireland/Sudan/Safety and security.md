## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Armed conflict, which broke out across Sudan on 15 April 2023, has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries. The security situation across the country is very volatile and may deteriorate further at any time. Irish citizens should not travel to Sudan at this time, due to armed conflict, civil unrest and the volatile security situation.

In addition to the ongoing armed conflict, there are regular outbreaks of violence and instability in the Abyei region and adjoining areas, the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, parts of Darfur, areas of eastern Sudan close to the border with Eritrea, and south-eastern border regions with Ethiopia around the agricultural region of al-Fashaga al-Sughra.

Be extremely cautious around areas that may be sensitive to the government, including military installations, border areas and camps for internationally-displaced persons.

### **Demonstrations**

There have been frequent demonstrations in Sudan in recent years, often leading to violent clashes in Khartoum and other cities and several Embassies have been attacked.

You should avoid all protests and demonstrations and should not try to take photographs of demonstrations. If caught up in a demonstration, leave the area immediately. Closely monitor the local media for updates on the situation.

### **Air travel**

Sudan’s airspace has been closed to all civilian flights since 16 April 2023. Khartoum International Airport is currently closed. There are serious concerns about the safety and reliability of local airlines in Sudan. [**Many of these airlines are banned from operating in European airspace**](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm).

### **Regional travel**

Locally-obtained permits are required for all travel to many destinations outside Khartoum, including Darfur.

### **Terrorism**

There is a risk of terrorism in all parts of Sudan including Khartoum.

### **Kidnapping**

There is a risk of kidnapping in all parts of Sudan including Khartoum.

### **Landmines**

Landmines pose a threat in rural areas in many parts of the country.
