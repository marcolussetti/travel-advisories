### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Sudan where there is ongoing military conflict.

The situation is very volatile and may deteriorate further at any time. Citizens should monitor this Travel Advice and reliable media sources for the latest information.

In general, citizens in areas affected by conflict should shelter in place, remain indoors and observe local restrictions. If they judge it is safe to do, citizens may decide to seek to depart Sudan at their own risk. Travel routes and onward destination entry requirements should be assessed carefully before deciding to travel.

Khartoum International Airport is currently closed.

Limited commercial options for departure from Sudan are available, including by air and on commercial ferries. Citizens seeking to depart using commercial options do so at their own risk. There are serious concerns about the safety and reliability of local airlines in Sudan with many [**banned from operating in European airspace.**](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-safety-list_en)

Citizens seeking to depart Sudan for neighbouring countries by other means should take careful advice before doing so as border crossings may be closed, or may involve long transit and processing times, with very little infrastructure at these border crossings.  The onward destination's entry requirements should be checked prior to travelling.

Any citizens arriving in countries neighbouring Sudan can contact the relevant Irish Embassy for assistance (the list can be found [**here**](/en/dfa/embassies/)).

Irish citizens in Sudan who have not already done so should urgently [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in Kenya which is accredited to Sudan.

Ireland does not have a diplomatic mission in Sudan, and the capacity to provide consular assistance to citizens there is limited.

**The Embassy of Ireland in Kenya is the main point of contact for consular assistance for Irish citizens in Sudan, and for general queries in relation to Sudan. The Embassy’s contact details can be found** [**here**](/en/kenya/nairobi/)**.**
