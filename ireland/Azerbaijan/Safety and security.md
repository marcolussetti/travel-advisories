## Safety and security

The political situation in Azerbaijan is stable. Demonstrations occasionally take place, mainly in Baku. Opposition rallies are usually heavily policed and there has been violence on occasions. We advise that visitors avoid large demonstrations and public gatherings.

We strongly advise against all travel to some areas in south-western Azerbaijan, including districts in and around the region formerly known as “Nagorno-Karabakh”, as these areas are heavily land-mined, and unexploded devices may be encountered. Azerbaijan launched a military operation in the region formerly known as “Nagorno-Karabakh” in September 2023 which had been subject of a continuing dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We strongly advise against all travel to within 5 km of the border with Armenia.

Irish citizens should always stay informed of developments by monitoring local media and staying in contact with their hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreign nationals such as international hotels, restaurants and pubs. Take sensible precautions and be vigilant.

### **Crime**

Crime rates are relatively low in Azerbaijan but muggings can take place, particularly around bars and clubs and near dimly lit entrances of private apartments.

Cases of theft, intimidation, sexual harassment and sexual assault can also occur. If you are the victim of a crime, the Embassy can offer confidential support, including advice on how to access appropriate services.

Visitors should take sensible precautions:

* Irish citizens should carry their passport at all times as police often carry out identity checks. Ensure that it is kept secure and leave a photocopy of the details page separately in a safe place.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Do not leave valuables, or bags that may appear to contain valuables, visible in parked cars.
* Remain vigilant when frequenting bar and nightclubs. Always keep your drink with you and avoid accepting food or drinks from strangers or new acquaintances.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Azerbaijan, report it to the local police immediately. Emergency services can be contacted by dialling 102.

Citizens can also contact the Embassy of Ireland in Türkiye for consular assistance.

### **Taxis**

It is advisable to use taxis ordered by hotels or order via a known company or ride-hailing app.

Foreign visitors have reported being overcharged by local taxis. Ensure the taximeter is on at the beginning of your journey or that you have agreed a fare up front, be aware that most old taxis do not have seat belts.

### **Driving**

Take extra care if you are planning to drive in Azerbaijan, especially at night. Roads tend to be badly lit and of poor quality, and many cars are poorly maintained. If driving, bring your international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware of Azerbaijan’s traffic laws, such as speed limits.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over a passport as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in your sight at all times.

We advise Irish citizens to always ensure that they have adequate insurance and have read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Earthquakes**

While there have been no serious recent earthquakes in Azerbaijan, visitors should be aware that Azerbaijan is located in an active seismic zone and there is the potential for earthquakes across the Caucasus region.

Visitors should familiarise themselves with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake, and follow the advice of local authorities.
