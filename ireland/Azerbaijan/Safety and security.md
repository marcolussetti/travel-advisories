## Safety and security

The political situation in Azerbaijan is stable. Demonstrations occasionally take place, mainly in Baku. Opposition rallies are usually heavily policed and there has been violence on occasions. We advise that visitors avoid large demonstrations and public gatherings.

We strongly advise against all travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, the areas surrounding it as these areas are heavily land-mined, and unexploded devices may be encountered. Azerbaijan launched a military operation in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023, which had been subject of a continuing dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We strongly advise against all travel to within 5 km of the border with Armenia.

Irish citizens should always stay informed of developments by monitoring local media and staying in contact with their hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreign nationals such as international hotels, restaurants and pubs. Take sensible precautions and be vigilant.

### **Crime**

Crime rates are relatively low in Azerbaijan but occasional muggings do take place, particularly around bars and clubs and near dimly lit entrances of private apartments. Visitors should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.

### **Reporting crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Azerbaijan, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact the Embassy of Ireland in TÃ¼rkiye if you need assistance.

### **Driving**

If you are planning to drive in Azerbaijan, especially at night take extra care. Roads tend to be badly lit and of poor quality and many cars are poorly maintained. If driving, bring your international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over a passport as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in your sight at all times.

We advise Irish citizens to always ensure that they have adequate insurance and have read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Be aware that most old taxis do not have seat belts.

### **Earthquake**

While there have been no serious recent earthquakes in Azerbaijan, visitors should be aware that Azerbaijan is located in an active seismic zone and there is the potential for earthquakes across the Caucasus region
