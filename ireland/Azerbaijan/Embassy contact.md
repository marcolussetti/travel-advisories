## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Azerbaijan, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Ankara,Turkiye**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/turkiye/ankara/)**.**

The Embassy is open Monday to Friday 09.00 - 13.00 and 14.00 - 17.00. Please note that the time zone in Türkiye is one hour earlier than in Azerbaijan.

If you require assistance in the case of an emergency while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy number, 00 90 312 4591000, and leave a voicemail message on the Duty Officer

This mailbox will be monitored regularly and the Embassy will contact you if you require emergency assistance.
