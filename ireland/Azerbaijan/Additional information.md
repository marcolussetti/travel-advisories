### **Entry Requirements**

### **Visas**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Azerbaijan. You can apply online using the e-visa site at [**https://evisa.gov.az/en/**](https://evisa.gov.az/en/). Visas are valid for 90 days, and stays must not exceed 30 days in total.

### **Passports**

Irish passports must be valid for more than 3 months after the expiry date of your visa for Azerbaijan. This means your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Azerbaijan

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies with you. Irish citizens should carry their passport at all times as police often carry out identity checks. Ensure that it is kept secure and leave a photocopy of the details page separately in a safe place.

### **Entry restrictions**

Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh in the past without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan.

Visitors should not attempt to enter Azerbaijan via the land borders with Russia (i.e. Dagestan), Iran and Georgia as these as these are closed to foreign nationals.
