### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises visitors to exercise a high degree of caution in Azerbaijan.

The Department of Foreign Affairs advises against all travel:

* within 5km of the border with Armenia.
* to some areas in south-western Azerbaijan, including districts in and around the region formerly known as “Nagorno-Karabakh”.

There is a strong military presence in the region formerly known as “Nagorno-Karabakh” and travel to the area is not possible without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities. Visitors to the region could also encounter unexploded weapons and landmines.

For further information, please read the Safety and Security section of this page.

### **General Travel Advice**

### **Entry Requirements**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Azerbaijan. Citizens can apply online using the [**e-visa website**](https://evisa.gov.az/en/). Visas are valid for 90 days, and stays must not exceed 30 days in total.

A valid passport is required for travel to Azerbaijan. Passport cards **cannot** be used. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months from the expiry date of your Azerbaijani visa. This means your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Azerbaijan.

### **Entry Restrictions**

Anyone who has visited the region formerly known as “Nagorno-Karabakh” in the past without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan.

Visitors should not attempt to enter Azerbaijan via the land borders with Russia (i.e. Dagestan) and Georgia as these as these are closed to foreign nationals.

To enter from Iran, permission for Irish citizens to enter Azerbaijan by land border from Iran may be facilitated subject to the permission of the authorities and must be coordinated in advance by the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Türkiye. Please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Türkiye or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin if you are intending to make this journey.

For further information on entry requirements, please read the ‘Additional Information’ section of this page.

### **Emergency Assistance**

Visitors to Azerbaijan are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Azerbaijan. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 102
* Fire brigade: 101
