## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are needed for Azerbaijan.

### **Medical facilities**

Medical facilities outside Baku are very limited. Even in Baku serious illness or injury may require evacuation to Türkiye or Western Europe. You should make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Department cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

Make sure that you have saved the contact information for your insurance provider before you depart, including any emergency assistance details, and have this information to hand should you need it while abroad.

### **Emergency expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you are sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
