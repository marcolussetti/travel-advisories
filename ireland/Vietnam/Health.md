## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country.

### **Health Care / Health Insurance**

The standard of health care is sufficient for treating minor injuries and performing simple operations in the major cities but if you need more complicated treatment you may need to be evacuated to another country. Please ensure that you have adequate health insurance to cover this eventuality.

### Bottled Water

We would advise that you drink plenty of bottled water when travelling in Vietnam.

Don’t drink water from the tap and avoid ice in your drinks.

### **Air Pollution**

High levels of air pollution may arise in major cities in Vietnam. Polluted air can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and irritation of the eyes and nose. Young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying heart and respiratory issues are particularly vulnerable. Members of the public can monitor air pollution levels at [**http://aqicn.org/map/vietnam/**](http://aqicn.org/map/vietnam/). During periods of high air pollution, people in affected areas, especially those in the high-risk groups, are advised to:

* minimise outdoor activity
* reduce physical exertion
* keep windows and doors closed
* use an air purifier
* consider using a respirator mask

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness, is endemic across Vietnam including in key tourist destinations. Visitors to Vietnam are advised to take appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using insect repellents, covering up and using mosquito nets, and to seek early medical advice if they experience symptoms of the virus. There are no medications which you can take to prevent dengue fever. Please consult your doctor or [**http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/faq/en/**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue) for further information.

### **Avian Flu**

Outbreaks of avian flu have occurred from time to time in Vietnam. The risk of transmission to humans can be reduced by avoiding live animal markets, poultry farms, and contact with domestic or wild birds, and ensuring that meals containing poultry and eggs are properly cooked.

### **Zika Virus**

Vietnam is among the locations where there may be a risk of contracting the Zika Virus. Irish Citizens are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) at [**http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/.**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/)

In particular, if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and plan to travel to areas affected by Zika Virus, you are advised to discuss your travel plans with your healthcare provider and to consider postponing your travel to affected areas.
