## Natural disasters and climate

### **Typhoons**

The typhoon season in Central and Northern Vietnam normally runs from June to December. Typhoons can bring very strong wind, heavy rainfall and flooding, and disruption to transport. During this season, there can be several significant typhoons in close proximity to each other. If you are travelling to Vietnam during this period, be aware that you may need to change your travel plans at short notice. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. It is also advisable to carry with you emergency contact details for your airline, tour operator, and insurance company.

### **Flooding**

Storms, especially in the Central Region, Mekong Delta, and in the mountainous Northern provinces, often lead to heavy and dangerous flooding. Severe flooding has impacted Hanoi in recent years. Heavy rainfall and flooding often occur several days after the actual typhoon or storm has passed. Flooding can disrupt transport links and access to essential services, and roads may become impassable due to dangerous landslides. It may result in you being unable to leave your accommodation. During periods of heavy rain, you should remain vigilant to the risk of flooding/landslides, stay away from flooded areas, monitor local media and weather reports for updates, and pay close attention to instructions from local authorities (including any evacuation orders).
