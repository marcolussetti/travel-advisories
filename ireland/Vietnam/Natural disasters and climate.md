## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

In Vietnam, the climate is tropical in the north and subtropical in the center and south, and it's influenced by the **monsoons**: the south-west monsoon affects the country from May to October, and the northeast monsoon from October to April. The former brings heavy rainfall in both the north and the south, while central Vietnam is protected by the mountains, and experiences relatively little rain. The north-east monsoon is generally drier, but it brings heavy rains in the early months (October-December) along the coast exposed to the east, and light but frequent rains in the north.  
In inland areas, there are **hills and mountains**, which make the climate milder in the summer months, but cold in winter in the north.  
The amount of **rainfall** is normally between 1,500 and 2,500 millimeters (60 and 98 inches) per year, but there's also a relatively small arid zone in the Phan Thiet area (north-east of Ho Chi Minh City), where it's slightly above 1,000 mm (40 in).

### **Natural Disasters**

Given the size and location of Vietnam, it experiences all types of natural disasters.  Approx. 1,000 people die each year due to natural disasters in Vietnam.

### **Typhoons**

The typhoon season in Central and Northern Vietnam normally runs from June to December. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Flooding**

Storms, especially in the Central Region and Mekong Delta, often lead to heavy and dangerous flooding. The rainy season varies across the country but is usually from June to October. This can damage transport links and has left whole areas isolated, including border crossing points into Laos. Check the media, weather reports, transport services and with your tour operator before travelling into the interior of the country.

### **Climbing**

Accidents have occurred during mountain-climbing excursions in the north of the country. You’re advised to go with reputable guides.
