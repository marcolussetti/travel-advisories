## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

In Vietnam, the climate is tropical in the north and subtropical in the center and south. Vietnam experiences monsoons: the south-west monsoon affects the country from May to October, and the northeast monsoon from October to April. The former brings heavy rainfall in both the north and the south, while central Vietnam is protected by the mountains, and experiences relatively little rain. The north-east monsoon is generally drier, but it brings heavy rains in the early months (October-December) along the coast exposed to the east, and light but frequent rains in the north.

In inland areas, which are hilly and mountainous, the climate is milder in the summer months. The mountainous regions in the north, are cold in winter.

### **Natural Disasters**

Given the size and location of Vietnam, it experiences all types of natural disasters.  Approx. 1,000 people die each year due to natural disasters in Vietnam.

### **Typhoons**

The typhoon season in Central and Northern Vietnam normally runs from June to December. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Flooding**

Storms, especially in the Central Region and Mekong Delta, often lead to heavy and dangerous flooding, with risk of landslides. This can damage transport links and has left whole areas isolated, including border crossing points into Laos. Check the media, weather reports, transport services and with your tour operator before travelling into the interior of the country.

### **Climbing**

Accidents have occurred during mountain-climbing excursions in the north of the country. You’re advised to go with reputable guides.
