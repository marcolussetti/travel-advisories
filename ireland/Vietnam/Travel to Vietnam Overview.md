### **General Travel Advice**

All Irish passport holders are required to hold a visa before travelling to Vietnam. Irish visitors travelling to Vietnam can apply for an eVisa through Vietnam Immigration’s [**eVisa portal**](https://evisa.gov.vn/) (please note that this is the **only** official eVisa portal for Vietnam). These visas can be single or multiple entry and are valid for up to 90 days. For other types of visas, please contact your nearest Vietnamese Embassy.

Please ensure that you leave yourself ample time when applying for your visa. Ensure also that you carefully enter all your details exactly as they appear on your passport (including middle names), and check the portal regularly for updates on your application. The Embassy of Ireland cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet Vietnam’s entry requirements

If you hold a temporary passport, please contact your nearest Vietnamese Embassy for advice before travelling as you may not be able to obtain a visa.

Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Vietnam are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X@[**irlembvietnam**](https://twitter.com/irlembvietnam) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassyinvietnam/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
