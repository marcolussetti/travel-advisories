## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behavior may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

You should avoid any involvement with drugs. Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including the death penalty, which is enforced in Vietnam. Illegal drugs are likely to have been tampered with or spiked.

### **Crime**

Sex offences or fraud can result in long prison terms or a death sentence. Foreign visitors are not allowed to invite Vietnamese nationals into their hotel rooms.
