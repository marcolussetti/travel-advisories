## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behavior may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

You should avoid any involvement with drugs. Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including the death penalty, which is enforced in Vietnam. Illegal drugs are likely to have been tampered with or spiked.

### **Crime**

Sex offences or fraud can result in long prison terms or a death sentence. Foreign visitors are not allowed to invite Vietnamese nationals into their hotel rooms.

### **Money**

You should bring enough money for your stay. Euros and US dollars are usually easily changed into Vietnamese dong (VND). Credit cards are becoming more widely known, but outside the main centres you may find that cash is the only acceptable currency and you may find it difficult to cash travellers’ cheques. ATM distribution is still poor and limited to the major cities and tourist areas. However, you can transfer money to Vietnam by international money transfer companies. Foreign passport holders can exchange up to US$500 worth of Vietnamese dong back into US dollars on departure.
