## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to visit Vietnam.

Irish **tourists** intending to stay less than 90 days in Vietnam should apply for a **multiple**entry e-visa through the [**eVisa portal**](https://evisa.gov.vn/)  of Vietnam Immigration. Please note that this is the only official e-Visa portal for Vietnam.

The Embassy is unable to contact Vietnam Immigration on behalf of citizens.  All queries relating to e-visas should be directed to Vietnam Immigration through the query form on the portal, or by emailing [**contact@immigration.gov.vn**](mailto:contact@immigration.gov.vn)

Tourist visas cannot be extended. Paid or volunteer work, missionary work, or other activities not related to tourism are not allowed under tourist visas.

Irish citizens travelling for purposes other than tourism need to contact their business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with the relevant Vietnamese authorities to arrange the issuance of a visa.  If you are unable to prove that you have made the necessary visa arrangements, you may be denied boarding, or be deported at your own expense on arrival in Vietnam.

You may need to check with your nearest Vietnamese Embassy the duration for which your passport must be valid as this will vary according to the type of visa you require and the intended duration of your stay. Passport cards cannot be used.

If you hold a temporary passport, please contact your nearest Vietnamese Embassy for advice before travelling as you may not be able to obtain a visa.

While tourists may enter the Phu Quoc special zone without a visa for a stay of up to 15 days, please note that if you are intending to travel onwards to other parts of Vietnam, you must obtain a visa before travelling. Tourists arriving in Ho Chi Minh City or other domestic airports from Phu Quoc without the necessary visa may be detained by the immigration authorities.

### **Health**

### **Health- General**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. The standard of health care is sufficient for treating minor injuries and performing simple operations in the major cities but if you need more complicated treatment you may need to be evacuated to another country. Please ensure that you have adequate health insurance to cover this eventuality.

We would advise that you drink plenty of bottled water when travelling in Vietnam.

Don’t drink water from the tap and avoid ice in your drinks.

### **Air Pollution**

High levels of air pollution may arise in major cities in Vietnam. Polluted air can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and irritation of the eyes and nose. Young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying heart and respiratory issues are particularly vulnerable. Members of the public can monitor air pollution levels at [**http://aqicn.org/map/vietnam/**](http://aqicn.org/map/vietnam/). During periods of high air pollution, people in affected areas, especially those in the high-risk groups, are advised to:

* minimise outdoor activity
* reduce physical exertion
* keep windows and doors closed
* use an air purifier
* consider using a respirator mask

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness, is endemic across Vietnam including in key tourist destinations. Visitors to Vietnam are advised to take appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using insect repellents, covering up and using mosquito nets, and to seek early medical advice if they experience symptoms of the virus. There are no medications which you can take to prevent dengue fever. Please consult your doctor or [**http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/faq/en/**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue) for further information.

### **Avian Flu**

Outbreaks of avian flu have occurred from time to time in Vietnam. The risk of transmission to humans can be reduced by avoiding live animal markets, poultry farms, and contact with domestic or wild birds, and ensuring that meals containing poultry and eggs are properly cooked.

### **Zika Virus**

Vietnam is among the locations where there may be a risk of contracting the Zika Virus. Irish Citizens are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) at [**http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/.**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/)

In particular, if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and plan to travel to areas affected by Zika Virus, you are advised to discuss your travel plans with your healthcare provider and to consider postponing your travel to affected areas.

### **Money**

You should bring enough money for your stay. Euros and US dollars are usually easily changed into Vietnamese dong (VND). Credit cards are becoming more widely known, but outside the main centres you may find that cash is the only acceptable currency and you may find it difficult to cash travellers’ cheques. ATM distribution is still poor and limited to the major cities and tourist areas. However, you can transfer money to Vietnam by international money transfer companies. Foreign passport holders can exchange up to US$500 worth of Vietnamese dong back into US dollars on departure.
