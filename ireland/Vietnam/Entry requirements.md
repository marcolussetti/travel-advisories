## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens require a visa to visit Vietnam.

Irish **tourists** intending to stay less than 90 days in Vietnam should apply for a single or multiple entry e-visa through the [**eVisa portal**](https://evisa.gov.vn/) of Vietnam Immigration. Please note that this is the only official e-Visa portal for Vietnam. If you also intend to travel to Laos or Cambodia after arriving in Vietnam , you should apply for a **multi** entry visa to allow for re-entry to Vietnam.

The Embassy is unable to contact Vietnam Immigration on behalf of citizens.  All queries relating to e-visas should be directed to Vietnam Immigration through the query form on the portal, or by emailing [**contact@immigration.gov.vn**](mailto:contact@immigration.gov.vn)

Tourist visas cannot be extended. Paid or volunteer work, missionary work, or other activities not related to tourism are not allowed under tourist visas.

Irish citizens travelling for purposes other than tourism need to contact their business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with the relevant Vietnamese authorities to arrange the issuance of a visa.  If you are unable to prove that you have made the necessary visa arrangements, you may be denied boarding, or be deported at your own expense on arrival in Vietnam.

You may need to check with your nearest Vietnamese Embassy the duration for which your passport must be valid as this will vary according to the type of visa you require and the intended duration of your stay. Passport cards cannot be used.

If you hold a temporary passport, please contact your nearest Vietnamese Embassy for advice before travelling as you may not be able to obtain a visa.

While tourists may enter the Phu Quoc special zone without a visa for a stay of up to 15 days, please note that if you are intending to travel onwards to other parts of Vietnam, you must obtain a visa before travelling. Tourists arriving in Ho Chi Minh City or other domestic airports from Phu Quoc without the necessary visa may be detained by the immigration authorities.
