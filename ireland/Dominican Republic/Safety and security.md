## Safety and security

### **Hurricane Season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. Pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

### **Crime**

Crime is prevalent in Dominican Republic. Petty theft, such as pick-pocketing and bag-snatching, is relatively common. Incidents have occurred where foreigners have been mugged at gunpoint or knifepoint during the daytime while walking in residential districts.

Citizens should be particularly vigilant when on the street. Avoid remote areas, particularly after dark. Do not wear expensive jewellery or carry large amounts of cash. Do not leave your bags or other belongings on chairs or tables in restaurants and bars.

### **Driving**

Travellers can use an Irish driver’s license for a period of up to 90 days from their entry into the territory. If you want to drive, keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

Take extreme care with passports and other personal documentation. If a passport is lost or stolen, it can take up to three weeks to get a replacement, due to time and distance factors. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if travellers are able to provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies or scans of passports.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of crime while in Dominican Republic, report it to the [**local police**](https://www.policianacional.gob.do/contacto/) immediately. Many insurance companies will only compensate loss from theft if travellers can provide a police report.

The Tourist Police have English-speaking officers and accept reports in English. The mobile application “[**Politur**](https://politur.gob.do/politur-app/)” is available to report an emergency, locate nearby police stations and speak with a police officer. The app is also available in English.

[**Contact us**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/colombia/bogota/contact/) at the Embassy if you require assistance.

### **Road Safety**

Dominican Republic has a high traffic-related death rate. Road accidents happen often, especially during holiday periods like summer, Christmas and Easter. Be cautious if you are driving during your stayand take care when walking on the streets.

If you are involved in an accident, call the police and wait at the scene. You may also contact your insurance company for guidance. If you are detained because of a road accident, ask the police to contact the Embassy.

### **Taxis**

Where possible, plan how you will travel to and from your destination. Only use pre-booked taxis. We strongly advise against hailing taxis from the street.

### **Dominican Republic-Haiti Border**

The Dominican Republic-Haiti border remain closed to travellers. Crossing the border by land or sea is not allowed. Disturbances and incidents are common, some of which can lead to violence. Avoid the border area as the security situation is highly volatile.

### **Safe Swimming**

Be careful when swimming or taking part in water sports as lifeguards may not be present at swimming pools or on beaches. Check with residents and tour operators for information on safe swimming areas. Follow instructions about sea conditions and warning systems.
