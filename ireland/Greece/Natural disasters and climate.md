## Natural disasters and climate

### **Wildfires**

Large-scales fires and extreme temperatures can affect a number of areas in Greece, particularly in the summer months.

Wildfires are highly dangerous, unpredictable, and fast moving so you should stay away from affected areas and comply with evacuation orders or instructions from the emergency services, police and local authorities.

If a situation escalates, local authorities may send warnings to all mobile phones in the vicinity, which will sound like a loud alarm. The text of the warning will be in English below the Greek. Take any action advised (though some alerts are precautionary only). Sometimes there will be organised evacuation, and in some instances, where very large numbers of people need to be moved quickly, you may need to make your own arrangements. If evacuation is advised, do not wait, and follow the instructions on which direction to move in. Ensure roaming is turned on to receive any mobile phone alerts from local authorities.

Stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Call the Greek Emergency Services on 112 if in immediate danger.

### **Earthquakes**

Greece is located in an active seismic zone and tremors are common, although serious earthquakes are not so frequent. The following information from the Greek Ministry of Tourism sets out what to do in the event of an earthquake.

If you are inside a building:

* Remain calm
* Take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture (table, desk etc.), get on your knees and hold on to the leg of the table or the desk
* If a sturdy piece of furniture does not exist, get on your knees in the middle the room, stay as low as possible and cover your head with your hands. Keep away from large glass surfaces such as windows, or furniture and objects that might hurt you.
* Do not try to leave the building.
* Do not get out on a balcony, if one exists

If you are in a tall building:

* Keep away from glass windows and outer walls

If in a shopping mall or a big commercial store:

* Remain calm
* Stay exactly where you are until the tremble comes to a stop
* Do not get swept away by the running crowd rushing towards the exits because there is a high risk of being stepped over.

If you are outside:

* Get away from places situated exactly underneath buildings or from places where there are telephone or electricity cables.
* If carrying a bag or backpack, put it over your head in order to protect yourself.

If you are in a car:

* Go to an open space and stop the car somewhere where it does not impede the circulation of other vehicles
* Keep away from tunnels or bridges
