## Health

### Heat health

Exposure to excessive temperatures can cause illness such as heat stress and heat stroke. The [Health Service Executive](https://www.hpsc.ie/news/title-24427-en.html) has issued the following guidance for staying safe:

* Be aware of the weather forecasts for your destination.
* Follow any local heat-health alert advice.
* Consider who in your party is most vulnerable – e.g. young children and older people - and plan around making sure they are protected from excessive heat.
* Drink plenty of fluids; avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine, as these can dehydrate you.
* Avoid going out during the hottest parts of the day. If you do go walking, be sure to take plenty of water, sunscreen, and a hat.
* Take regular breaks indoors or in a shaded place to cool down.
* Limit your physical activity to cooler parts of the day, such as morning or evening.
* Keep rooms cool  by closing blinds or curtains to block out the daytime sun; open windows in the mornings and evenings when the air outside is cooler than the air inside.
* Take a cool bath or shower if you feel too hot.
* Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes.

It is easy to lose your way while hiking in Greece, so be cautious about going to isolated areas, especially in hot weather, and make sure you are properly equipped.

### European Health Insurance Card

A valid European Health Insurance card is essential if you are travelling to Greece.

If you are an Irish citizen resident in Ireland, you are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay.

[**Apply for your EHIC and find out more information**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Embassy cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses because of a personal emergency. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

[**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

Your policy should cover:

* All planned activities.
* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. quad biking, water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).
* Private nursing care, if required. Nurses deal solely with medical issues and do not provide assistance with cleaning and feeding. In Greek society it generally falls on the family to provide for all non-essential care to the patient or, when needed, a privately paid nursing assistant.

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Surrogacy in Greece**

Surrogacy in Greece is highly regulated and is subject to a number of restrictions and conditions.

Failure to comply with the requirements of Greek law in the context of surrogacy may give rise to criminal liability.

We strongly advise you to get expert independent legal advice on both Irish and Greek law before entering into a surrogacy arrangement.

The Department of Justice has issued guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering (i) whether a child is an Irish citizen, and (ii) who the child's legal parents and guardians are, for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents on behalf of children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements.

The guidance can be accessed [here](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/childrens-issues-surrogacy-guidance-document.pdf) and applies where you intend on bringing the child to live with you in the State.

This is the **only guidance** that can be given to people considering international surrogacy by the Embassy.

Any Irish citizen considering surrogacy in Greece should contact the Embassy prior to entering into any arrangements in Greece and before the issuance of a court order by a Greek court, which is the formal start of the process. The Embassy can provide further information on the relevant documentation required for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents on behalf of children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements.
