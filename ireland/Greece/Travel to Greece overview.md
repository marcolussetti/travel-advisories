#### **Wildfires**

Greece is currently facing several wildfires following high summer temperatures and subsequent heatwaves. The risk of wildfires is expected to intensify in the coming weeks.

In the case of a wildfire, the authorities will issue notifications regarding evacuations via the 112 message service to all mobile phones in the area. These will be provided in both English and Greek, and we would ask citizens to follow any advice received from local authorities.

Stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Call the Greek Emergency Services on 112 if in immediate danger.

See [**here**](https://www.civilprotection.gr/en/forest-fires) for official information and advice on forest fires in Greece. You can also [**register to get emergency alerts**](https://civilprotection.gov.gr/112) from the Greek Government’s Emergency Communication Service, to get emergency alerts.

#### **Santorini (Thira), Amorgos, Anafi and los**

Following seismic activity in this part of Greece, the authorities have put in place a series of safety measures on Santorini until November, including at the Old Port of Fira, the eastern part of the settlement of Armeni Oia and the Ammoudi Settlement.

Please follow the advice and instruction of local authorities if you are in this region.

Information and instructions on staying safe during an earthquake are available on the website of the [**Greek Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection**](http://www.civilprotection.gov.gr). Maps detailing nearby evacuation points are available at [**mySafetyPlan**](https://mysafetyplan.gov.gr/)**.** If you are in immediate need of assistance, please call 112.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Greece.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Greece. However, those staying for longer than three months are required to register their presence at a local Police Station within 90 days of their arrival.

Irish passport holders, as EU citizens, will not be affected by the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) or the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). These systems refer to the travel of non-EU citizens. General information on the introduction of the EES and the ETIAS can be found on the [**European Union website**](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/index_en)**.**

If you are in Greece, follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. Make sure you have your mobile phone roaming turned on during your stay in Greece so you can receive emergency alerts from the authorities.

You can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbAthens**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbAthens) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyOfIrelandGreece/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
