## Local laws and customs

### **Public behaviour**

High standards of public behaviour are the norm in Greece and the police can arrest you for behaviour that is considered indecent, especially if you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Greek courts impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently in public.

Noise laws are in place in Greece that forbid excessive noise between certain hours. In general, quiet hours include the period between 10pm at night and 7am in the morning, but vary depending on the location. If you are responsible for excessive noise, you could face arrest or a fine.

### **Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

Certain prescriptions medications that may be available in Ireland and other countries are also tightly controlled in Greece. If you are travelling with prescriptions medications, it is advised that you carry with you the prescription issued by your doctor and a letter advising that you require the medication during your stay in Greece.

### **Alcohol**

The legal drinking age in Greece is 18. Visitors should be aware that alcoholic spirits are sold in significantly larger measures in Greek bars and restaurants than in Ireland.

### Make the Right Memories

You can pack a lifetime of memories into a holiday with your friends. But you know that things can sometimes go wrong. The best way to avoid this is to look after each other. That way youâ€™ll come home with the right memories.

1. Keep your phone charged to share live locations, especially on nights out

2. Stay in touch with the people you are travelling with, and with family in Ireland

3. Keep an eye on your drinks in clubs or bars

4. Take a picture of key travel documents like your passport or flight itinerary to keep on your phone

5. Be sure to swim only in designated areas, and when it is safe to do so
