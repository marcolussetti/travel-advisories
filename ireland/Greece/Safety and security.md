## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime is relatively low in Greece as a whole but pickpocketing is common in central Athens. Always take sensible precautions:

* Be aware that during tourist season there is an increase in thefts of passports, wallets, handbags etc. – particularly in crowded areas. Leave valuables in safe custody at your hotel or apartment.
* Be particularly vigilant when using public transport. In Athens, we recommend visitors take extra care of their personal belongings when using buses or the metro; especially when travelling to and from the airport or the port of Piraeus. Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place. Consider wearing your backpack/ rucksack to the front, and do not leave valuables in accessible pockets.
* While in Greece you are legally obliged to have ID on you at all times, however do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary. Instead consider carrying a passport card or driver’s license with you.
* Leave a photocopy (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home, and consider keeping a photo of important documents on your phone or in your emails.

Personal attacks, including sexual assaults and rape, are infrequent in Greece. However, there is a higher incidence of sexual assault and rape on some Greek Islands. We advise not to accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended when in bars or nightclubs. We also recommend avoiding walking alone in isolated areas at night.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you become a victim of a crime while in Greece, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Athens if you need help or guidance.

### **Vehicle Hire**

A full driving licence is required to rent a vehicle, in Greece; provisional Irish licences are not valid. . If you rent a vehicle on a provisional licence, you will invalidate your insurance and will be liable for any vehicle damage.

Never give your passport to a vehicle hire company as security for your vehicle. If the company need a photocopy of your passport, keep it in your sight at all times.

We strongly recommended that you only rent a vehicle from a licenced rental company.

Driving a scooter, moped, motorcycle or quadbike without a licence and insurance is against the law. Check that you have comprehensive insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

If you only have Third Party insurance, you will be fully liable for damage to the vehicle when it is in your possession and you may be charged for the full replacement of the vehicle.

If you fail to pay for damages, the vehicle hire company may call the police and you could face arrest.

### **Road Safety**

If you are driving in Greece, pay attention to different driving customs and road markings. Road lighting can be more limited than in Ireland.

Every year, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and quad bikes are associated with many serious accidents in Greece, often resulting in very critical or even fatal injuries.

If you are involved in a collision or accident, contact the police immediately by calling 112. Do not leave the scene of the accident.

### **Quad Bikes/ATVs**

Quad biking is an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. The use of quads bikes/All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) is not allowed on main roads in Greece.

Insurance may be invalidated if you do not possess full driving license. If you do not get insurance, or only have Third Party insurance, you will be fully liable for any damages that occur to the quad bike when it is in your possession and you may be charged for the full replacement of the vehicle, which can cost several thousand euro.

Before using a quad bike/ATV you should make sure that you receive training and understand the safety rules. The rental company should provide this training to you and should provide safety equipment. Quad bike riders require a full-face helmet (or non-full-face helmet plus goggles) under Greek law.

If you rent a quad bike overnight, we strongly advise that you store it in a secure location.
