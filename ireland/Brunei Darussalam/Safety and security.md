## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime levels are low, but there are occasional incidents of petty crime against tourists. Take particular care of your passport, avoid carrying valuables with you and do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles, even if out of sight in a locked boot.

Following an incident in September 2014, the police advise individuals against hiking alone in the forest, including at well-known recreation areas.

### **Terrorism**

There is a low threat from terrorism, but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.

### **Road Travel**

Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only purchase motor fuel at 10 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Filling a foreign car is more expensive as the purchase price does not include a government subsidy.

If you wish to drive in Brunei, we recommend that you bring your full, valid Irish driving license as well as your International Driving Permit.

Driving standards differ from Ireland. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non-use of seatbelts is common. Road conditions are generally good but you should take extra care while driving through heavy rain as road surfaces can be uneven.

If you are involved in a road accident as a driver, you should not leave the scene or move the vehicle until the police have attended.

### **Trekking**

It is easy to get lost when visiting the rainforest. Use recognised and well-known guides, and stay on the footpaths.

### **Political Situation**

Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. International news events can sometimes trigger anti-Western demonstrations. Keep yourself informed of developments, and if you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately.
