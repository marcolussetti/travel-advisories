## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Local laws reflect the fact that Brunei is an Islamic country. You should dress modestly and respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. This is especially important during the holy month of Ramadan when it is an offence to consume food, drink or tobacco in public during the fasting hours or if you intend to visit religious areas.

### **Sharia Law**

On 22 October 2013 a new Sharia criminal code was enacted. The new code sets out severe corporal penalties and punishments. From April 2019, there are further severe punishments including amputation for cases of theft and death by stoning, for sex between men or for adultery. Homosexual activity and adultery were already illegal in Brunei.

His Majesty The Sultan and other members of the Bruneian Royal Family are highly revered and public criticism of them would cause great offence. It is also an offence to criticise Islam.

Most laws under Common Law and the Sharia Criminal Code apply to all people in Brunei, regardless of nationality or religion.

Possession of pornographic material is illegal.

### **Alcohol**

The sale of alcohol in Brunei is prohibited. Non-Muslims over 17 years of age may import duty free two bottles of wine or spirits and twelve cans of beer on entry into Brunei, but must declare them to the customs authorities on arrival and consume them in private. There must be at least a 48-hour gap between each import. Keep the customs slip in case of inspection.

### **Smoking**

Smoking is prohibited in certain public places, including shopping and eating areas, bus stops and stations and government buildings. Offenders may be fined. It's difficult to buy cigarettes in Brunei and there's no duty-free allowance for tobacco or tobacco products, even for personal consumption.

### **Drugs**

There are severe penalties for drug offences in Brunei, including the death penalty.
