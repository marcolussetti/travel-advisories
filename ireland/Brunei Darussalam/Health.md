### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for Brunei.

### **Medical Facilities**

Health and medical services in Brunei are generally acceptable, though basic hospital supplies can run low from time to time. Medical evacuation to Singapore may be necessary if there are complications. Always get comprehensive medical insurance before you travel to Brunei that will cover this eventuality.

### **Mosquitoes**

Take precautions against malaria by getting up-to-date medical advice about anti-malarial medication before you travel. When you arrive, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
