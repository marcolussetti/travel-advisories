## Additional information

### **Metro**

Bucharest has a good Metro system.  It and other towns and cities are serviced by buses, trams and taxis which are very good value by western European standards.  Romania also has a good network of inter-city trains.  Motorways are not extensive.

### **Driving**

Some Romanians drive erratically and at excessive speeds and vehicles are not always fully roadworthy.  Serious road traffic accidents regularly occur.  Visitors entering Romania by road or driving there should ensure that they have adequate insurance cover.  Insurance companies or brokers should be consulted in advance about this, if necessary.  Drivers in Romania must also be in possession of a driving license and car ownership documentation.

All vehicles must pay a general road toll (see [**http://www.roviniete.ro/en**](http://www.roviniete.ro/en)).  This “Roviniete” ticket can be purchased at border points and at most petrol stations throughout Romania, and should be prominently displayed on the vehicle windscreen.

The traffic police are known to apply on-the-spot penalties for infringements of traffic regulations, including the retention of driving licences for up to three months in very serious cases.

In winter, drivers should ensure that vehicles are prepared for extreme weather conditions, including fitting mandatory winter tyres.

Roads, including primary roads, can be of poor standard, badly lit, pot-holed and with barely visible markings.  Appropriate precautions should be taken, especially at night.

There is zero tolerance for drink-driving and permitted blood/alcohol ratios are below those in Ireland.

In Romania, taxis are relatively inexpensive.  In general it is recommended that taxis are booked using one of the various methods available, rather than hailed on the street.  This is especially the case where vehicles do not have a meter or display fares.  Some visitors have reported incidents of overcharging, especially from airports and major train stations - some taxi drivers will offer a fixed price to the city centre which may appear reasonable but could be significantly in excess of the normal fares in Romania.  Visitors arriving at the airport are advised to decline any taxi offers in the arrivals area but instead to avail of one of the simple-to-use automated taxi ordering services in the arrivals hall.

### **Natural Disasters and Climate**

Romania has four distinct seasons.  Summer temperatures can rise above 40 degrees whereas winters can be very cold, with temperatures often as low as minus 20, sometimes with heavy and prolonged snowfalls.

Romania is in a seismically active zone.  The most recent serious earthquake occurred in 2011 with a magnitude of 5.5.  There were no casualties or significant damage.  The last earthquake that caused fatalities was in 1977 and while it is not an exact science it is estimated that another may be due in the current decade.
