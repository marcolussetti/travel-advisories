## Safety and security

### **Crime**

There have been some reports of credit and debit cards being scanned or stolen and used illegally, as happens elsewhere.  Use of ATMs is generally safe but some precautions should be employed, such as only using those in department stores or hotel or airport lobbies.

As would be expected in large urban locations, there are occasional reports of pickpockets and bag snatchers operating in crowded areas. Confidence scams leading to theft of passports or wallets have also been known to arise where thieves claiming to be police approach visitors and ask for ID.  The Romanian police do not generally ask people for documentation without good cause and in the event of any reason for suspicion visitors should offer to go the nearest police station.

Ideally, where they are not expected to be needed, valuables and other items such as spare jewellery, passports, driving licences, credit/debit cards and excess cash should be secured in a hotel safe.

### **Wild Animals**

Although a decreasing problem, Romania has a significant population of stray dogs.  While these do not usually pose a danger it is strongly recommended to avoid contact with them as they can be agressive and some could be rabid.

The Carpathian Mountains of Romania are famous for their wilderness and beauty but are also home to large populations of bears and wolves.  While they try to avoid humans, it is recommended when visiting remote areas to travel in groups and to take expert advice locally.

### **Metro**

Bucharest has a good Metro system.  It and other towns and cities are serviced by buses, trams and taxis which are very good value by western European standards.  Romania also has a good network of inter-city trains.  Motorways are not extensive.

### **Driving**

Some Romanians drive erratically and at excessive speeds and vehicles are not always fully roadworthy.  Serious road traffic accidents regularly occur.  Visitors entering Romania by road or driving there should ensure that they have adequate insurance cover.  Insurance companies or brokers should be consulted in advance about this, if necessary.  Drivers in Romania must also be in possession of a driving license and car ownership documentation.

All vehicles must pay a general road toll (see [**http://www.roviniete.ro/en**](http://www.roviniete.ro/en)).  This “Roviniete” ticket can be purchased at border points and at most petrol stations throughout Romania, and should be prominently displayed on the vehicle windscreen.

The traffic police are known to apply on-the-spot penalties for infringements of traffic regulations, including the retention of driving licences for up to three months in very serious cases.

In winter, drivers should ensure that vehicles are prepared for extreme weather conditions, including fitting mandatory winter tyres.

Roads, including primary roads, can be of poor standard, badly lit, pot-holed and with barely visible markings.  Appropriate precautions should be taken, especially at night.

There is zero tolerance for drink-driving and permitted blood/alcohol ratios are below those in Ireland.

In Romania, taxis are relatively inexpensive.  In general it is recommended that taxis are booked using one of the various methods available, rather than hailed on the street.  This is especially the case where vehicles do not have a meter or display fares.  Some visitors have reported incidents of overcharging, especially from airports and major train stations - some taxi drivers will offer a fixed price to the city centre which may appear reasonable but could be significantly in excess of the normal fares in Romania.  Visitors arriving at the airport are advised to decline any taxi offers in the arrivals area but instead to avail of one of the simple-to-use automated taxi ordering services in the arrivals hall.
