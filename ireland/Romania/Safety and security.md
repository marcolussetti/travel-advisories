## Safety and security

### **Crime**

There have been some reports of credit and debit cards being scanned or stolen and used illegally, as happens elsewhere.  Use of ATMs is generally safe but some precautions should be employed, such as only using those in department stores or hotel or airport lobbies.

As would be expected in large urban locations, there are occasional reports of pickpockets and bag snatchers operating in crowded areas. Confidence scams leading to theft of passports or wallets have also been known to arise where thieves claiming to be police approach visitors and ask for ID.  The Romanian police do not generally ask people for documentation without good cause and in the event of any reason for suspicion visitors should offer to go the nearest police station.

Ideally, where they are not expected to be needed, valuables and other items such as spare jewellery, passports, driving licences, credit/debit cards and excess cash should be secured in a hotel safe.

### **Water**

While the water supply in Romania is not known to be contaminated, use of bottled or filtered water is recommended as a safer option.

### **Wild Animals**

Although a decreasing problem, Romania has a significant population of stray dogs.  While these do not usually pose a danger it is strongly recommended to avoid contact with them as they can be agressive and some could be rabid.

The Carpathian Mountains of Romania are famous for their wilderness and beauty but are also home to large populations of bears and wolves.  While they try to avoid humans, it is recommended when visiting remote areas to travel in groups and to take expert advice locally.
