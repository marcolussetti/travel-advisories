#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Bucharest for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

#### **Ukraine War**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine together with our EU and other international partners.  Please find current travel advice in relation to Ukraine [**here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Romania. Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish nationals do not require visas for visits to Romania. However, those that intend to stay there for longer than 90 days must register with the [**Romanian Authority for Immigration**](http://www.mai.gov.ro/).

Please note that Romania has been accepted into the Schengen area, with air and sea border controls to be lifted from 31 March, 2024.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbBuch**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbBuch) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyBucharest)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts. Irish visitors to Romania are encouraged to [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy.

The official currency in Romania is the RON, often called Lei. Obtaining RON prior to travel can be difficult. However, on arrival cash can be withdrawn from ATMs.

Visitors to Romania are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
