### **Latest Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine together with our EU and other international partners.  Please find current travel advice in relation to Ukraine [**here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Romania. Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish nationals do not require visas for visits to Romania. However, those that intend to stay there for longer than 90 days must register with the [**Romanian Authority for Immigration**](http://www.mai.gov.ro/).

Please note that Romania has been accepted into the Schengen area, with air and sea border controls to be lifted from 31 March, 2024.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbBuch**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbBuch) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyBucharest)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts. Irish visitors to Romania are encouraged to [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy.

The official currency in Romania is the RON, often called Lei. Obtaining RON prior to travel can be difficult. However, on arrival cash can be withdrawn from ATMs.

Visitors to Romania are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
