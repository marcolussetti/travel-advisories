## Health

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. We advise you to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel.

Medical facilities in Niue are limited. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to New Zealand is likely to be the only option for treatment. Make sure your insurance policy includes provision for medical evacuation and covers you for all eventualities.

### **Health risks**

There is a risk of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue. You should take steps to avoid mosquito bites.

Ciguatera is an illness caused by eating fish containing certain toxins. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes and sometimes serious illness. There is no way to tell whether fish has been contaminated, but reef fish tend to concentrate the toxins more than others. Deep water fish like tuna, mahi mahi or wahoo are better options.

### **Water**

Boiling water and only drinking bottled water is strongly recommended.
