## Safety and security

### **Petty Crime**

Crime in Niue is low but petty crime can occur.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Niue:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public. There are no ATMs in Niue but some businesses offer cashback. The New Zealand dollar is used.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Demonstrations**

Public gatherings and demonstrations may take place from time to time.

We recommend that you stay clear of demonstrations, and should follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **Swimming**

Swimming, snorkelling and diving are common activities. Take local advice before swimming as fatal accidents can occur at popular beaches.

At certain times of the year, some beaches in Niue are closed for traditional fishing activities.

### **Road Travel**

You must apply for a local driving licence from the Niue Police Department.

Driving is on the left. You should avoid driving at night out of built-up areas. Vehicle safety regulations are not consistently enforced. Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.
