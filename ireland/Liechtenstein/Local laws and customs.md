## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Drug possession carries heavy fines and prison terms in Liechtenstein. They can vary depending on the amount and type of narcotics involved.

### **Alcohol**

The drinking age for beer, wine and alcoholic cider is generally 16 (though higher in some cantons or individual shops), while the age for any other alcohol (e.g. spirits, alcopops, etc.) is 18.
