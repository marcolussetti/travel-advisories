## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

Liechtenstein has a continental climate, influenced by the Alps.Â Cold and dry northerly winds can make temperatures drop very quickly, even in clear weather.

### **Avalanches**

Avalanches, snow drifts, flash floods and mudslides are a danger in Alpine areas. The weather in these regions is unpredictable and can change suddenly. If traveling to alpine areas, monitor local weather and safety conditions, follow advice from local authorities, equip yourself appropriately, plan activities carefully and inform someone of your plans. Also observe all written warnings and notices and stick to marked slopes and trails.
