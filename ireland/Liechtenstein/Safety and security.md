## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

Protests and demonstrations do take place in Liechtenstein. These are often aimed at international organisations and international meetings. Some protests have become violent in the past. Monitor the local media and other important sources of information about possible demonstrations, avoid affected areas and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Terrorism**

Along with other European countries, there is potential for Liechtenstein to experience international terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

The level of serious crime in Liechtenstein is relatively low and most visits to the country will be trouble free. However, always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Be aware that petty theft does take place in Liechtenstein, especially around main train stations, filling stations, on public transport, at airports and in city centre areas.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Liechtenstein, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Berne if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Liechtenstein, exercise the same caution as when driving in Ireland. If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driverâ€™s licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught

### **Traffic offences**

Liechtenstein traffic regulations are strictly enforced and any serious breach of the rules, particularly in the case of driving under the influence of alcohol, can result in heavy fines, loss of license and/or imprisonment.

Speeding is taken very seriously and breaking the speed limit could result in a hefty fine, which can be sent to you even after you have left the country. If the fine is unpaid you may have difficulties when entering/leaving Liechtenstein.

### **Winter equipment**

All cars must be fitted with winter tyres when driving in Liechtenstein during the winter months. Snow chains may also be required for mountainous routes.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
