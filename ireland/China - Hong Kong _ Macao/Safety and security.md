## Safety and security

### **Political situation**

Hong Kong and Macao are generally stable societies.

Irish citizens and members of the public are urged to be vigilant and are strongly advised to avoid areas where protests and unplanned public gatherings are taking place and to follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **National Security Legislation**

National Security Legislation has been in place in Hong Kong since July 2020. It covers offences on secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with a foreign country or an external force with mandatory penalties up to and including life imprisonment depending on the severity of the charges.

Charges under this legislation can be applied to activities undertaken inside and outside Hong Kong. Possession of materials considered to be seditious, flying of drones in unauthorised areas or other activities while in Hong Kong may result in arrest or detention.

Irish citizens are reminded that local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Travellers should make themselves familiar with the [Safeguarding National Security Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/A305). Irish citizens have a right to request consular assistance if they are detained by local authorities.

### **Terrorism**

There is an underlying global threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. The Hong Kong and Macao governments have put in place extensive measures to combat terrorism including upgraded police capability, improved air travel security, improved border controls and upgraded emergency services response.

### **Crime**

The incidence of violent crime is very low but some street crime and pick pocketing can occur as in any large urban area. Extra care should be taken in crowded areas in respect of passports, money and credit cards â€“ stay vigilant in train stations and markets.

If a victim of a crime while in Hong Kong or Macao report it to the local police immediately. The Crime Report numbers are as follows:

* 999 for Hong Kong
* 993 for Macao

[**Hong Kong Police**](https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/) operate an 'e-Report Centre' which is designed for non-emergency report or enquiry. Instant response to the report or enquiry will not be available. In case of emergency, please call 999 or contact the nearest police station.

The Tourism Crisis Management Office (+853) 2833 3000 (24-hour hotline) are able to provide general assistance in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese to tourists in Macao. In case of emergency, please call 993 or contact the nearest police station. A leaflet to assist with understanding the crime reporting procedures can be found [**here**](https://www.pj.gov.mo/Web/u/cms/www/pdf/Publish/EN/RC03.pdf).

Visitors can contact the Consulate General of Ireland if assistance is required.

### **Public Transport/Driving**

Hong Kong is renowned for its safe, affordable and reliable public transport system, including ferry, rail, bus and tram.

The [**Octopus Card**](https://www.octopus.com.hk/en/consumer/index.html) is a stored-value electronic card that can be used for most public transport, as well as purchases in convenience stores, fast food shops, supermarkets, cake shops, vending machines and more.

The high-speed Airport Express takes approximately 24 minutes to reach Hong Kong Island and is the fastest way to get between the city and the airport. Airport Express passengers are able to take a free shuttle bus from Kowloon and Hong Kong stations to major hotels.

The Macao authorities consider the taxi service Uber to be illegal, and the Macao Police has recently been taking enforcement action against both the drivers and passengers of unlicensed taxi services, including Uber.

For holders of an Irish driving licence who wish to drive in Hong Kong, you may do so on the strength of a valid Irish driving licence or international driving permit if a visitor to Hong Kong (visitors mean that you arrive in Hong Kong other than to take up residence for a period not exceeding 12 months).

Holders of an Irish driving licence who wish to drive in Macao and who are staying for less than a year must go to the police station to obtain an official paper to legalise your Irish licence.

### **Lost or stolen passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen while in Hong Kong or Macao the Consulate General of Ireland in Hong Kong can in emergency situations issue an emergency travel document. A completed application must be submitted, duly witnessed and with all supporting documents and the appropriate fee. Proof of identity and citizenship will be required, including an original or certified long-form birth certificate in all cases.
