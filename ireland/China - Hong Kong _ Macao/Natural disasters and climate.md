## Natural disasters and climate

Hong Kong and Macao have a sub-tropical climate with distinct seasons. The only predictable weather events that could have a significant impact on travel plans are typhoons and rainstorms. Typhoon season begins in May and ends in November.

When a typhoon is approaching, warnings are broadcast on television and radio and many buildings display the typhoon warning signal. Public offices shut down when the ‘Typhoon 8’ signal is hoisted and people are required to be indoors until the Typhoon passes.
