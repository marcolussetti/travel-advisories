## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR and mainland China maintain separate customs and immigration boundaries under the “One Country, Two Systems” governance arrangements. Passports and appropriate visas are required for travelling between the territories. Travelling between Hong Kong, Macao or China and returning to one of the territories constitutes a multiple journey.

To enter Hong Kong and Macao you must possess a passport that is valid for at least one month beyond the date of your intended stay, adequate funds to cover your stay and evidence of onward/return transportation. Many neighbouring areas require that Irish passports are valid for at least six months before they will allow entry, so if planning on regional travel beyond Hong Kong, make sure that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond the date you plan to enter such areas.  Irish citizens do not need a visa for tourist visits of up to 90 days but a visa may be required if travel is other than for tourism purposes. Details on general visa requirements can be found below:
