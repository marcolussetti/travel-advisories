## Local laws and customs

### **Hong Kong Local Laws**

Hong Kong law, like Ireland, is a common law system with criminal and civil law codes.

Some of the city’s public hygiene rules and laws include:

* Prohibition of eating and drinking on most public transport in Hong Kong;
* Strict laws about maintaining environmental hygiene, including fixed penalty fines for littering or spitting.

There is also a zero tolerance for ticketless travel on the Mass Transit Railway (MTR).

The import and re-export of all elephant ivory and its products, including tourist souvenirs, is banned. Offenders could face a fine and/or imprisonment.

Photographing of military installations is prohibited.

The Hong Kong SAR Government has restrictions in place on the quantity of powdered baby formula allowed for persons departing the territory. Penalties apply for non-compliance.

### **Smoking restrictions, including e-cigarettes**

Smoking, including e-cigarettes, is prohibited in all indoor public places in Hong Kong and Macao, including restaurants, bars and malls. The smoking ban is also implemented on public transport carriers, within public transport facilities, and in both the indoor and outdoor areas of some premises, including public beaches and swimming pools and escalators.

Any person smoking or carrying a lighted cigarette, cigar, or pipe in a designated no-smoking area will be liable to a fixed penalty.

Hong Kong has banned the import, sale and manufacture of electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes, with offenders subject to a maximum fine of HK$50,000 (US$6,370) and six months’ imprisonment. Consumers are still allowed to smoke vape gadgets.

If entering Hong Kong with e-cigarettes containing nicotine, a medical prescription indicating that they’re for personal use is required. If the e-cigarette is nicotine-free and for personal use, no medical prescription is needed.

### **Macao Local Laws**

Macao is a civil law system, in that legislation is the main source of law and case law, while clearly relevant, is not a major source of law. Macao has the five 'classic' codifications: the Civil Code, the Commercial Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Penal Code, and the Criminal Procedure Code. Proceedings will be conducted in Portuguese.

### **Security restricted articles**

Hong Kong and Macao have strict laws regarding the import and/or possession of any type of weapon and items that may resemble weapons, including replicas, antiques, toys and fashion accessories.

The laws apply to individuals in Hong Kong and Macao and those transiting Hong Kong and Macao airports, and apply to hand luggage, checked luggage and luggage in transit. For further information, please see the websites of:
