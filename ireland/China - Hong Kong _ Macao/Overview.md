Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Hong Kong or Macao for the purposes of tourism.

A valid passport is required for travel to Hong Kong or Macao. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used. Irish passports should be valid for at least one month after the date of your departure from Hong Kong.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.

Visitors to Hong Kong or Macao are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow Consulate General of Ireland in Hong Kong on social media (Twitter[**@ IrelandinHK**](https://twitter.com/IrelandinHK)and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrelandinHK/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **National Security Law**

National Security Legislation has been in place in Hong Kong since July 2020. It covers offences on secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with a foreign country or an external force with mandatory penalties up to and including life imprisonment depending on the severity of the charges.

Charges under this legislation can be applied to activities undertaken inside and outside Hong Kong. Possession of materials considered to be seditious, flying of drones in unauthorised areas or other activities while in Hong Kong may result in arrest or detention.

Irish citizens are reminded that local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Travellers should make themselves familiar with the [**Safeguarding National Security** Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/A305). Irish citizens have a right to request consular assistance if they are detained by local authorities.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Hong Kong or Macao by dialling 999.
