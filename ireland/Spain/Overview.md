### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Spain.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Spain. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you have to register in person at the Oficina de Extranjeros (Foreigners Office). See the ‘Additional Information’ tab for further information.

Irish passport holders, as EU citizens, will not be affected by the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) or the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). These systems refer to the travel of non-EU citizens. General information on the introduction of the EES and the ETIAS can be found on the [**European Union website**](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/index_en).

Visitors to Spain are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy [**on X @IrlEmbMadrid**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbMadrid) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### Emergency Assistance

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Spain by dialling 112. The operators speak English, and will be able to assist you.
