## Additional information

### **Passports**

You need a passport to enter Spain. While there is no minimum passport validity requirement, your passport must be valid for the planned period of your stay.

### **Staying for longer than three months**

All EU citizens who want to stay in Spain for more than three months have to register in person at the Oficina de Extranjeros (Foreigners Office). You will be issued a Certificate of Registration with your name, address, nationality, identity number (NIE) and date of registration. The certificate serves as confirmation that you have registered, but is not recognised by the local authorities as a valid form of identification.

### **Consular help**

You can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy**](/en/spain/madrid/) in Madrid or one of Ireland's [**Honorary Consulates**](/en/dfa/embassies/) if you need help.

### **Transport**

#### **Driving**

You drive on the right in Spain. The rules of the road in Spain are broadly similar to those in Ireland, and roads are modern and well maintained. Traffic is faster-paced than in Ireland and driving customs are different. You should exercise particular caution while driving at night. If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Be aware of Spain’s traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Wear your seatbelts at all times, in front and back seats
* Children under 135cm in height must use an approved child safety seat secured on the rear seats of the vehicle;
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights
* The use of a mobile phone without a hands-free device can result in a fine and driving ban while in Spain
* You must wear a reflective vest and use a reflective triangle warning signs if you need to stop at the roadside

### **If travelling between Gibraltar and Spain**

Vehicles (both cars and motorcycles) may experience significant delays when entering Spain from Gibraltar and sometimes vice versa.  Take water and extra food with you during the hot summer months and wear warm clothing in winter.  It is possible to park cars in La Línea in Spain and walk across the border, and this can help to avoid the worst of the queues. While parking in La Línea immediately next to the border incurs charges, check for free parking throughout the town and next to the stadium (this is an extra kilometre of walking). This also has the advantage of avoiding Gibraltar's complex one way system, very narrow streets, and limited parking.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Driving an HGV**

Lorry drivers should be aware that fines relating to tachometer and other irregularities are strictly enforced by the Spanish police. These fines are very severe and must be paid either on the spot or by bank transfer. The latter can be done directly or by the haulage company’s Spanish agent, if they have one. Once payment is made, the vehicle will be allowed to continue. A form for appeal is given with the receipt.
