#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Madrid, or nearest Consulate, for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

#### **Train Accident**

On 18 January, 2026, two high‑speed trains were involved in an accident near Adamuz, in Córdoba in Andalusia.

Significant disruptions to rail services are ongoing. Trains travelling to the south of Spain are particularly affected. Citizens are advised to consult their travel operator.

#### **Weather Warnings**

Weather warnings, including extreme weather warnings, can affect many of areas of Spain all year round.

You can monitor information and alerts on the website of the Spanish Meteorological Agency, [**AEMET**](https://www.aemet.es/en/portada).

In the event of a weather warning, citizens should consult their travel provider and follow the instructions of the local authorities.

### General Travel Advice

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Spain.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Spain. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you have to register in person at the Oficina de Extranjeros (Foreigners Office). See the ‘Entry requirements’ tab for further information.

Irish passport holders, as EU citizens, will not be affected by the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) or the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). These systems refer to the travel of non-EU citizens. General information on the introduction of the EES and the ETIAS can be found on the [**European Union website**](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/index_en).

Visitors to Spain are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy [**on X @IrlEmbMadrid**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbMadrid) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### Emergency Assistance

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Spain by dialling 112. The operators speak English, and will be able to assist you.
