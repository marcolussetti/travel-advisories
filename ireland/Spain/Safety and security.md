## Safety and security

### **Demonstrations**

Public gatherings and demonstrations  can at times take place with little or no warning. We recommend that you stay clear of demonstrations and follow the advice of the local authorities.

Protests may cause disruption to transport and other services. Be prepared to adjust your travel plans at short notice if necessary, and allow yourself extra time for your journey. You should also check for travel updates or transport delays before and during your trip to Spain.

### **Terrorism**

There is a general threat from terrorism in Europe, and the threat in Spain is considered to be high. [Spanish Government’s national anti-terror alert level](https://www.interior.gob.es/opencms/es/prensa/nivel-alerta-terrorista/) is currently at level four (high) on a scale of 1 to 5.

As terrorists could attempt further attacks, and such attacks could include places visited by foreigners, Irish citizens are advised to increase their security awareness and exercise heightened caution. In the event of any security incident, you should follow the instructions of the local police and your tour operator.

### **Safety on balconies**

There have been a number of serious accidents in recent years involving falls from balconies.  Several of these have resulted in the death or serious injury of an Irish citizen. It is important to exercise caution when using hotel and apartment balconies, particularly if you have consumed alcohol or drugs, and to avoid taking unnecessary risks. If you suffer a balcony fall while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, your insurance company may refuse to cover any resultant costs. You should also be aware that the Spanish authorities may impose fines on those engaged in risky behaviour on balconies, including climbing over them or jumping from them.

### **Crime**

Most of Spain has a moderate rate of crime. However, given the very high number of holidaymakers that visit Spain, additional security measures are rolled out in public areas at peak times, such as during the summer and at Christmas. You should be aware that in areas such as airports, bus stations, railway stations, tourist areas and major cities such as Madrid and Barcelona, there is a much higher risk of pickpocketing and muggings. We advise you to take basic precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets, passport and money together in the same place, for example your luggage or bag. Leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary, and consider carrying your Passport Card. Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as cafes, train and bus stations, bars, restaurants, etc.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible

### **Petty crime**

Be vigilant about petty crime: many of the cases we encounter involve stolen passports and credit cards.

In metro stations, avoid boarding the train near the exit/entrance to the platform, as this is often where pickpockets position themselves. Thieves may work in teams and a person may attempt to distract you so that an accomplice can rob you more easily.

### **Road crime**

Always be cautious when approached by anyone claiming to be a police officer, either in plain clothes or travelling in unmarked vehicles.

In all traffic matters, police officers will be in uniform. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window, which reads ‘Policía’ or ‘Guardia Civil’, and normally have blue flashing lights incorporated into the headlights.

In non-traffic matters, police officers may be in plain clothes. However, you have the right to ask a police officer to identify themselves. Also, a genuine police officer will not request that you hand over your bag or wallet. If they ask you for identification, show them photographic ID such as your passport, Passport Card or driver's licence. If in any doubt, you should converse through the car window and contact the Spanish authorities on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.

### **Vehicle crime**

Theft from vehicles is common in Spain. Remember to keep your doors locked, windows rolled up and valuables out of sight while driving.

Be aware of 'highway pirates' who target foreign-registered and rental cars.There have been reports of such activity in the vicinity of airports, in particular. Some will try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. In some cases, they will even deliberately orchestrate a collision in order to get you to stop and exit your car, before stealing personal belongings from you.

If you decide to stop to check the condition of your/their vehicle, try to stop in an area with lights and people, such as a service station, and be extremely wary of anyone offering help.

### **Date rape drugs**

The Spanish authorities have warned of date rape drugs, including GBH and liquid ecstasy, being used. Don’t inadvertently lower your alertness to these risks simply because you are on holiday.

### 

### **Police**

There are two main police forces in Spain:

* The Policía Nacional (National Police) is the nationwide metropolitan police agency of Spain. It deals with criminal, judicial, terrorism and immigration matters. They can be contacted by dialling 091.
* The Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) operates mainly in rural areas. It has both military and civilian functions. They can be contacted by dialling 062.

In most urban areas, there is also the Policia Local (dial 092), which is responsible for traffic inside the cities and minor crime.

### **Reporting a crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Spain, report it to the local police immediately by calling the emergency services on 112 - responding operators all speak English.

Make sure you get a copy of the ‘**denuncia**’ (police report) when you report the crime. For example, if you’ve had belongings stolen, you’ll need the police report for insurance purposes. If your passport is lost or stolen, keep the police report for your insurance claim, to apply for an emergency travel certificate and to apply for a replacement passport when you return to Ireland.

### **Making a police report**

You can make a police report either:

1. **In person:** At the nearest police station. English language interpreters are not always available at short notice so you should consider bringing a Spanish-speaking person with you.

2.**Online:**You can also make a [**police report online**](https://denuncias.policia.es/OVD/?lang=en_GB). Some crimes, especially more serious crimes involving physical violence, must be reported in person.

### **Climate: seasonal risks**

#### **Wildfires**

During dry periods or periods of high temperatures, there is a risk of forest fires in many parts of Spain. These can result in road and railway closures. In addition, air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate and adversely affect travellers, particularly those with respiratory ailments. Irish citizens should monitor the news closely as the situation can change quickly, and take particular care to avoid engaging in any action that may contribute to the risk of forest fires when outdoors.

If you see a fire or smoke, you are advised to call the emergency number 112. The operators speak English, and will be able to assist you. Up-to-date information on the current situation in relation to forest fires is available on the [**website of the Department of Civil Protection and Emergencies**](https://www.proteccioncivil.es/es/inicio)and on their [**social media channels.**](https://twitter.com/proteccioncivil)

**Volcanos & seismic activity**

On 19 September 2021, there was a volcanic eruption on the Canary Island of La Palma in the El Paso municipality. There is currently a ‘yellow’ alert in place. Information on affected areas is available on the [**Government of La Palma website**](https://riesgovolcanico-lapalma.hub.arcgis.com/). (Spanish only)

Information in English on the recommendations to the public during a volcanic eruption is available on the website of the [**https://riesgovolcanico-lapalma.hub.arcgis.com/pages/recomendaciones**](https://riesgovolcanico-lapalma.hub.arcgis.com/pages/recomendaciones)

Spain can experience volcanic and seismic activity, particularly in the Canary Islands. However, major events are rare. The Government of the Canary Islands monitors such activity closely and provides updated information for the public on their [**website**](https://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/principal/).
