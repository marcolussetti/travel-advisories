## Natural disasters and climate

### **Wildfires**

During dry periods or periods of high temperatures, there is a risk of forest fires in many parts of Spain. These can result in road and railway closures. In addition, air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate and adversely affect travellers, particularly those with respiratory ailments. Irish citizens should monitor the news closely as the situation can change quickly, and take particular care to avoid engaging in any action that may contribute to the risk of forest fires when outdoors.

If you see a fire or smoke, you are advised to call the emergency number 112. The operators speak English, and will be able to assist you.
