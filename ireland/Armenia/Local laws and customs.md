## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to travellers and it is their responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Religion**

Armenia is an orthodox Christian country and women can usually dress in normal western-style clothing, although they may be expected to cover their heads when in Church. Outside the capital however, people are more conservative.

### **Photography**

Avoid photographing sites such as military bases, equipment and installations in whatever condition. These are considered sensitive areas and visitors have been detained and questioned while attempting to photograph them.

Visitors should also be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites. If in doubt, ask permission.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality was decriminalised in August 2003 but it is still an unacceptable lifestyle for the majority of Armenians. We advise travellers to exercise discretion on visits to Armenia.

### **Banking**

Cheques are not used inÂ Armenia. Prices for goods and services are often quoted in US Dollars, but by law, payment must be made in the Armenian Dram. Many ATMs can be found in the cities and most towns. Foreign currency exchanges are also available in branches of the major banks, exchange bureaus and in some supermarkets. We recommend avoiding exchanging money on the street.
