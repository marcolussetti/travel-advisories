## Health

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical facilities outside Yerevan are generally poor and treatment is not recommended for anything other than minor ailments. In case of medical need and for advice and assistance contact the Irish Honorary Consul in Yerevan.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Armenia.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Embassy cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. An appropriate travel insurance policy should cover these costs provided travellers have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that travellers get the medical attention you need when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that travellers purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you are sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities planned that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
