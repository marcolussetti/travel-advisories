### **Earthquakes**

Armenia is in an active seismic zone. The last serious earthquake, in 1988, was centred in the Lori region in the north, killing between 25,000 and 50,000 people, injuring thousands and leaving several cities in ruins. Always follow the instructions of local authorities in case of an emergency.
