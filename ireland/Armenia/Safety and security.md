## Safety and security

### **Border areas**

The border with Azerbaijan remains closed.

Armenia’s land border with Turkey is closed.

Irish citizens are advised not to travel to Nagorno Karabakh.

### **Demonstrations**

Irish citizens should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people if at all possible. Political demonstrations may take place in central Yerevan, particularly close to the Opera Square, and in other cities and towns around the country.

Sometimes such demonstrations, even if intended to be peaceful, can turn confrontational. If it is necessary to be in the vicinity of a demonstration or gatherings, be extremely vigilant at all times.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Armenia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Armenia but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry a passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of the  
   passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to the hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

If a victim of a crime while in Armenia, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Sofia or the Irish Honorary Consul in Yerevan if help is needed.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Armenia, be extremely careful. Roads outside the principal cities can be bad and the local standard of driving is poor, with drivers commonly flouting traffic laws. Driving in Armenia is on the right-hand side of the road.

If driving, bring a full Irish licence and international driving permit and make sure adequate and appropriate insurance is purchased.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise travellers not to hand over passports as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in sight at all times.

Check that adequate insurance is purchased and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged)..

### **Public transport**

Public transport tends to be crowded and poorly maintained. Buses run at irregular times and may be difficult to negotiate if travellers do not speak Armenian or Russian.

### **Taxis**

Taxis are relatively cheap and accessible in Yerevan. They can be hailed easily on the street. Check that the meter is running. If there is no meter, negotiate a price for the journey before you start. Average prices for journeys in the city centre are in the region of 500-1000 dram.

### **Air safety**

We recommend flying to Armenia on a scheduled international flight. Western airlines currently serving Armenia include Aegean, Air France, Austrian Airlines and LOT.
