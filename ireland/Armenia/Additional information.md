## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

EU passport holders no longer require a visa to visit Armenia. The entrance stamp is valid for a period of 90 days only.

Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months, but preferably 6 months from date of entry and also should be valid for entire stay in Armenia.

If intending to stay in Armenia longer than 90 days, travellers must register with the OVIR (Administration Department for Passports and Visas):

Address: Mashtots Ave. 13A,

Yerevan,

Armenia

Tel: 00 374 10 536 932/ 941

### **Travelling with children**

Dual national passport holders entering Armenia using their Armenian passport and travelling with children on an Irish passport should be aware of Armenian nationality law before entering the country. Children arriving on an Irish passport with parents entering on an Armenian passport will require an Armenian passport to leave the country.

Under Armenian law, a child of an Armenian passport holder is automatically regarded as Armenian. This can have implications if applying for visa extensions or when leaving Armenia, as the Armenian authorities may request that an Armenian passport be produced. It may particularly affect men of military age who have not carried out their compulsory Armenian military service.

### **Banking**

Cheques are not used inÂ  Armenia. Prices for goods and services are often quoted in US Dollars, but by law, payment must be made in the Armenian Dram. Many ATMs can be found in the cities and most towns. Foreign currency exchanges are also available in branches of the major banks, exchange bureaus and in some supermarkets. We recommend avoiding exchanging money on the street.

### **Earthquakes**

Armenia is in an active seismic zone. The last serious earthquake, in 1988, was centred in the Lori region in the north, killing between 25,000 and 50,000 people, injuring thousands and leaving several cities in ruins. Always follow the instructions of local authorities in case of an emergency.
