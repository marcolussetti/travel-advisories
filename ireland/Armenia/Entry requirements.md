## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

EU passport holders no longer require a visa to visit Armenia. The entrance stamp is valid for a period of 90 days only.

### **Passport**

Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 3 months, but preferably 6 months from date of entry and also should be valid for entire stay in Armenia.

### **Staying for Longer than Three Months**

If intending to stay in Armenia longer than 90 days, travellers must register with the OVIR (Administration Department for Passports and Visas):

Address: Mashtots Ave. 13A,

Yerevan,

Armenia

Tel: 00 374 10 536 932/ 941

### **Travelling with Children**

Dual national passport holders entering Armenia using their Armenian passport and travelling with children on an Irish passport should be aware of Armenian nationality law before entering the country. Children arriving on an Irish passport with parents entering on an Armenian passport will require an Armenian passport to leave the country.

Under Armenian law, a child of an Armenian passport holder is automatically regarded as Armenian. This can have implications if applying for visa extensions or when leaving Armenia, as the Armenian authorities may request that an Armenian passport be produced. It may particularly affect men of military age who have not carried out their compulsory Armenian military service.
