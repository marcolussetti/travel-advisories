## Safety and security

### **Security Operations**

Security operations are ongoing and Jamaican authorities may impose a State of Emergency or other measures, including curfews, with little or no notice. Visitors must be cautious when travelling to affected areas, particularly at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. Security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures, and detain persons of interest when a state of emergency is in effect. This may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.

### **Social Unrest**

Impromptu demonstrations can take place in non-tourist areas of the inner city of Kingston. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational. Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Crime**

The capital of Jamaica, Kingston, is prone to high levels of crime and violence, including kidnapping. Always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations.
* Avoid West Kingston and inner city areas.
* The motive for attacks on tourists is usually robbery. In such cases, do not attempt to resist.
* Avoid walking through the city at night, and avoid walking alone at any time.

Gang violence is not uncommon in Jamaica, with some inner city areas being particularly affected. Jamaican authorities can put emergency security measures in place to deal with outbreaks of violence or gang shootings, called a State of Emergency (SOE) or Zone of Special Operations (ZOSOs). When imposed, an SOE or ZOSO can result in curfews, cordons, searching of persons, vehicles, and places within a specific area. Tourist areas are not usually affected by gang-related crime and violence, though caution should be used when travelling through the following areas;

* Kingston
* Spanish Town
* Savanna-la-Mar
* parts of Montego Bay including Flankers, Barrett Town, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem

### **Petty Theft**

Beware of pickpockets, muggers and bag snatchers, especially in areas where large numbers of people crowd together. We recommend to stay in established hotels away from the inner city.

### **Lost or Stolen passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen, you need to report it immediately to the police. Getting a replacement passport will be easier if you are able to provide a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies of your passport.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Jamaica, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact [**the Honorary Consulate in Kingston**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) or the [**Irish Embassy in Ottawa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/canada/ottawa/).

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Jamaica, visitors should be careful as there is a high rate of road traffic accidents. Traffic in Jamaica keeps to the left as in Ireland, however much of the road network, especially outside the main cities, is in a poor state of repair. If visitors want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.

### **Taxis**

Avoid public buses and only use taxis regulated by the Jamaica Union of Travellers Association and ordered from a hotel for your sole use. Negotiate the taxi fare before departing your destination.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

### **Hurricane Season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. Visitors should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).
