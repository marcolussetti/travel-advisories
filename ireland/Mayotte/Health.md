Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Chikungunya Virus**

Cases of Chikungunya continue to occur in Mayotte since an outbreak in 2025. There is also a risk of locally-acquired (autochthonous) malaria. Protect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.

Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/).

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for travel to Mayotte.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
