## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Mayotte is an Overseas Department of France and part of the European Union.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Mayotte.

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Mayotte.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Mayotte and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.

We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Mayotte there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

You should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise you on the fees which apply.
