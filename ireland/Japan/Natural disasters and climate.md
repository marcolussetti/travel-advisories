## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes and tsunamis**

Japan is in a very active earthquake zone and earthquakes of various sizes occur frequently throughout the country. Irish citizens travelling to or resident in Japan should familiarise themselves with the measures to take in the event of an earthquake.

Travellers to Japan should consider downloading the Japan Tourism Agency’s [“Safety Tips”](https://www.jnto.go.jp/safety-tips/eng/app.html) app to receive notifications of natural disasters and advice (in English) while in Japan.

### **Restrictions around the Fukushima nuclear power plant**

The 2011 earthquake and tsunami severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture. The Japanese authorities implemented exclusion zones around the plant, and illegally entering these zones is a punishable offence. Further information on these areas can be seen on this Japanese government [**website**](http://www.pref.fukushima.lg.jp/site/portal-english/en-1-3-3.html). The Japanese authorities carry out comprehensive monitoring of possible contamination of water and food and are imposing strict controls where necessary. The situation has stabilised, although it will take decades to decommission and decontaminate the plant.

Elsewhere in the north-east of Japan, the situation has largely returned to normal and there is no reason to avoid or postpone travel to this region.

### **Typhoons**

The Japanese typhoon season runs from June to October, with the period between August and September seeing the most typhoon activity. Typhoons that hit Japan are often accompanied by high tides and landslides that can occur anywhere during continuous periods of heavy rain.

Travellers to Japan (particularly southern regions) should pay attention to local travel information and consult the [**Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA),**](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/) which provides information in English. Visitors should also check with airlines or transport operator before travelling.

### **Volcanoes**

Japan has several active volcanoes. Follow advice given by the Japanese authorities about travelling in volcanic areas. Please check latest volcano warnings on the website of the [**Japanese Meteorological Agency**](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/volcano/).
