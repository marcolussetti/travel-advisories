## Additional information

### **Passports**

Passports should be valid for the duration of stay in Japan. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.

### **Visas**

A visa waiver agreement between Ireland and Japan is currently in force and Irish citizens seeking to enter Japan for a short stay of up to 90 days (extendable up to 6 months on application within Japan) may do so without first obtaining a visa in advance. However, if Irish citizens wish to enter Japan to take up employment, exercise a profession or other occupation, or engage in public entertainment (including sport) for remunerative purposes, or if they wish to enter for a period longer than 6 months, they will need to obtain a visa in advance of travel though the [**Embassy of Japan in Ireland**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/).

Irish citizens with Status of Residence in Japan and who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are allowed to re-enter Japan subject to entry requirements.

Further information on current entry restrictions can be found in the Overview section of this Travel Advice. For full information, please consult the website of the [**VISA | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (mofa.go.jp)**](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html)**.**

Information on extension of short term stays in Japan and other immigration matters can be found on the website of the [**Immigration Services Agency of Japan**](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/index.html)**.**

### **Information on Entry Requirements**

In accordance with a partial amendment to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, from November 2007, all foreign visitors entering Japan will be fingerprinted and digitally photographed during entry procedures.

Those refusing to be fingerprinted or photographed will be denied entry to Japan. Persons under the age of 16, special status permanent residents and those performing actions which would be performed by those with a status of residence, "diplomat" or "official government business" will be exempt from these procedures.

For specific travel health advice relating to Japan, including on vaccinations, we would advise those travelling to Japan to contact their GP or travel clinic. Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if vaccinations for Japan are required.

### **Medication**

There are restrictions on the importation of some over-the-counter and prescription medicines and this may include certain types of allergy and sinus medication. If a visit to a doctor is required, there are a number of clinics with English-speaking personnel who widely advertise their services. However, it may not be possible to obtain the same brand-name medication that is available in Ireland.

### **Language schools**

There are numerous English language schools in Japan recruiting teachers from overseas. The Department strongly advises job applicants to scrutinise the details of the terms and conditions of their prospective contracts and of their prospective agency/ employer, in order to ensure that they are fully satisfied of the good standing of those agencies/employers and that their conditions of employment will be met.

### **Cash and banking**

We advise visitors to contact their financial institution in advance of travelling to Japan to check cards will be valid upon arrival as some visitors experience difficulties accessing funds using cash cards issued in Ireland. It is advisable for visitors to have an alternative means with which to access funds should such situations arise (e.g. a credit card with a cash advance facility or travellers' cheques).
