### **Vaccinations**

For specific travel health advice relating to Japan, including on vaccinations, we would advise those travelling to Japan to contact their GP or travel clinic. Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if vaccinations for Japan are required.

### **Medication**

There are restrictions on the importation of some over-the-counter and prescription medicines and this may include certain types of allergy and sinus medication. If a visit to a doctor is required, there are a number of clinics with English-speaking personnel who widely advertise their services. However, it may not be possible to obtain the same brand-name medication that is available in Ireland.
