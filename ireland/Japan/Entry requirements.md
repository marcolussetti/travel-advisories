## Entry requirements

### **Passports**

Passports should be valid for the duration of stay in Japan. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.

### **Visas**

A visa waiver agreement between Ireland and Japan is currently in force and Irish citizens seeking to enter Japan for a short stay of up to 90 days (extendable up to 6 months on application within Japan) may do so without first obtaining a visa in advance. However, if Irish citizens wish to enter Japan to take up employment, exercise a profession or other occupation, or engage in public entertainment (including sport) for remunerative purposes, or if they wish to enter for a period longer than 6 months, they will need to obtain a visa in advance of travel though the [**Embassy of Japan in Ireland**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/).

Irish citizens with Status of Residence in Japan and who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are allowed to re-enter Japan subject to entry requirements.

### **Information on Entry Requirements**

In accordance with a partial amendment to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, from November 2007, all foreign visitors entering Japan will be fingerprinted and digitally photographed during entry procedures.

Those refusing to be fingerprinted or photographed will be denied entry to Japan. Persons under the age of 16, special status permanent residents and those performing actions which would be performed by those with a status of residence, "diplomat" or "official government business" will be exempt from these procedures.
