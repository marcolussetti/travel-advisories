## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime remains low in Japan but visitors should take sensible precautions.

### **Personal Safety**

Visitors should be aware that there have been numerous reported instances of drinks being spiked in certain districts in Tokyo, in particular in Roppongi and Kabuki-cho. Late at night, Western tourists in these areas may be approached on the street and brought to bars or clubs, served strong or spiked drinks, and then either robbed or asked under duress to pay large sums of money. We recommend visitors exercise vigilance late at night in these areas.

Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are rare, but do happen. Japanese law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual and committed through assault, intimidation or force.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Japan, report it to the local police immediately. Note that the police may initially refuse to issue a document which proves a report has been made. Please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Tokyo**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/japan/) if assistance is required.

### **Counselling Services**

Victims requiring professional counselling services are advised to contact [**TELL Japan**](http://telljp.com/) who offer free, anonymous telephone counselling and support across Japan.

### **Driving**

Like Ireland, driving in Japan is on the left hand side of the road. If planning to drive in Japan, the roads are well maintained and the rules of the road are broadly similar to Ireland.

If driving:

* Bring your international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* There are severe penalties against drink-driving or allowing someone else to drink and drive by, for example, being a passenger in a vehicle driven by a drunk driver.
* Longer-term residents who wish to drive in Japan will need to obtain a domestic driving licence within their first year in the country. The [**Tokyo Metropolitan Police website**](https://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/multilingual/english/traffic_safety/drivers_licenses/index.html) provides useful information about obtaining a Japanese licence.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Political tensions/Nuclear and missile tests by North Korea**

While the likelihood of an incident remains low, we encourage visitors to be prepared and to be familiar with established safety procedures.

Detailed information about what to do and how to prepare is available on the Japanese Governmentâ€™s [**Cabinet Secretariat Civil Protection Portal site**](http://www.kokuminhogo.go.jp/en/pdf/protecting.pdf). As in any emergency, the Embassy strongly advises you to follow the instructions of local authorities.
