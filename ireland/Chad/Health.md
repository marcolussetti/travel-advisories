Health services in Chad are limited and emergency services do not exist.

### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that visitors obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Visitors should check any exclusions and, in particular, that the policy covers the activities to be undertaken.

### **Water**

Avoid swimming or paddling in fresh water due to the risk of Bilharzia (Schistosomiasis).

Use bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth and avoid ice unless certain it was made from bottled water.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed at least eight weeks before travel. Please consult GP services, or International Health and Travel Centres, regarding vaccinations and malaria. Please note a Yellow Fever vaccination cert is a pre-entry requirement.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication to cover the entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Citizens may wish to also bring copies of prescriptions in case medications are lost.
