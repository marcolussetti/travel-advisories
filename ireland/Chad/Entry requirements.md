## Entry requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Chad. Please contact the closest Chadian Embassy (France or Belgium) for further information.

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry and have at least 1 blank page. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Chad and to carry a photocopy at all times while visiting.

### **Lost Passports**

Irish citizens who have lost their passport while in Chad should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Nigeria**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/). As there is no Irish Embassy in Chad we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document for travel home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

Citizens will need a police report to make a claim on travel insurance. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.
