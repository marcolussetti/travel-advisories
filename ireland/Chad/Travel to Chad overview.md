## Travel to Chad overview

### **Security Status**

Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

Due to the continuing risk of instability in Chad, in addition to the high risk of terrorist kidnapping and attacks, we advise against all travel to:

* The northern provinces of Chad, including Borkou, Ennedi Ouest, Ennedi Est, and Tibesti
* The west part of Kanem Province, including Nokou
* The Lake Chad region
* 30km of all of Chad’s borders

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against non-essential travel to the rest of Chad.

There remains a risk of public protests throughout Chad, which may occur in N’Djamena and other cities. Security forces often use live ammunition to disperse protests, leading to civilian fatalities and casualties.

A state of emergency remains in place for the Lake Chad region. There is an active insurgency ongoing in and around Lake Chad, including within Chadian borders.

Citizens in the country are advised to be vigilant, avoid unnecessary journeys, keep up to date with local developments, avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings, and observe any local curfews or restrictions. Citizens should also be prepared to leave the country, if possible, at short notice.
