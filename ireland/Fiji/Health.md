## Health

### **Health**

There are a high number of Leptospirosis cases nationwide. Stay away from flooded rivers or creeks, and wear footwear when outside. Monitor the [**Ministry of Health and Medical Services website**](http://www.health.gov.fj/) and [**Ministry of Health and Medical Services Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/MHMSFiji/) for information and updates.

Cases of Typhoid, Zika and Dengue are current throughout Fiji. Protect yourself against mosquito bites.

Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.

### **Meningococcal**

According to the World Health Organisation, meningococcal can be highly fatal. Get vaccinated before you travel. Symptoms include high fever, sensitivity to light or nausea. Seek urgent medical advice if symptoms persist.  More information is available on the [**Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningococcal-meningitis).

### **Medical Facilities**

Health care facilities in Fiji are adequate for routine medical treatment, but they are limited in range and may not be available in some regions. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation could be a likely option for treatment, and you should make sure that your insurance policy covers this. Be aware that doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.

### **Zika Virus**

Fiji is prone to dengue and Zika virus outbreaks. Infection with Zika virus has been increasingly linked with a serious birth condition called microcephaly where the baby is born with an abnormally small head and/or brain damage. An increase in cases of a neurological illness (called Guillan Barre Syndrome) have also been reported in areas where Zika virus outbreaks have occurred. Irish Citizens are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and plan to travel to areas affected by the Zika Virus, you are advised to discuss your travel plans with your healthcare provider and to consider postponing your travel to affected areas.

### **Dengue Fever**

Outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses (including dengue fever and filariasis) are common, with more serious outbreaks occurring from time to time. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. When you arrive, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Other Illnesses**

Water-borne, food-borne and other infectious diseases (including typhoid, hepatitis, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, measles and mumps) are common, with more serious outbreaks occurring from time to time. Fijian authorities have reported cases of typhoid in Suva and throughout the country.

### **Water**

We recommend that you boil all drinking water or drink bottled water, and avoid ice cubes, raw and undercooked food.
