## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. Possession of any amount of marijuana carries a mandatory three-month prison sentence.

### **Alcohol**

You can be arrested for being drunk and disorderly. You can be fined and detained if you cause damage to property or assault police officers.

It’s illegal to be under the influence of alcohol while at an airport. Airline travellers who are intoxicated may be detained by police.

### **Local Culture**

You may be invited to take part in the local ceremony of drinking kava. Be aware that in rare cases, there are indications that this could have adverse effects on the liver.

### **Law Enforcement**

Topless bathing and nudity in public is forbidden.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality in Fiji is legal. Nonetheless, discretion, and awareness of local sensitivities, is advised particularly when visiting rural communities.
