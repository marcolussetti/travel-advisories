## Natural disasters and climate

### **Cyclones**

The tropical cyclone season in Fiji normally runs from November to April, but cyclones can occur throughout the year. During this period there is a greater risk of strong winds, heavy rains, flooding, landslides and road closures.

Weather updates are available from [**Fiji Meteorological Service**](http://www.met.gov.fj/index.php) and can also be found in local newspapers and on Radio Fiji GOLD on 100.4 FM. The [**National Disaster Management Office**](http://www.ndmo.gov.fj/index.php) has information on how to prepare. The direction and strength of tropical cyclones can change with little warning. The [**Fiji Meteorological Service**](http://www.met.gov.fj/) provides up to date information about the weather conditions in Fiji and you can also get information from the [**World Meteorological Organisation Severe Weather Information Centre**](http://severe.worldweather.org/) **and** [**Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System**](http://www.gdacs.org/).

In the event of an approaching cyclone, you should identify your local shelter. Follow the instructions of local authorities and monitor the media for the latest developments. Carry your travel documents (ie passport, photo identification) or secure them in a safe, waterproof location. If possible, contact friends and family in Ireland with updates to let them know you’re safe.

Flights in and out of affected areas could be delayed or suspended and you should be aware that available flights may fill quickly. In some areas, adequate shelter from a severe cyclone may not be available to everyone who chooses to stay.

### **Earthquakes**

Fiji is in an earthquake zone and suffers from tremors from time to time. These can trigger tsunami alerts. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake, and take note of earthquake and tsunami-related instructions from your hotel or the local authorities.

### **Flooding**

Flash floods resulting in landslides and road blockages can happen throughout the year in the Fiji Islands. In periods of heavy rain, check with your tour operator or resort before travelling, particularly by road.
