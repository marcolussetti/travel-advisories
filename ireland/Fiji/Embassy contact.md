## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Fiji, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Australia.

If you require emergency assistance from the Embassy, please contact us on +61 2 62140000.

If you call outside normal working hours, you will be given instructions to call another number to speak to a Duty Officer.

Monday to Friday 9:30am – 12:30pm and 2pm – 4pm
