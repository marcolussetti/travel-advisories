## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Most Irish visitors to Fiji stay in resorts and these are generally very safe, however, petty crime, such as theft from hotel rooms is common.

If you intend to move outside resort areas, be aware of your surroundings and take additional precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Lock your luggage as a sensible precaution against luggage tampering, including theft.
* Significant numbers of foreign tourists are victims of violent robbery, particularly after dark in Suva and other towns. When you’re travelling, especially alone, take extra care, particularly if you’re visiting isolated locations.

Credit card fraud and ATM card skimming occur. Protect your PIN and be alert when using ATMs.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

Given that the nearest Irish Embassy is a huge distance away in Canberra, Australia, dealing with a lost or stolen passport can be extremely inconvenient and can take time to resolve. In emergencies, you can get limited consular assistance from EU partners with Embassies in Suva.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Fiji, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Canberra**](/en/australia/canberra/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Fiji, you should be extremely careful. Traffic discipline can be poor, roads are often badly lit and of poor quality and animals on the road are a hazard.  In particular, it’s dangerous to drive at night between Nadi and Suva. Severe weather can lead to roads becoming damaged, blocked or washed away. Seek local advice before you set out. If you want to drive, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Taxis/Minibuses**

When using taxis or mini buses, we advise you to use ones with yellow registration plates. This show that the vehicle recently complied with Land Transport Authority (LTA) regulations. Not all minibuses currently operating in Fiji are licensed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and unlicensed minibuses will probably not be insured.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Outdoor Activities**

Safety standards of tour operators in Fiji may not compare to Irish standards, especially for adventure sports (including diving) or on boats in coastal waters and between islands. There may not be enough life jackets for boats, rafts and kayaks. Check the operator’s credentials and safety equipment beforehand and make sure your travel insurance policy covers your planned activities.

### **Water Sports**

Be aware that there are dangerous riptides along many of Fiji’s reefs and river estuaries, so you should know what you’re dealing with before you get in the water. Always wear the appropriate safety equipment before going out to the reefs or engaging in water sports and take local advice on safety.

### **Money**

Before you go, organise a variety of ways to access your money overseas, such as credit cards, travellers' cheques, cash, debit cards or cash cards. Consult with your bank to find the most appropriate currency to carry and whether your ATM card will work.

### **Mobile Phone Coverage**

The mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns but coverage in some rural areas and outlying islands can be limited or non-existent. This may result in you being out of contact with home for periods of time.
