## Safety and security

### **Swimming**

Beach swimming in Seychelles can be dangerous at some times of the year. In general, the west coast is unsafe during the north-west monsoon (around December to March), and the east coast is unsafe during the south-east winds season (around May to September). Beaches at the southern tip of Seychelles are not suitable for swimming at any time.
