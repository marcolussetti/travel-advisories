## Entry Requirements

### Visas

The Seychelles is a visa-free country and passports should be valid for the duration of the intended visit. More information can be found [**here**](http://www.ics.gov.sc/visa-and-travel/visiting-seychelles).

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to the Seychelles and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you are abroad contact the Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is required if claiming on your travel insurance. A travel document cannot be issued without a police report.
