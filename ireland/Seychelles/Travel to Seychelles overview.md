## Travel to Seychelles overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

Seychelles are currently experiencing an outbreak of Chikungunya virus, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes. While not normally life-threatening, pregnant women infected around time of delivery can pass the virus to their baby, with risk of severe illness. Visitors can protect themselves by avoiding mosquito bites and should seek medical care if they develop fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain or rash, during or after travel.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Seychelles. All visitors are required to complete a digital Travel authorisation immigration form in advance of travel.

A valid passport is required for travel to Seychelles. Passports should be valid for the duration of the intended visit. No additional period of validity beyond this required. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Seychelles are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Tanzania on X [**@IrlEmbTanzania**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbTanzania) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Seychelles by dialling 999.
