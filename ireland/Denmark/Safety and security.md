## Safety and security

### **Political Stability/Unrest**

The political situation in Denmark is reasonably stable but there can be occasional outbreaks of social unrest, including, for example isolated incidents of civil disturbance or violence, particularly in the area of Christiania, in Copenhagen.

Always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can sometimes turn confrontational.

### **Terrorism**

Denmark’s terror threat level is currently categorised as ‘significant’, in addition to the ongoing global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Denmark but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Pickpockets are attracted to crowded, public areas frequented by tourists, especially during the summer, so be extra careful to keep your personal belongings such as passports, money and credit cards secure.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you are a victim of a crime while in Denmark, report it to the local police immediately. You can also contact us at the Embassy of Ireland in Copenhagen if you need help.

### **Driving**

If visitors are planning to drive in Denmark, you should take the same precautions as when in Ireland:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Be aware of Denmark’s traffic laws; dimmed headlights are mandatory at all times, parking violations carry heavy fines, and urban speed limits tend to be lower than in Ireland.
* Road conditions in winter can be icy. Main roads are normally well salted in central Copenhagen but may not be salted outside of the metropolitan area.

### **Vehicle Hire**

* If visitors are hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.
* Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged)

### **Cyclists**

Cycling is a feature in Danish life, and cyclists are very commonplace on Danish roads. Drivers need to be extremely careful, especially when turning right, as cyclists always have the right of way. It is vital to check your blind spot for a cyclist before turning.

Pedestrians should exercise caution when walking in the city and be aware of cyclists. Never walk on bike paths. If you are using public transport as a pedestrian, take care when getting on and off buses, as designated bike paths are usually located between the road and the footpath.

If hiring a bike, make sure it has working front and rear lights, reflectors on tyres and a bell otherwise you risk paying a hefty fine.

Make sure you familiarise yourself with the [**cycling rules**](https://international.kk.dk/live/transport-and-parking/cycling-in-copenhagen) before getting on a bike in Denmark.
