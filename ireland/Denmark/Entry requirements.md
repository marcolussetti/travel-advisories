## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Denmark. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you are advised to register your presence with the [**Danish immigration authorities**](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB).

### **Passport**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Denmark.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.
