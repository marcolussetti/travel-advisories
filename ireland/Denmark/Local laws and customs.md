## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and itâ€™s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Personal identification**

Visitors should carry personal identification at all times, for example either a passport or driving licence.
