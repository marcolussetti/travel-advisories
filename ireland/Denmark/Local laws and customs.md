## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it’s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors should carry personal identification at all times, for example either a passport or driving licence.

### **Currency**

The currency of Denmark is the Danish krone. Cash is used for payment less frequently than in Ireland, although ATMs are easy to find. Credit and debit cards are commonly used for payments, although foreign cards can attract a surcharge.
