## Entry requirements

### Visa

Irish citizens require a visa to enter the Republic of Congo.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to the Republic of the Congo and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in the Republic of the Congo there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

Contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise you on the fees which apply.
