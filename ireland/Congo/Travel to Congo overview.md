## Travel to Congo overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Irish citizens are advised to exercise a high degree of caution in respect of their personal safety while in the Republic of Congo (also known as Congo-Brazzaville). Irish citizens are also advised to follow developments in the region in respect of m-pox and to consult advice available such as on the [**HSE website**](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mpox/).

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against all travel to the area within 50km of the border with Central African Republic.

Citizens in the country are advised to be vigilant, keep up to date with local developments, and avoid any demonstrations and large gatherings. Irish citizens in Congo-Brazzaville or intending to travel to the country should ensure that they have [**registered**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

**Citizens in need of consular assistance should contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.**

### **COVID-19 Entry Requirements**

While there are currently no specific entry requirements related to COVID-19, travellers between regions of the Republic of Congo may be required to present a negative COVID-19 test result that is dated within three days before the date of travel within the country.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter the Republic of Congo.

A valid passport is required for travel to the Republic of Congo. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months after the confirmed date of departure from Congo. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Republic of Congo are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local and international news and social media.

As there is a risk of yellow fever and polio, among others, citizens are advised to check what vaccinations they may need for their trip to the Republic of Congo at least eight weeks before travel. They can get information about vaccinations from their local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The resources of emergency services in the Republic of Congo are limited and the response times can be protracted. The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, talk initially to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.
