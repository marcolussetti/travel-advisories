## Safety and security

Crime levels in Guyana are high, including frequent armed robberies, carjackings and other violent crimes. Do not walk in Georgetown during the day or night, especially if alone. Always drive with locked doors and closed windows. Avoid displaying any obvious signs of wealth (jewellery etc.) and keep your valuables locked in a hotel safe if possible. Always ensure that you travel with a licenced taxi company – do not hail taxis off the street. Exercise extra caution around banks and currency exchange bureaus.

The neighbourhoods of Agricola, Buxon, Tiger Bay, Albouystown, and Stabroek Market have been sites of violent attacks and should be avoided.

The ongoing border dispute on the western border between Guyana and Venezuela may result in increased tensions or security situation. If planning to travel to border areas, check with local authorities in advance.

If you are a victim of crime in Guyana report it to the local police at (+592) 225-2700, 226-4585 or (+592) 227-6123 and contact the Embassy in Brasília.
