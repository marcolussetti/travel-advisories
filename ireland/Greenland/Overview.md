### **General Travel Advice**

Greenland is not in the EU or party to the Schengen Agreement.

Irish citizens need a valid passport to enter Greenland. We recommend your passport be valid for three months past your intended departure date.

Irish citizens are permitted to travel to Greenland without a visa.

Visitors to Greenland are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Practical information on visiting Greenland is available here: [**Visit Greenland**](https://visitgreenland.com/).

Citizens can also follow the Embassy of Ireland in Denmark on social media (Twitter [**@IrishEmbDenmark**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbDenmark) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyDenmark/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

Greenland is the world’s largest island, and the vast majority of the country is unpopulated. The weather in Greenland is extreme.

Citizens travelling in Greenland, should make themselves aware of the risks and follow the advice of local authorities at all times. If travelling outside of populated areas of Greenland, please be aware that search and rescue response is extremely limited and likely to be coming from many hundreds of kilometres away, so could take days to arrive.

In the event of an emergency, the [**Greenland Police**](https://politi.gl/da) can be contacted by calling 701448.

As there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Greenland, and given the distances involved, the assistance we can provide in an emergency situation is limited. However, if there is an emergency, or citizens need help or advice, please contact our Embassy in Copenhagen on +45 3547 3200 or our Consular Assistance Unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.
