## Safety and security

The political situation in Greenland is stable, and in general there are no significant security concerns. The crime rate is low, but isolated incidents of violence or gun crime can happen.

Visitors are advised to stay informed of whatâ€™s going on by monitoring local media and staying in contact with their hotel or tour operator.

Irish citizens are advised to use reputable tour operators when travelling in Greenland. Do not use unlicensed operators, for example offering boat tours, as this will put you at serious risk if anything goes wrong. The capacity for search and rescue is extremely limited and visitors may be billed for the cost of any rescue.
