## Health

Visitors who become ill while travelling in Greenland, can be treated in the local health system. However, outside of the major cities, healthcare will be more limited, and in the event of serious illness or injury, it is likely that evacuation to Iceland or Denmark for treatment is required.

Visitors should ensure to travel with sufficient supplies of any required medications as it may not be possible to purchase these locally. Visitors should be aware that, due to changing weather conditions, flights can be cancelled and it may necessary to remain in Greenland longer than planned.

As Greenland is not part of the EU, the European Health Insurance Card does not provide coverage there.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Department cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. Citizens are advised to purchase an appropriate travel insurance policy, where these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save visitors a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that they get required medical attention when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of Euro, and a medical evacuation can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Irish citizens are advised that to make sure their policy covers all the activities planned for their trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if you’re making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you’re sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Visitors should be aware that most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
