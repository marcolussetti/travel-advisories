## Health

Visitors who become ill while travelling in Greenland, can be treated in the local health system. However, outside of the major cities, healthcare will be more limited, and in the event of serious illness or injury, it is likely that evacuation to Iceland or Denmark for treatment is required.

Visitors should ensure to travel with sufficient supplies of any required medications as it may not be possible to purchase these locally. Visitors should be aware that, due to changing weather conditions, flights can be cancelled and it may necessary to remain in Greenland longer than planned.

As Greenland is not part of the EU, the European Health Insurance Card does not provide coverage there.
