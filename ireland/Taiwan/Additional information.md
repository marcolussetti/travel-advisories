### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations you need for Taiwan.

### **Travel Insurance**

The Department of Foreign Affairs cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. These costs may be covered if appropriate travel insurance is purchased, however we are unable to mediate in the event of any disputes with insurance companies which may arise.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that the required medical attention is provided . Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Make sure to save the insurance provider’s contact information before departure, including any emergency assistance details, and have this information to hand should you need it while abroad.

### **Military Service**

Taiwan law provides for compulsory military service. If born in Taiwan or have ever held a Taiwan passport check the rules for military service in Taiwan before travelling.
