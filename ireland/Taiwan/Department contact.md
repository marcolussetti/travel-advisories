## Department contact

As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have a presence in Taiwan, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency situation.

Please contact our Consular Assistance Unit if you need guidance on the nearest assistance and we will help you as best we can.

Our number is: +353 1408 2527.

24 hours a day, 7 days a week
