## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Taiwan are generally low and the greatest risk to short-term visitors is petty crime such as pick-pocketing.

Always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Avoid carrying valuables or large sums of cash in public.
* Take particular care when in large crowds or when out at night, especially in the beach area, or at bars or nightclubs
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet caf√©s, train and bus stations.
* Make sure that your accommodation and vehicle are well secured, with locked doors and windows at all times.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Taiwan, report it to the local police immediately.
