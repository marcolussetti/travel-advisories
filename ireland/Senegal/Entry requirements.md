## Entry requirements

### Visa

Irish citizens do not need a visa to travel to Senegal. If intending to stay in Senegal for longer than 3 months, you must register with the local authorities in order to obtain a ‘Carte d’étranger’. This should be done following your arrival in Senegal.

Irish citizens can enter Senegal without a visa for up to 90 days but must provide:

* evidence of onward/return ticket,
* proof of sufficient funds,
* documentation showing purpose of trip and next destination,
* documentation required for next destination.

All passengers should also confirm with airline that boarding may be permitted without a visa.

### Passport

Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Senegal and have at least one blank page.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad contact the [**Irish Embassy in**](/en/senegal/dakar/) **Dakar**. We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is required if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. A travel document cannot be provided without a police report.
