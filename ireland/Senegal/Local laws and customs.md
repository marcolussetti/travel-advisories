## Local laws and customs

Senegal is a predominantly Muslim society, and you should respect local traditions, customs, and laws.

Bars and restaurants usually serve alcoholic drinks but drunkenness can be considered offensive.

Kissing as a greeting is acceptable, but kissing romantically in public is not.

Dress and behave modestly in public, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you visit religious areas. In Dakar and other popular tourist areas, western-style holiday clothing is generally accepted.

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Ramadan**

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink, or smoke during daylight hours. You should be aware that during Ramadan fasting can cause tiredness, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, and roads are significantly busier and subsequently more dangerous approaching sunset.

### **LGBTIQ+**

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Senegal, and is punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. Laws criminalising same-sex sexual activity are actively enforced.

Same-sex relationships and public displays of affection are not tolerated, and same-sex marriages are not recognised. LGBTQI+ rights activism is also not tolerated. Travellers are advised to exercise caution and discretion.
