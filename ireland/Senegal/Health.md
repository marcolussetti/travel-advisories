### **Travel Insurance**

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities planned during your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you are sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor what vaccinations may be required for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. You can find out more information about vaccinations on the [**HSE’s website**](http://www.hse.ie/portal/eng/health/az/V/Vaccinations,-travel/).
