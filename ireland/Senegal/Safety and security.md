## Safety and security

### **Pickpockets**

Senegal is a popular destination with tourists and most visits there are trouble-free. However, be careful of pickpockets in Dakar, especially at the airport, and in the areas around Place de lâ€™Independance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche.

### **Scams**

We advise travellers to be vigilant about potential scams, particularly business transactions offered over the internet which seem too good to be true or a slow-blossoming internet romance with sudden requests for financial assistance.

### **Casasmance Region**

The Casasmance region in the south west continues to experience incidents involving armed groups, separatists and clashes between the military and the MFDC (Movement of the Democratic Forces of Casamance). Avoid all road travel in the Casamance region to the west of Kolda, other than daytime travel on the main Ziguinchor to Cap Skiring road or the Sao Domingos to Ziguinchor road. Always monitor the local security situation and local media for security developments. Land mines remain problematic in this area so ensure to stick to paved roads and to take local advice.
