## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Senegal is a popular destination with tourists and most visits there are trouble-free. However, cases of robbery, burglary and assault do occur, including at tourist sites and hotels frequented by foreign nationals.

Travellers are advised to be vigilant about street crime like pickpocketing and bag-snatching, in particular in Dakar, especially at the airport, the central area of the Plateau, and the Western Corniche. To reduce your personal risk:

* avoid carrying large sums of money or valuables
* use a hotel safe to store passport and valuables whenever possible
* be alert when withdrawing cash from ATMs
* stay vigilant in crowded areas
* use crossbody bags worn in front, and secure valuables in front pockets or hidden money belts
* be particularly careful after nightfall and avoid walking alone
* take care of your belongings when arriving at and leaving hotels
* keep a copy of your passport’s photo page and your visa or entry stamp in a separate place

### **Protests**

There are frequent demonstrations about political issues in Dakar and other cities. These demonstrations can turn violent. Protestors sometimes block major roads, including the road between Blaise Diagne International Airport and the city of Dakar.

Violent student protests occur regularly in Dakar, particularly at Université Cheikh Anta Diop. Police can respond to these protests using force.

Monitor local media and ask local contacts about possible upcoming protests. During large demonstrations, you should:

* continue to monitor local media for information
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* stay away from areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution

If you are in doubt about where protests are taking place, or the level of safety of an area, stay at home or in your hotel.

### **Scams**

We advise travellers to be vigilant about potential scams, particularly business transactions offered over the internet which seem too good to be true or a slow-blossoming internet romance with sudden requests for financial assistance.

There is a risk of bogus taxi drivers pretending to know you and then overcharging you for the journey from the airport. Pre-arrange transport with your accommodation or an authorised operator.

Be cautious when changing cash, as there is a risk you will be scammed with fake money. Use ATMs or reputable exchange bureaux.

### **Transport and Road Safety**

You can drive in Senegal using a valid Irish license or an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 6 months.

If you are planning to drive in Senegal, you should be extremely careful. Road conditions and driving practices can be hazardous, including in Dakar and other main cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by poor driving, badly maintained vehicles, a lack of traffic signs, and inadequate lighting.

Drivers can make sudden and unpredictable movements without signalling and speeding is common. Many taxis and public mini-buses (‘cars rapides’) are not roadworthy by Irish standards, and are usually not insured. If using a hire car or vehicle, ensure the roadworthiness of the vehicle and the reliability of the driver before departure.

During the rainy season from June to September, torrential rains can cause floods and landslides which damage roads.

We strongly advise against undertaking long overland journeys, especially at night. Driving after dark is dangerous because of poorly lit roads and vehicles without lights. There is a risk of pedestrians and animals walking on poorly lit roads at night, including in Dakar.

Traffic congestion gets worse in the run-up to and during religious festivals.

If you have an accident, you must contact the police on 17 and wait for them to arrive at the scene. Do not move your car until a police officer gives you permission. In remote areas, go to the nearest police station to report the accident.

### **Casasmance Region**

The Casasmance region in the southwest continues to experience incidents involving armed groups, separatists and clashes between the military and the MFDC (Movement of the Democratic Forces of Casamance). Avoid all road travel in the Casamance region to the west of Kolda, other than daytime travel on the main Ziguinchor to Cap Skiring road or the Sao Domingos to Ziguinchor road. Always monitor the local security situation and local media for security developments. Land mines remain problematic in this area so ensure to stick to paved roads and to take local advice.

### **Terrorism**

The risk of a terrorist attack in Senegal is considered low, but cannot be ruled out.

Several terrorist groups operate in neighbouring Mali, including Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP). JNIM has increasingly conducted attacks in southern and western Mali near to the Senegalese border.

Irish citizens are advised to be vigilant, particularly when travelling in Eastern Senegal, and to avoid all travel within 25 kilometres of the Mali border and the Mauritania border in the Matam region. Travellers in Eastern Senegal should avoid all overland travel at night.
