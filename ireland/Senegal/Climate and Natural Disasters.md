## Climate and Natural Disasters

### **Flooding**

During the rainy season from June to September, torrential rain can cause flooding and landslides including on main roads in Dakar.

### **Harmattan**

From November to April, Senegal is affected by the Harmattan wind, a dry and dusty wind from the Sahara desert. The Harmattan can reduce visibility and cause respiratory issues. Travellers are advised to check the air quality during this period and adjust their plans accordingly – this may mean wearing face masks or avoiding outdoor activities.
