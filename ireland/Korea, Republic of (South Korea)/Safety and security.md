## Safety and security

### **Political situation**

There are currently heightened political tensions in South Korea following the impeachment and arrest of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Large demonstrations are likely to continue, including in the areas around Gwanghwamun Plaza (Jongno), the Constitutional Court (Anguk), Seoul Western District Court (Gongdeok) and the National Assembly (Yeouido). Follow the advice of local authorities and avoid large public gatherings.

Political and student demonstrations occur from time to time which can disrupt traffic, and sometimes there are violent clashes. Demonstrations tend to occur in city centre areas, particularly on Gwanghwamun at weekends. Monitor local media, follow the advice of local authorities and exercise caution.

Visitors should monitor the travel advice as the level of tension between North and South Korea can escalate at little notice. However, the likelihood of tensions directly impacting on the lives of those in the Republic of Korea is extremely slim. An armistice continues in effect between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The border between North and South Korea, the Demilitarised Zone or DMZ, is one of the most heavily-fortified borders in the world. The situation at this stage does not merit any cautionary advice about travelling to South Korea, although travel in the waters near the Northern Limit Line is not advisable. Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

South Korea has not been a target for terrorism in recent years, although North Korea has been accused of terrorist acts in the past.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in South Korea but visitors should take sensible precautions.

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Leave a photocopy of passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public, do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone and check you are not being followed.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to hotel or apartment entrance as possible

### **Reporting a crime**

If a victim of a crime while in South Korea, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at the [**Irish Embassy**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/republic-of-korea/seoul/) or [**Consulate/Honorary Consul**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/republic-of-korea/seoul/) if help is needed. Call 112 for police (an interpretation service is available during working hours).

### **Driving**

The rules of the road in South Korea are broadly similar to those in Ireland. However, unlike Ireland, driving is on the right side of the road. Excellent motorways link all major cities, but minor roads are often badly maintained. Road signs are usually written in both Korean and English.

If driving:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is against the law and it may result in being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Be aware of South Koreaâ€™s traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Wear seatbelts at all times
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **National exercises**

The South Korean authorities normally hold nationwide civil emergency exercises on the 15th day of the month, eight times a year (not January, February, July or December). Sirens are sounded, transport stopped and some people are asked to take shelter in metro stations or basements. Check local announcements for further information on exercises.
