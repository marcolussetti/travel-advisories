## Moving to South Korea

If moving to South Korea or have recently moved to South Korea, please refer to following information and useful links which might help when adapting to the new surroundings.

### **Teaching English in South Korea**

The majority of Irish nationals working in Korea are teaching English in private language institutes, public schools or universities. [**For further advice regarding teaching English in Korea, see here**](/en/republic-of-korea/seoul/).

### **1345 Immigration Contact Centre**

Irish nationals seeking information about where/how to apply for or renew Korean working visas should contact the nearest Korean Embassy where they are currently residing, if they do not live in Korea. In the event they are already residing in Korea, they should contact a branch office of the [**Korean Immigration Service**](http://www.immigration.go.kr/HP/IMM80/index.do) in their region, or contact the [**1345 Immigration Contact Centre**](http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_en.pt?categoryId=25&parentId=1113&catSeq=&showMenuId=746). Multilingual visa & immigration information services to expatriates in Korea are provided by the [**Korean e-Government for Foreigners**](http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/main_en.pt).

### **Social Security Agreement between Ireland and Korea**

On Thursday 1 January, 2009 an agreement between Ireland and the Republic of Korea came into effect. Its purpose is to enable persons who have paid social insurance in both countries, but have too few contributions in one country for a pension, to receive a pension on the basis of their combined periods of social insurance contributions.

It also allows a person to retain cover under their home country's legislation if they are sent to work temporarily for the same employer or a subsidiary company in the other country for a period of up to 5 years.

Please see the [**information leaflet**](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw125.aspx) for additional information. The relevant agency in Republic of Korea is the [**National Pension Service**](http://english.nps.or.kr/jsppage/english/main.jsp) and in Ireland it is the [**Department of Social Protection**](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx).

### **Double Taxation Agreement between Ireland and RoK**

Ireland and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) signed, in Dublin, on 18 July, 1990 a Convention for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains.

The Convention or Double Taxation Agreement provides for the allocation of taxing rights between the two countries and for the granting of relief from double taxation with regard to items of income and capital gains which, under the laws of both countries, may be taxed in both.

Citizens who have detailed questions on the issue should seek expert professional advice.
