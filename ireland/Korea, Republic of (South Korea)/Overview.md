### **General Travel Advice**

South Korea introduced an electronic travel authorisation system called K-ETA in 2021. Under this system, anyone who is eligible for visa free entry to South Korea is usually\* required to obtain K-ETA approval before departure. If you need to apply for a K-ETA, please apply through the [**official K-ETA website**](https://www.k-eta.go.kr/portal/apply/index.do). It can take up to 72 hours for K-ETA application to be processed.

\*Irish nationals who are travelling for short-term visit / business to South Korea are temporarily exempt from K-ETA. The temporary exemption ends on 31 December 2025.

A valid passport is required for travel to South Korea. Irish passports must be valid for the duration of your time in South Korea. Passport cards cannot be used.

**For more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.**

Visitors to South Korea are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The likelihood of tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalating to impact the lives of those in the Republic of Korea is very low. However, missile tests carried out by North Korea are a cause for concern and visitors should continue to monitor our Travel Advice in case of an increase in tensions. Citizens should also make sure to monitor advice from the Korean authorities and local media reports for updates.

Citizens can follow the Embassy on social media via X [**@IrishEmbKorea**](https://www.twitter.com/IrishEmbKorea), Instagram [**@irishembkorea**](https://www.instagram.com/irishembkorea), and Facebook [**@embassyofirelandkorea**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandkorea/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

It is strongly encouraged for all Irish citizens travelling to or resident in South Korea to register on our [**Citizens Registration Portal**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) so as to ensure that they can receive relevant communications being issued by the Embassy in the event of a crisis or emergency.

Currently, there is no requirement to take a COVID-19 test either before or after entry to Korea. However, the Korean authorities recommend that arrivals from certain jurisdictions use a ‘[**Q-Code system**](https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/guide.do)’ to register their travel plans and health status to help make the arrival process smoother. It is also possible to complete a paper health declaration upon arrival. Further information is [**available here**](https://overseas.mofa.go.kr/ie-en/brd/m_23775/view.do?seq=5&page=1).
