## Health

### Vaccinations

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for South Korea.

### **Visiting a Hospital**

There are international clinics at the major hospitals and specialist medical and dental clinics where English is spoken. If required to stay overnight, be aware that a friend or relative is expected to stay with the patient and attend to his/her non-medical needs (which do not fall to the nursing staff).

A doctor’s strike is ongoing in South Korea since February 2024, which has caused delays and postponements to surgeries and medical appointments, including at international clinics.

Please find a list of [**emergency medical facilities**](http://eng.safekorea.go.kr/facility/selectFacilityInfoList.do?fcltsSe=F02) throughout Korea, and a list of [**hospitals**](https://global.seoul.go.kr/web/news/senw/bordContDetail.do?brd_no=5&lang=en&mode=W&post_no=12520763DD86019EE063C0A8A023A077) in the Seoul Metropolitan area.

If visitors have an emergency and require an ambulance, please dial 119.

### **Medication**

Certain prescription drugs are considered controlled substances in South Korea. Some medications, including cannabis, CBD oil, hemp-derivate and amphetamines are strictly regulated and should not be brought to South Korea. Even with the doctor’s prescription, possession of these drugs could result in arrest / deportation.

For some prescription drugs (e.g. methylphenidate (used for ADHD in Ireland)) visitors must submit a [**written application to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety**](https://www.mfds.go.kr/brd/m_74/view.do?seq=43906&srchFr=&srchTo=&srchWord=%EB%A7%88%EC%95%BD&srchTp=0&itm_seq_1=0&itm_seq_2=0&multi_itm_seq=0&company_cd=&company_nm=&Data_stts_gubun=C9999&page=1) (MFDS) at least 10 working days in advance of travelling. If you have any questions about bringing medication to South Korea, please contact the MFDS directly at +82-43-719-2813 or by email at **narcotics@korea.kr**.

In addition, travellers should ensure they bring the original prescription and a letter from your doctor specifying your medical condition and the medicines you are importing.

The Korean Customs Service have the authority over which medications will be permitted entry to South Korea. For information on customs clearance for passengers, please see [**here**](https://www.customs.go.kr/english/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=8069&cntntsId=2743).

### **Cosmetic procedures**

South Korea is becoming an increasingly popular destination for cosmetic procedures. Irish citizens should seek to inform themselves of both the risks and benefits of any planned procedure, and are advised to discuss their plans carefully with their own doctor, dentist and/or hospital specialist before committing to any procedure abroad.
