**UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Madrid, or nearest Consulate, for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

### **General Travel Advice**

South Korea introduced an electronic travel authorisation system called K-ETA in 2021. Under this system, anyone who is eligible for visa free entry to South Korea is usually\* required to obtain K-ETA approval before departure. If you need to apply for a K-ETA, please apply through the [**official K-ETA website**](https://www.k-eta.go.kr/portal/apply/index.do). It can take up to 72 hours for K-ETA application to be processed.

\*Irish nationals who are travelling for short-term visit / business to South Korea are temporarily exempt from K-ETA. The temporary exemption ends on 31 December 2026.

A valid passport is required for travel to South Korea. Irish passports must be valid for the duration of your time in South Korea. Passport cards cannot be used.

**For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.**

Visitors to South Korea are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The likelihood of tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalating to impact the lives of those in the Republic of Korea is very low. However, missile tests carried out by North Korea are a cause for concern and visitors should continue to monitor our Travel Advice in case of an increase in tensions. Citizens should also make sure to monitor advice from the Korean authorities and local media reports for updates.

Citizens can follow the Embassy on social media via X [**@IrishEmbKorea**](https://www.twitter.com/IrishEmbKorea), Instagram [**@irishembkorea**](https://www.instagram.com/irishembkorea), and Facebook [**@embassyofirelandkorea**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandkorea/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
