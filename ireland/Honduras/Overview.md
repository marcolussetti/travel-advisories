High Degree of Caution

### Travel Alert

The wet season in Honduras runs from June to November, during which heavy rainfall can result in flooding, landslides, and damage to infrastructure, particularly in rural or mountainous areas. Irish citizens in the country should exercise caution and monitor updates from local agencies and follow official advice, namely Honduras’ [**Secretariat of Risk and Contingency Management**](http://mailgun.internationalsos.com/c/eJxUzcGO6iAUgOGngR3mQE9Lu2BBUa4m18SkM7Nn4FSbjMW06MR5-sks3f7Jn-_fcTjSuoYzHbZGNVBXqKqOD1OhmBc6FLoetobpvt5p31jvRed8J9CCE1a7VmgAsL6XiNYxvX05_4f5fA9nMjS_9A9a1inPRvLhuf4JySBPBknGkZORWrZNLUFJfjEA4TMQNpBiSFWIENs0qojNqEdJQfLJ9BIbbGolXIsosK9q0beVFH1vHUCnbetqhvA-7OSwt6fh-HYaoOJf5lLKbWWVZcoz5cv3VAotm5ivTHmXbxTzPs_pvoRV8sVcAz1o88jzhZ7zVH4YQhrDZiL-MOo3AAD__1BkYqs) and Permanent Contingency Commission ([**COPECO**](http://mailgun.internationalsos.com/c/eJxUzU-L4yAYgPFPozeDr3mN5uBBbd0tbKHg7t7T-OYPTJPSZAqdTz_MsdcHHn6_zvlM29aNdDo41Uhdo6pbnued-vVBp51up4NjJuijSY1PSbQxtQK9jMKbaIWRUvoUANFHZg5v559uGT-7kRwtb_0_PbZ5XRzw_Np-hOKQF4cE_cDJgQHbaJAK-ORKsfoKpim9BSBoB-pASW3VUEi1WPPZBcAGG61EtIgCQ61FsDWIEHyUsjXeRs1Q_stHyL_9JZ__XrKs-Yeb9v2-sdozlZhK_Xqnfq3G9VpNC1OJP9ytoydVz3WZ6LXM-xdDWYaumok_nfoOAAD__8UnXD8)).

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Honduras. Visitors should note that Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.

Travellers should note that there have been reported incidents of Irish citizens being refused entry to Honduras at the El Amatillo land crossing between El Salvador and Honduras. Honduras introduced a visa requirement for UK tourists in 2024 and in limited cases, this has affected Irish citizens born in the United Kingdom attempting to enter the country on their Irish passport. Should you encounter any difficulties while attempting to enter Honduras, contact the Irish Embassy in Mexico.

A valid passport is required for travel to Honduras. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

All passengers are required to pre-register online with Honduran Immigration authorities [**here**](https://prechequeo.inm.gob.hn/Login) prior to arrival and departure, and bring a copy of the form with them when travelling. However, there have been reports of technical issues with the pre-registration. If, after trying alternative browsers, registration is not possible, please contact your nearest Honduran Embassy/Consulate, as well as your airline. Visitors can also call the migration authorities on +504 2232 7800 or email **sugerencias@inm.gob.hn.**

High levels of crime and violence are prevalent throughout Honduras, particularly in and around Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Visitors should therefore make sure to research their destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Honduras.

### **State of exception or emergency**

Local authorities periodically declare a state of emergency in various municipalities to fight against gang-related crime and extortion. One such measure was announced nationwide in December 2022 for 30 days, and continues to be applied in a range of municipalities.

Visitors to Honduras are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

While a state of emergency is in effect, security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures and detain persons of interest. If visitors are travelling in an area where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X @[**IrishEmbMexico**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbMexico/status/1585702058497232896/photo/3) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Honduras by dialling 911.
