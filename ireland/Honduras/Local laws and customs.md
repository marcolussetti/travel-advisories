## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors should carry personal identification at all times in Honduras.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

Homosexuality is not illegal in Honduras, but there is also no recognition of same-sex marriage in Honduras. Public displays of affection by same-sex couples may draw unwanted attention, particularly outside of the capital, and travellers should exercise caution in this regard.
