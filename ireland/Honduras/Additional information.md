Visitors should note that Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.
