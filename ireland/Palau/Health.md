### **Medical Facilities**

If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for assistance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Health facilities in Palau are adequate for routine medical care, but limited in availability and quality. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.

The only national hospital is ‘Belau National Hospital’, in the capital, Koror, which can generally be reached in less than two hours from most locations. The hospital has the only hyperbaric chamber in Palau, an operating suite, dialysis machines and an outpatient clinic. The hospital also houses a pharmacy that dispenses basic medicines.

There are small number of private clinics and community health centres that offer basic primary and urgent care services.

Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalisation or evacuation may be very expensive. Emergency treatment or treatment for serious conditions is limited and so you may be medically evacuated to another country. This can take time to arrange and costs can escalate quickly, so make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

### **Immunisation**

Cholera and Yellow Fever immunisations are required for those arriving from infected areas.
