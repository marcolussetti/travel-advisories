## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Most Irish visitors to Palau stay in resorts and these are generally very safe, however, petty crime may still occur.

If you intend to move outside resort areas, be aware of your surroundings and take additional precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Lock your luggage as a sensible precaution against luggage tampering, including theft.

### **Lost or stolen passports**

Given that the nearest Irish Embassy is a significant distance away in Manila, Philippines, dealing with a lost or stolen passport can be extremely inconvenient and can take time to resolve.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Palau, report it to the local police immediately. You can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Manila**](/en/philippines/manila/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

Take care when driving, particularly at night. Serious road traffic accidents happen frequently and emergency medical facilities are limited. Seek local advice before you set out. If you want to drive, bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
