## Entry requirements

### **Passport**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Luxembourg.

We advise carrying a copy or scan of your passport information page available during your stay in case required.

### Visa

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Luxembourg. EU citizens wishing to stay for more than 90 days must declare their arrival and register at their local commune of residence.
