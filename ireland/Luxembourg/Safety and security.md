## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Luxembourg is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Luxembourg but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* It is advisable to carry your passport or a clear photocopy at all times should you be requested to produce a form of identification by the Luxembourg police.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Luxembourg, report it to the local police immediately. The police in Luxembourg can be contacted by dialling 112.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Luxembourg, take the same precautions as in Ireland but remember cars drive on the right hand side of the road. If driving, bring your international driving license and ensure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
