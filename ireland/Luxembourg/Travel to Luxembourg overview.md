Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Luxembourg.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Visitors to Luxembourg are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X: [**@IrlinLuxembourg**](https://twitter.com/irlinluxembourg?lang=en) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyOfIrelandLuxembourg/): Embassy of Ireland in Luxembourg) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
