A valid passport is required for travel to Lesotho and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the intended date of departure from Lesotho. Passport cards cannot be used. Passports must have at least two blank pages and must not be damaged in any way. If your passport fails on either count, it will be not be accepted by the Lesotho authorities.
