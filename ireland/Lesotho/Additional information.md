## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to travel to Lesotho for up to a period of 44 days after which a residential permit must be applied for at the Ministry of Home Affairs in Maseru.

### **Passports**

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Lesotho and also must be valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of exit from Lesotho. You must have at least two spare pages to allow the immigration authorities to affix visa stamps.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Lesotho and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

A police report is needed if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide a new travel document without a police report.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home
* If required, provide advice and assistance in applying for new passport

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy in Lesotho there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new travel document.

### **Money**

Visitors should take traveller's cheques or South African Rand in cash, which circulates as an official currency in Lesotho along with the Maloti (local currency). Maloti are not generally accepted in South Africa.

### **ATMs**

Some of ATMs in Lesotho have the facility to accept international ATM cards (First National Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank). Credit cards are widely accepted (Visa/Master cards) in most stores and restaurants in Maseru. However, visitors may find places in the rural areas that do not accept these cards.

### **Climate**

Maseru and the surrounding lowlands often reach 30⁰C in summer.

Winters can be cold with lowlands getting down to -7⁰C and the highlands could be as low as -18⁰C at times. Snow is common in the highlands between May and September. Take note of weather forecasts before travelling in the highlands during these months.

Lesotho’s varied climate brings different forms of drought, floods, heavy snowfalls and any other forms of weather-related hazards. At the moment, about three-quarters of all the country’s natural disasters are related to weather, climate and water and their extremes.
