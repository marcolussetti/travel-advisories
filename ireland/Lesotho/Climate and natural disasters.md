## Climate and natural disasters

### **Climate**

Maseru and the surrounding lowlands often reach 30⁰C in summer.

Winters can be cold with lowlands getting down to -7⁰C and the highlands could be as low as -18⁰C at times. Snow is common in the highlands between May and September. Take note of weather forecasts before travelling in the highlands during these months.

Lesotho’s varied climate brings different forms of drought, floods, heavy snowfalls and any other forms of weather-related hazards. At the moment, about three-quarters of all the country’s natural disasters are related to weather, climate and water and their extremes.
