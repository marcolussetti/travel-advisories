## Safety and security

### **Political unrest**

There are occasionally spontaneous political demonstrations in Maseru and it is advisable to avoid demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings as a precaution. Monitor local media for reports of demonstrations or unrest.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Lesotho is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime rates in Lesotho have increased in recent years so please take sensible precautions when visiting:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
* Do not walk around Maseru after dark and avoid driving in rural areas at night.
* Keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight when driving in urban centres, especially Maseru.

### **Petty theft**

Muggers in central Maseru sometimes target foreign nationals. We advise to avoid walking alone in isolated areas or after dark and driving in rural areas at night. Only carry essentials with you and keep valuables out of sight.

### **Theft from vehicles**

When driving in urban centres, especially Maseru, keep doors locked, windows shut and valuables out of sight. Park in well-lit areas and do not pick up strangers. Take care at the approaches to main border crossings, particularly at night. Armed car hijacking is also increasing.

### **Personal safety**

There have been recent incidences of armed attacks on pedestrians. If visitors have no alternative but to walk around Maseru, avoid taking the same route repeatedly and be vigilant. If attacked, or your car is hijacked, do not resist.

### **Taxis**

There is a public transport/taxi service in Lesotho but safety cannot be guaranteed. We recommend visitors take telephone taxis. Always confirm the fare in advance and never take a lift from a stranger.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Lesotho, report it to the local police immediately. Citizens can contact us at our Irish Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Lesotho, you should be extremely careful as road safety standards are poor.

If visitors want to drive:

* Bring your international driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance – after three months, you must get a local driving licence
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Watch out for animals roaming on the roads, especially at night
* Local mini-bus taxis are often poorly maintained and uninsured, and ignore road safety rules

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
