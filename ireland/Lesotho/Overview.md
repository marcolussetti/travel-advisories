Irish citizens do not require a visa to travel to Lesotho for up to a period of 44 days, after which a residential permit must be applied for at the Ministry of Home Affairs in Maseru. Please consult your nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Lesotho before travelling for further information.

A valid passport is required for travel to Lesotho and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the intended date of departure from Lesotho. Passport cards cannot be used. Passports must have at least two blank pages and must not be damaged in any way. If your passport fails on either count, it will be not be accepted by the Lesotho authorities.

Visitors to Lesotho are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria on Twitter [**@IrlEmbPretoria**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbPretoria) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
