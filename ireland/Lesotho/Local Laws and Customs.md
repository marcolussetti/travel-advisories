## Local Laws and Customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Money**

Visitors should take traveller's cheques or South African Rand in cash, which circulates as an official currency in Lesotho along with the Maloti (local currency). Maloti are not generally accepted in South Africa.

### **ATMs**

Some of ATMs in Lesotho have the facility to accept international ATM cards (First National Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank). Credit cards are widely accepted (Visa/Master cards) in most stores and restaurants in Maseru. However, visitors may find places in the rural areas that do not accept these cards.
