## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to travel to Lesotho for up to a period of 44 days after which a residential permit must be applied for at the Ministry of Home Affairs in Maseru. Please consult your nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Lesotho before travelling for further information.

### **Passports**

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Lesotho and also must be valid for a minimum period of 90 days from the date of exit from Lesotho. You must have at least two spare pages to allow the immigration authorities to affix visa stamps.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Lesotho and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

A police report is needed if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide a new travel document without a police report.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home
* If required, provide advice and assistance in applying for new passport

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy in Lesotho there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new travel document.
