## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Togo, consular assistance is provided via the [Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/).

Irish citizens who require urgent assistance while the Embassy is closed can contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs on +353 1 408 2000. The Duty Officer will refer the matter to the Embassy.

Monday to Thursday 09:00-16:00; Friday 09:00-12:00
