Irish citizens must apply for an [**eVisa**](https://voyage.gouv.tg/) at least 6 days in advance and provide a printed copy of this application at passport control when visiting Togo.

Travellers are requested to have a travel itinerary for their proposed period of stay and have sufficient proof of funds to cover their stay in Togo.

### **Passport**

Passports must be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry into Togo and have at least two blank pages.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Togo and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abuja**](/en/nigeria/abuja/). We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give.

What we can do:

* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is required if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We cannot provide a travel document without a police report.
