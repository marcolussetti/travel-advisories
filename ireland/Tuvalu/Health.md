## Health

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. We advise you to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel with provision for medical evacuation.

Medical treatment is generally available only in or near Funafuti, where Tuvalu’s only hospital is located. The outer islands are served by trained nurses. Medical facilities are generally adequate for routine medical treatment. For more serious or complicated problems medical evacuation to Fiji, Australia or New Zealand may be required.

You should boil all drinking water or drink bottled water while in Tuvalu.

Dengue fever occurs in Tuvalu. Travellers are advised to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and stay in lodgings where there are mosquito screens on windows and doors.

Ciguatera, or fish poisoning, is an illness caused by eating fish containing certain toxins. It can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and tingling fingers or toes and can be found in many areas of the tropical Pacific region. There is no way to tell whether fish has been contaminated, so if you are visiting a Pacific island and want to avoid ciguatera, avoid eating reef fish.  Deep water fish like tuna are a better option.
