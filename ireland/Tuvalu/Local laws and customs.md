## Local laws and customs

### **Law and Crime**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Tuvaluan law criminalizes male homosexual relations. If you are convicted, you could face imprisonment, though enforcement of the law is rare.

### **Currency**

The Australian dollar is the currency used in Tuvalu. Be prepared to pay cash for hotel bills and all other services, as credit card services are not available. There are no ATMs on Tuvalu.

### **Road Conditions and Safety**

Traffic moves on the left in Tuvalu. The main roads on Funafuti are paved, but other roads on other islands are generally unpaved. Animals and pedestrians walking in the road make night driving on unlit secondary roads hazardous.
