## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Tuvaluan law criminalizes male homosexual relations. If you are convicted, you could face imprisonment, though enforcement of the law is rare.

Tuvalu prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disability. There are no mandated building accessibility provisions for persons with disabilities. The only multi-story government building has elevators, but they are not always operational. There are no elevators in private multi-story buildings.

### **Telephone Services**

There is one local mobile network in Tuvalu; other international networks will not work while in Tuvalu. Local SIM cards can be purchased in Funafuti.

The Australian dollar is the currency used in Tuvalu. Be prepared to pay cash for hotel bills and all other services, as credit card services are not available. There are no ATMs on Tuvalu.
