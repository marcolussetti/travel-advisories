## Safety and security

### **Petty crime**

Crime in Tuvalu is low but petty crime can occur.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Tuvalu:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Telephone services**

There is one local mobile network in Tuvalu; other international networks will not work while in Tuvalu. Local SIM cards can be purchased in Funafuti.

### **Swimming and ocean activities**

Take great care when swimming off the outer coasts of Tuvalu’s atolls as there are very strong rip currents along coast and reef areas. Swimming in Funafuti lagoon is not recommended as it is highly polluted.

Safety inspections for equipment, vehicles and facilities do not commonly occur in Tuvalu. For this reason, hazardous areas are not always identified and Maritime safety is concern. Visitors should reconsider boarding vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy. Also  wear safety equipment at all times during boating trips.

### **Weather**

Cyclone season within the South Pacific runs through from the start of November to the end of April. The cyclone season can have a number of severe storms, on average around nine tropical cyclones each season. The category of the storms can vary. During a cyclone do not go outdoors, and remain away from the sea and rivers.

You should monitor local and international weather updates from the [**World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)**](http://severe.worldweather.org/), or the [**Tuvalu Meteorological Service**](http://informet.net/tuvmet/).

Tuvalu prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disability. There are no mandated building accessibility provisions for persons with disabilities.
