## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

There is no visa requirement for travellers from any country who wish to travel to Suriname for tourism or family visits for a period of 90 days.

An entry fee of US$50 or â‚¬50 applies for each person entering Suriname for the purposes of tourism and family visits. This fee can be paid through the [**website**](https://surinameappuat.vfsevisa.com/suriname/online/home/index)**.** The entry fee must be paid in advance of travel and the entry fee voucher presented at immigration on arrival.

All travellers to Suriname must also complete a digital immigration and customs form. This can be filled out on the [ICF Suriname website](https://icf.sr/start-general/) from three days prior to travel.

Passports should be valid for 6 months from the date of arrival.

Passengers from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission may be requested to show proof of vaccination against yellow fever at the port of entry by presenting their original international yellow fever vaccination card.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. We advise you to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel. Be aware that medical facilities can be limited in Suriname, especially outside of Paramaribo.
