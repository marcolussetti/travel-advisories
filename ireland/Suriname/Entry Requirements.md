## Entry Requirements

### **Visa/Passport**

There is no visa requirement for Irish citizens who wish to travel to Suriname for tourism or family visits for a period of 90 days. A visa is required for business or other purposes, for which you must apply through the nearest Surinamese Embassy or Consulate.

An entry fee of US$50 or â‚¬50 applies for each person entering Suriname for the purposes of tourism and family visits. All travellers to Suriname must also complete a digital immigration and customs form. Both the fee and the form can be completed from 7 days prior to your arrival on the [**ICF Suriname website**](https://icf.sr/).

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Suriname.

Passengers from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission may be requested to show proof of vaccination against yellow fever at the port of entry by presenting their original international yellow fever vaccination card.
