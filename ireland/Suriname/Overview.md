### **General Travel Advice**

There is no visa requirement for travellers from any country who wish to travel to Suriname for tourism or family visits for a period of 90 days.

An entry fee of US$50 or €50 applies for each person entering Suriname for the purposes of tourism and family visits. This fee can be paid through the [**website**](https://surinameappuat.vfsevisa.com/suriname/online/home/index). The entry fee must be paid in advance of travel and the entry fee voucher presented at immigration on arrival.

All travellers to Suriname must also complete a digital immigration and customs form. This can be filled out on the [ICF Suriname website](https://icf.sr/start-general/) from three days prior to travel.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Suriname. More information can be found in the Additional Information tab.

### Emergency Assistance

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

You can contact the emergency services in Suriname by dialling 112, or the following numbers:

* Police: 115
* Fire brigade: 110
* Ambulance: 113
