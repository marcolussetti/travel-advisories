## Safety and security

There have been incidences of pickpocketing and robbery in Paramaribo. Pay attention to your surroundings, do not show any obvious signs of wealth, and do not walk alone at night.

Exercise particular caution in around local banks and secluded areas e.g. in the Palm Garden (Palemtuin).
