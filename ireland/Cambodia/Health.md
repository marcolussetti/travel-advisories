## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Cambodia are required.

### **Medical Facilities**

The standard of health care in Cambodia is sufficient for treating minor injuries in the major cities but if more complicated treatment is needed, visitors may need to be evacuated to another country. This may be expensive, so please have comprehensive travel insurance that will cover medical evacuation if required.

If emergency medical assistance is required, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance. Visitors should contact their insurance provider promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment. Be prepared to pay for treatment in advance, which is a requirement at some medical facilities in Cambodia.

### **Avian Influenza**

There have been outbreaks of avian influenza (bird flu) in Cambodia and a number of human infections and fatalities (believed to have arisen through close contact with infected poultry) have been reported.

The risk from avian influenza is believed to be low, as long as certain precautions are taken. Avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds and make sure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.

### **Dengue Fever**

Cases of dengue fever are showing a steady increase and it is common in both rural and urban areas of Cambodia (including Phnom Penh). Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, especially just after dawn and before dusk, by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

There is currently no medication or vaccination available for travellers to prevent dengue but if symptoms show seek medical advice immediately.

### **Other Diseases**

Malaria and Japanese encephalitis occur in rural areas of Cambodia and are transmitted by mosquitoes. Your doctor will advise as to appropriate prophylactic measures or vaccines, depending on the length of your stay and the areas you intend to visit. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication.
