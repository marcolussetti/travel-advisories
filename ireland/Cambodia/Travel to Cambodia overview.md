## Travel to Cambodia overview

### **Security Status**

Normal Precautions

### **Travel Alert**

**Thailand Border Region**

We advise against all travel to the entirety of the border region between Cambodia and Thailand, where armed clashes have been taking place between Cambodian and Thai armed forces arising from escalating tensions related to longstanding border disputes. The clashes have resulted in fatalities, including civilian fatalities. Border crossings are subject to restrictions and closures, and there may also be a possibility of disruption to air travel between the two countries. We strongly advise citizens against any attempt to approach or cross the border. The situation remains very fluid and Irish citizens in Cambodia or intending to visit the country should pay close attention to authoritative sources of information and advice, and remain vigilant at all times.

### **General Travel Advice**

Tourists wishing to travel to Cambodia can apply for an [**E-visa**](https://www.evisa.gov.kh/) or visa-on-arrival.

All passengers arriving into Phnom Penh or Siem Reap airports must also submit [**an e-Arrival Card (CeA)**](https://arrival.gov.kh/) within seven days of arrival date.

Fees, conditions and photograph requirements are subject to change. Please check the website of the [**Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation**](https://www.evisa.gov.kh/) for the latest information. All visitors to Cambodia must hold a passport that is valid for at least six months from the time of entry into Cambodia and contain at least one blank page for a visa stamp. Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Cambodia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Vietnam on social media (X [**irlembvietnam**](https://twitter.com/irlembvietnam) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassyinvietnam/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
