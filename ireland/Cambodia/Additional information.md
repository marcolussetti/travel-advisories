## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Passport**

All visitors to Cambodia must hold a passport that is valid for at least six months from the time of entry into Cambodia and contain at least one blank page for a visa stamp. Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing.

### **Visas**

Vistors can get a visa on arrival at the Cambodian border. They will need to bring two passport photographs. A tourist visa costs US $30 (with an additional $7 processing fee) for one month and can be extended for only one extra month. Payment for visas is accepted in US dollars only. For business visas, we recommend that you contact the nearest Cambodian Embassy before travelling.

### **e-Visas**

The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs operates an electronic visa (e-Visa) facility for tourist visas only. The e-Visa costs US $30 and can only be used at the main entry crossings with the immigration IT system. Tourists can [**apply for an e-Visa online**](https://www.evisa.gov.kh/) to the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where full terms and conditions are also listed, with information on which border entry points accept the e-Visa.

All passengers arriving into Phnom Penh or Siem Reap airports must also submit [an e-Arrival Card (CeA)](https://arrival.gov.kh/) within seven days of arrival date. This system replaces the paper-based arrival card previously in use. Passengers are advised to submit the required information through the [online website](https://arrival.gov.kh/) or via the new app, available on the Google Play Store and the Apple Store. This process is free of charge.

### **Validity**

Tourist visas issued by a Royal Cambodian Embassy abroad may appear to have a longer validity than one month. Their validity refers to time to enter Cambodia. The visa is valid for 30 days from the actual date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival, whether entering through an airport or land crossing.

Overstaying either business or tourist visas without the proper authority is a serious matter and you can be held in detention until a fine is paid ($10 per day for the first 30 days). Travellers have been imprisoned and deported at their own expense for overstaying. Please note that there is **no upper limit on the amount of the fine that can be imposed and travellers who have overstayed have often been required to pay upwards of $1000 USD upon departure**.

If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements to Cambodia, check with the The Royal Cambodian Embassy who can be contacted at [**camemb.eng@mfa.gov.kh**](mailto:camemb.eng@mfa.gov.kh)

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Cambodia are required.

### **Medical facilities**

The standard of health care in Cambodia is sufficient for treating minor injuries in the major cities but if more complicated treatment is needed, visitors may need to be evacuated to another country. This may be expensive, so please have comprehensive travel insurance that will cover medical evacuation if required.

If emergency medical assistance is required, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance. Visitors should contact their insurance provider promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment. Be prepared to pay for treatment in advance, which is a requirement at some medical facilities in Cambodia.

### **Avian influenza**

There have been outbreaks of avian influenza (bird flu) in Cambodia and a number of human infections and fatalities (believed to have arisen through close contact with infected poultry) have been reported.

The risk from avian influenza is believed to be low, as long as certain precautions are taken. Avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds and make sure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.

### **Dengue fever**

Cases of dengue fever are showing a steady increase and it is common in both rural and urban areas of Cambodia (including Phnom Penh). Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, especially just after dawn and before dusk, by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

There is currently no medication or vaccination available for travellers to prevent dengue but if symptoms show seek medical advice immediately.

### **Other diseases**

Malaria and Japanese encephalitis occur in rural areas of Cambodia and are transmitted by mosquitoes. Your doctor will advise as to appropriate prophylactic measures or vaccines, depending on the length of your stay and the areas you intend to visit. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication.

### **Money**

The local currency is the Cambodian Riel and US Dollars are widely accepted and used for most transactions. Vistors can also use Thai Baht in border areas with Thailand.

### **ATMs**

ATMs are not widely available outside the major cities and tourist areas and some ATMs may not accept international cards.

### **Credit cards**

Credit cards are accepted in some hotels and by some businesses in larger cities, but outside the main centres visitors may find that cash is the only acceptable currency.

### **Travellers’ cheques**

Visitors can cash travellers’ cheques in many banks and bureaux de change.
