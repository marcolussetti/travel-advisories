## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal. If visitors are convicted of a crime in Cambodia they can expect a long prison sentence. Pre-trial detention for suspects can also last many months.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Visitors should not engage in any illegal activity. Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. Illegal drugs procured in Cambodia are likely to have been tampered with or spiked.

### **Alcohol**

Visitors should be aware of spiked drinks, particularly late at night in bars. Do not leave food or drink unattended or accept food or drink from strangers.

Home-made alcohol may be contaminated with bacteria or with toxic chemicals from pesticides and should be avoided.

### **Law Enforcement**

Crimes such as sex offences or fraud can result in long prison terms. The Cambodian legal system is not very well developed and the standard of prisons is very poor.

### **Photography**

Photography of, or near, military installations is generally prohibited.

### **Getting Married**

The Cambodian Government has lifted its suspension on marriages between Cambodians and foreign nationals in Cambodia. If you want to marry in Cambodia, contact us in Dublin or the [**Irish Embassy in Hanoi**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/vietnam/hanoi/) for details of the new regulations.

### **Surrogacy**

The procurement of surrogacy services in Cambodia is illegal and punishable as an offence under the criminal code. Any Irish person seeking to source surrogacy services in Cambodia should be aware of this, and should additionally note that outside Phnom Penh, access to healthcare and medical services can be basic.

### **Money**

The local currency is the Cambodian Riel and US Dollars are widely accepted and used for most transactions. Vistors can also use Thai Baht in border areas with Thailand.

### **ATMs**

ATMs are not widely available outside the major cities and tourist areas and some ATMs may not accept international cards.

### **Credit Cards**

Credit cards are accepted in some hotels and by some businesses in larger cities, but outside the main centres visitors may find that cash is the only acceptable currency.

### **Travellers’ Cheques**

Visitors can cash travellers’ cheques in many banks and bureaux de change.
