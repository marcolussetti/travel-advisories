### **Flooding**

In recent years there have been recurring heavy rains between November and February across Saudi Arabia. This can lead to serious flooding that has resulted in a number of deaths and severe damage to property. Roads may be impassable due to flooding.

During this period you should regularly check local weather forecasts and local media reporting, and to take appropriate precautions.
