## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country in which Sharia Law is strictly enforced.  You should respect local traditions, customs, law and religion at all times.  You should dress conservatively, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals or if you are visiting religious areas.

During the month of Ramadan it is forbidden to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours.  This law is strictly enforced.

The public practice of any religion other than Islam is illegal and is considered as  attempting to convert others. Violations may result in imprisonment and/or deportation.

### **Travel bans and legal disputes**

The Saudi authorities may place a travel ban on individuals involved in ongoing commercial, financial or labour disputes, legal cases or investigations, or with outstanding debts (this list is not exhaustive). Private Saudi citizens may also initiate travel bans against foreign citizens for various reasons.

When placed under a travel ban, you cannot exit the country, even if you are an Irish citizen or a dual Irish-Saudi citizen. Such bans are rigidly enforced and can take years, to resolve. Only Saudi Arabian authorities and sponsors can remove travel bans. If you are prevented from leaving the country because of an exit ban, you should seek legal advice immediately. Please also contact the Irish Embassy for consular assistance, which is provided in line with the [**Consular Assistance Charter**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/consular-assistance-charter/).

### **Illegal drugs**

There are strong penalties for possession of or dealing in illegal drugs, including the application of the death penalty.

### **Forbidden products**

Importing and drinking alcohol, pork products and pornographic material is forbidden in Saudi Arabia. The penalties for possession of any of these items are severe.  Electronic devices such as phones, tablets and laptops may be checked by officials.

You should not arrive in Saudi Arabia under the influence of alcohol.

### **Local culture**

Men are expected to dress modestly in full-length trousers and shirts with sleeves, although the sleeves can be short.

### **Female Travellers**

Unaccompanied female travellers may experience unwanted attention or comments in public.

If you are travelling in Saudi Arabia, you should only travel in pre-booked taxis known to be safe and avoid hailing a taxi in the street or accepting a lift from someone you do not know.

### **Dress and Behaviour**

Local laws, customs and religions should be respected at all times. Visitors should be aware of laws and etiquette, see [**here**](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/laws-and-etiquette.html).

Men and women should dress modestly in public covering shoulders and knees in public. While the abaya is customary for Saudi women it is not mandatory for female visitors entering Saudi Arabia on a tourist visa.

### **LGBT**

Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Personal Identification**

Foreigners must carry their residency card (Iqama) or their passport with them at all times. Do not surrender your passport.

The Saudi authorities have the right to check identification and this can occur frequently due to the large number of security checkpoints both in the cities and on the roads between cities.

### **Dual Nationality**

The Saudi authorities do not recognise dual nationality and it is illegal to hold two passports in Saudi Arabia.

Second passports even if it is a second Irish passport will be confiscated or ordered destroyed if discovered by the Saudi authorities.

### **Getting married**

Under Saudi Arabia’s customs, in the event of a marriage to a Saudi national, the family has strong power over the individual. If a woman wants her right of movement or to work guaranteed, she must insist on a premarital settlement, stipulating this right. Such agreements are binding and can be relied on in court to settle any disputes.

### **Business activity**

There are a number of significant differences between the legal systems of Ireland and Saudi Arabia.  Detention without charge is permitted and detainees are not always granted fast access to legal representation.  If you are subject to detention the Embassy and your sponsor will try and assist you as quickly as possible.  But please note this can take time or may take place under very limited conditions.

Business people involved in commercial disputes with a Saudi company or individual may be prevented from leaving the country until the dispute is resolved (see more information in the above section on “Travel bans and legal disputes”).
