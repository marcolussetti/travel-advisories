## Health

### **Medical Facilities**

Healthcare facilities in major cities are of a very high standard. However, medical facilities in minor towns or small cities are adequate for routine procedures only.

### **COVID 19**

There is no requirement to provide a COVID-19 vaccination certificate or negative PCR or antigen test certificate to enter the Kingdom.

All visitors intending to visit the Kingdom (excluding residents) must have medical insurance that covers the costs of COVID-19 treatment in outpatient clinics, emergencies and hospitals.
