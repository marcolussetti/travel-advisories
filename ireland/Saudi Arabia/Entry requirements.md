### **Travelling via the causeway from Bahrain**

Irish citizens planning to travel to Saudi Arabia via the causeway from Bahrain should check the terms of their Saudi visa before travelling.

Anyone planning to apply for a visa should seek advice (e.g from their visa agent, the Saudi Embassy or employer) about the visa options available to them. Saudi visas may only allow for entry into the country by air and may prevent you from entering across a land border including via the causeway from Bahrain.

Irish citizens resident in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave and re-enter the country.

### **Passport**

We advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you.

Your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Saudi Arabia.
