## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

All visitors need a visa to enter Saudi Arabia.

Irish citizens can apply for a tourist visa on arrival at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports or online before their trip through the following link:  [**Visit Saudi Arabia | Visit Saudi Official Tourism Site - Visit Saudi Official Website**](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en).

Tourist visas are valid for 360 days from the date of issue. Irish citizens can stay up to a maximum of 90 days in total per visa. Visas cannot be extended and a daily fine will be levied for overstaying a visa.

Muslim tourists can apply for the tourist visa to perform Umrah. A specific visa is required to perform Hajj.

From 1 February 2025 a new vaccination regulation will require any traveller to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia intending to perform Umrah or Hajj or visit the Great Mosque/transit through Umrah Zones to present a certificate of vaccination against meningitis. This compulsory vaccination applies to any traveller intending to travel to the aforementioned areas, regardless of the visa they are travelling on. The vaccine require is Tetravalent meningococcal (ACYW135) and it must be administered at least 10 days before departure to Saudi Arabia.

Irish citizens planning to travel to Saudi Arabia via the causeway from Bahrain should check the terms of their Saudi visa before travelling.  Anyone planning to apply for a visa should seek advice (e.g from their visa agent, the Saudi Embassy or employer) about the visa options available to them. Saudi visas may only allow for entry into the country by air and may prevent you from entering across a land border including via the causeway from Bahrain.

Irish citizens resident in Saudi Arabia will need a valid exit or re-entry permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior to leave and re-enter the country.

### **Passport**

We advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you.

Your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Saudi Arabia.
