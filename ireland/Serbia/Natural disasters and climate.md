## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquakes**

Serbia lies in a seismically active zone. While there has been no serious earthquake in recent years, quakes do occur and earth tremors are common. You should also find out from local contacts or your hotel what do in the event of an earthquake.

### **Forest Fires**

During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires. Always act responsibly when visiting wooded areas and under no circumstances light barbecues or leave any litter behind.
