### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens may travel to Serbia without a visa and stay in Serbia for 90 days within a 6-month period.

As Serbia is not in the EU/EEA, Passport Cards cannot be used to enter Serbia. Passports should be valid for at least 90 days on the day you leave Serbia. It is also advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

Visitors to Serbia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Athens on social media ([**X**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbAthens) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyOfIrelandGreece)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Serbia by dialling:

* Police: 192
* Fire department: 193
* Ambulance: 194
* Roadside assistance: 1987
