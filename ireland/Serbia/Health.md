## Health

Get medical advice before travelling and make sure that you have any vaccinations needed for Serbia and purchase comprehensive travel insurance which covers all intended activities.

### **Medical Facilities**

The level of medical care in Serbia is not comparable to that in Western Europe. Doctors and hospitals will often expect immediate payment, in cash, for health services so if you have been referred to a medical facility for treatment, contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible.

As Serbia is not in the EU, EHIC (formerly E11) card is not valid and will not give you access to the public health system. To access health services, you should therefore take out insurance before visiting Serbia.

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) purchasing a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of â‚¬1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Animal-borne Disease**

Cases of rabid foxes and dogs have been reported in Serbia, usually in parks and the outskirts of major cities, including in areas which had been rabies-free for decades. Be wary of, and try to avoid contact with, stray dogs. If bitten, get medical help as soon as possible.

There is also a risk of exposure to tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas so take precautions to avoid tick bites.

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Mosquito-borne diseases, including West Nile disease can be a problem in Serbia. Take precautions by getting up-to-date medical advice before travel as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. When you arrive, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.
