## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Personal identification**

Visitors should carry a photocopy of their passport at all times.

### **Local culture**

Pride Parades have taken place without incident in recent years, although the EuroPride parade was the subject of protest. Anti-discrimination legislation is in place (although with limited implementation). While there are gay friendly hostels, clubs and other events in Belgrade, the level of public prejudice against homosexuality and the LGBT population is still relatively high and public displays of affection may attract negative attention.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties and usually a lengthy prison sentence.
