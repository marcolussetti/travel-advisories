## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors should carry a photocopy of their passport at all times.

### **Local Culture**

Pride Parades have taken place without incident in recent years, although the EuroPride parade was the subject of protest. Anti-discrimination legislation is in place (although with limited implementation). While there are gay friendly hostels, clubs and other events in Belgrade, the level of public prejudice against homosexuality and the LGBT population is still relatively high and public displays of affection may attract negative attention.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties and usually a lengthy prison sentence.

### **Money**

The official currency of Serbia is the dinar. Credit cards are accepted in most hotels and shops and nearly all ATMs accept international bank cards.

There are many money exchange machines and offices in Belgrade (including at Belgrade airport) that accept euros, sterling and US dollars and will give back dinars. Irish banks do not generally exchange dinars so visitors should exchange any unwanted dinars before leaving Serbia. Only change money through banks or official exchange offices and not through street dealers.

### **Importing Currency**

On arrival in Serbia, declare money in excess of €10,000 (or equivalent) and also items of value intended for personal use and obtain a declaration from custom officials. When departing, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs so that money (up to the amount brought in but not exceeding €10,000 in value) can be taken out again. You will also be asked for a receipt of purchase for dinars you have bought from a foreign bank.

If you do not comply with these rules, your money can be confiscated.
