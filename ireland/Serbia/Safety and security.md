## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

The political situation in Serbia is relatively stable. However, we advise visitors to stay alert at all times, to monitor local media reports and follow the directions of local authorities regarding safety or security risks.

### **Kosovo**

Kosovo formally declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and Ireland fully recognises the Republic of Kosovo as an independent nation. However, the government of Serbia does not recognise Kosovo - there can therefore be tension in the border region on occasion.

### **Demonstrations**

Large demonstrations and political gatherings are a relatively common occurrence in Belgrade, and are mostly peaceful. We strongly recommend avoiding any demonstrations or public gatherings if there are indications that they may turn violent without warning.

### **Photography**

Avoid taking photographs of military and police installations and/or personnel or vehicles anywhere in Serbia, as this may lead to difficulties with the authorities.

### **Landmines**

There are still residual mines and other unexploded ordnance in some areas of South Serbia. Be careful when travelling in the Presevo and Bujanovac districts of South Serbia. Do not stray off main routes, particularly in rural areas, and always check with local contacts or tour operators before travelling to affected regions.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Serbia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Most visits to Serbia are trouble-free but be careful of street crime, such as mugging, bag-snatching and pick-pocketing particularly in larger cities. Take normal, sensible precautions to stay safe:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations, markets and other places frequented by tourists
* Four-wheel-drive and luxury vehicles are a popular target for criminals.
* Isolated incidents of armed violence in major cities are a problem; however, these are usually linked to organised crime and not directed against foreigners.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Serbia, report it to the local police immediately and get a report. Citizens can also contact the Honorary Consul of Ireland in Belgrade if assistance is required.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Serbia, be careful. Road conditions vary considerably, and conditions are worse in rural areas, especially in, and after, bad weather. One particularly poor road is the Ibarska Magistrala (linking Serbia to Montenegro); bad conditions and overcrowding can make it dangerous. Roadworks on the main highways across Serbia (from the Croatian and Hungarian border to Bulgaria and North Macedonia), may cause delays. We advise driving defensively and avoid confrontation with other drivers.

If driving:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and an international driving permit
* Make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance that will cover you in Serbia
* Driving with dipped headlights is compulsory during the day
* Check local developments before starting your journey particularly if you plan to cross a land border with Kosovo

### **Vehicle Documentation**

Visitors could be refused entry into Serbia if they cannot show proof that they own or have hired the vehicle so bring your V5 logbook or hire agreement and a locally valid insurance policy so you can present them to the authorities. European green card vehicle insurance is valid in Serbia but is no longer required. The green card annotation for Serbia is ‘SRB’.

### **Road Tolls**

There are several tollbooths along Serbia’s motorways. Tolls will depend on the size of vehicles and visitors should have at least €200 in cash for toll charges.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

Many Serbian car hire firms will not allow their vehicles to be driven in Kosovo, Bulgaria or Albania due to concerns about the security situation. There have been some incidents where Serbian-registered cars have been targeted in more isolated areas of Kosovo. Check the security situation before setting out on a journey.
