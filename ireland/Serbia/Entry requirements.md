## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens may travel to Serbia without a visa and stay in Serbia for 90 days within a 6 month period.

### Passport

As Serbia is not in the EU/EEA, Passport Cards cannot be used to enter Serbia. Passports should be valid for at least 90 days on the day you leave Serbia. It is also advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Registration**

Visitors must register with the local police within 24 hours of arriving in Serbia. If staying in a hotel or official tourist accommodation, you will be registered automatically on check-in. Failure to register may lead to a fine, detention or a court appearance.

### **Temporary Residency**

If staying in Serbia for longer than 90 days (for the purpose of education, employment, marriage, etc.) you must apply to the local district police for a temporary residence permit before the 90-day period expires. Make sure you file your permit at least 30 days prior to the expiry of your temporary residence. You will need to provide supporting documents with your application.

### **Entering the Country**

Visitors should only enter Serbia through recognised border crossings, where you will receive an entry stamp in your passport from the border police. Visitors may face charges of illegal immigration if they try to leave the country without an entry stamp or exit-entry visa and this could result in a heavy fine or possible imprisonment.

If you are a temporary resident (in the country for more than 90 days) you should have an exit-entry visa as well as a residence stamp in your passport.

### **Recognised Entry Points**

The Serbian government does not recognise entry points from Kosovo or those on Kosovoâ€™s external borders with Albania, Montenegro or North Macedonia (for the list of recognised entry points please refer to the [**Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs**](http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/)). The Serbian authorities will not allow travel into Serbia, from Kosovo, unless you began your journey in Serbia and are returning there directly.

We are also aware of incidents in which foreign nationals have been denied entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports, and even of isolated incidents in which Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals. Visitors are less likely to experience entry problems if they travel into Kosovo from Serbia and are returning via the same route or are travelling via Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro.
