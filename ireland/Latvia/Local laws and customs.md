## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices in case your behaviour is seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

The acquisition and/or possession of narcotic substances is against the law. Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Smoking and Alcohol**

Smoking in public spaces and places is against the law. Smoking is not permitted within 10 meters of the entrances to public or local government institutions. It is best not to smoke close to buildings at all.

Public drunkenness (i.e. in the streets, on public transport, etc.) will be dealt with very severely by the Latvian authorities, who have the right to detain people in detoxification centres if they believe them to be very drunk.

Possession of an open bottle of alcoholic beverage in public places (including on the street, and in parks) in Riga is against the law.

Driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol is against the law.

### **Public order offences**

There have been a small number of cases where Irish citizens have themselves been the perpetrators of public order offences. These are robustly policed in Riga and can result in up to 7 years imprisonment, and/or a hefty fine.

The Freedom Monument, which is at the edge of the Old City, is one of a number of important symbols for Latvians, which should be treated with great respect. It is a criminal offence to defile the Latvian flag or other state symbols and offences of this nature will be prosecuted heavily by the police.

The authorities in RÄ«ga and elsewhere in Latvia often respond to offences by detaining suspects in jail until the case can be heard in court. This generally takes from 7-14 days.
