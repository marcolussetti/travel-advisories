However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you should register your presence and place of residence with the [**Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs**](https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/services/declaration-or-designation-residence).

Visitors to Latvia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
