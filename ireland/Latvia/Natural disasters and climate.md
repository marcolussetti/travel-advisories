## Natural disasters and climate

### **Travelling to Latvia in Winter**

Be prepared for very cold and possibly hazardous weather if travelling to Latvia in winter (October to March). There is likely to be snow on the ground and temperatures may drop to -25 degrees Celsius or below.

### **Localised Flooding**

The spring thaw sometimes causes localised flooding outside of Riga particularly in March and April.
