## Health

Ambulance service for emergencies is available by dialling 113.

Irish citizens do not need any vaccinations when travelling to Latvia but keep be up to date on routine vaccinations while traveling to any destination.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme-disease are widespread throughout Latvia.  Those intending to visit parks or forested areas (even within Riga) are urged to speak with their health care practitioners regarding vaccinations before.

### **Travel Insurance**

We can not pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency expenses**

Insurance policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if you are making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you’re sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities planned that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Please be aware most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

As an Irish resident you are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay there. Ensure that you get or renew your EHIC (the new name for the E111) before you go, and remember, you need one for every person travelling in your group.

Irish residents can apply for your EHIC and find out more information [**here**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Also, some private hospitals may not accept the EHIC please check with the hospital administrator beforehand.
