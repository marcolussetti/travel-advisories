## Entry requirements

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Latvia for short visits but if remaining for longer than 90 days you are required to obtain a residence permit.

When entering Latvia by car and at all times while driving in Latvia, you must carry the original vehicle registration certificate and driving licence.
