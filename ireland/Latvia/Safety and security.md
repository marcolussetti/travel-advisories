## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Latvia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Latvia. However, you should be aware that, as in any major city, there can be a higher risk of petty crime, such as pickpocketing, in tourist areas. While in Riga, if visiting Central Train Station (Dzelzcela stacija) and Central Bus Station (Autoosta), or tourist areas such as Riga’s Old Town (Vecriga) and Central Market (Centraltirgus), we advise you take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and if withdrawing money, do so from ATMs located within a bank
* Be aware of common scams in restaurants and tourist pubs. Pay special attention to drink prices and transactions on your credit and debit cards.
* Do not inadvertently lower your alertness to the risks of drink spiking while abroad. Ensure drinks are not left unattended.

### **Reporting Crime**

If victim of a crime while in Latvia, report it to the local police immediately, call 110 or 112, before contacting the [**Irish Embassy in Riga**](/en/latvia/riga/).

### **Riga City Tourism Police**

The Riga City Tourist Police Department provides a 24-hour English-language service for tourists to Riga in difficulties, or who would like to register a complaint about their treatment in Riga.  The telephone number to call is +371 67181818.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

If your passport is lost or stolen in Rīga, firstly report the loss or theft to the police station at Matīsa iela 9 (between Brīvības and Tērbatas iela, ph: +371 67086200). This station is responsible for the Old City area.

The police will issue a report confirming that you have reported the passport as lost or stolen. Please present this report when applying to the Embassy for a replacement travel document. Two passport photographs are required, an alternative form of identification and an administrative fee of 30 EUR.  You should contact the Embassy as soon as you obtain the police report to arrange for the production of an Emergency Travel Document. Photographs are available from photographic shops and, outside of normal hours, at a kiosk in Rīga’s international bus station (Prāgas iela 1, near the Central Market). Access is available 24 hours through the side entrance.

### **Driving and Pedestrians**

If driving in Latvia, please be extremely careful. Latvia has the highest rate per capita, of road deaths in the EU.

Pedestrians should exercise good care when crossing the streets, even when the ‘green man’ signal is displayed, as drivers may have a green light at the same time.

When entering Latvia by car and at all times while driving in Latvia, you must have your driver's licence original vehicle registration, insurance certificates with you.

If driving, it is recommended to:

* Bring your international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* It is forbidden to drive while smoking or using a cell phone.
* Use dimmed headlights at all times

### **Car Rental**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public Transport**

Travellers on public transport should be aware that on the spot fines will be imposed if found travelling without a ticket or with a ticket which has not been validated.

### **Taxis**

For safety be wary of smaller or independent operators as they often over-charge foreigners especially from the airport. Companies or apps that confirm your taxi number beforehand should be used. There is a standard cost taxi voucher available from Riga Airport from the airport’s visitor centre.
