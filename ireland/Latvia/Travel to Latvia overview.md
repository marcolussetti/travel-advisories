### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Latvia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Latvia. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you should register your presence and place of residence with the [**Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs**](https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/services/declaration-or-designation-residence).

Visitors to Latvia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrelandinLV**](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2FIrelandinLV) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassy.latvia)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Latvia by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:
