### **Travel Alert**

#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Riga for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

There is no change to entry requirements for Latvian passport holders travelling directly to Ireland without transiting through the UK.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Latvia.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Latvia. However, if you are staying for longer than three months, you should register your presence and place of residence with the [**Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs**](https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/services/declaration-or-designation-residence).

Visitors to Latvia are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrelandinLV**](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2FIrelandinLV) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassy.latvia)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

#### **Belarus Border**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to [**Belarus**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/belarus/) at this time due to the extent of Russian military operations in the country in connection with the widespread military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the increasingly restricted options for Irish citizens in Belarus to depart the country.

Please note that a number of land border crossings between Belarus and EU Member States, including Latvia, have been closed in recent times. The Paternieki-Grigorovshchina border crossing point is the only crossing point between Latvia and Belarus that remains open. This border crossing may close or implement restrictions at short notice. Check the latest information on the [**Latvian State Border Guard website**](https://www.rs.gov.lv/en).

From 15 October 2025, vehicles intending to cross the Latvia-Belarus border must now register in advance on the Electronic Queue Reservation System (ERRS). The ERRS can be accessed on the following sites: [**www.lvborder.lv**](http://www.lvborder.lv/) and [**www.lvrobeza.lv**](http://www.lvrobeza.lv/).

Access to within 2km of Latvia’s border with Belarus is limited. If you wish to enter the border area, you are required to obtain a special licence issued by the Latvian Border Guard. You should abide by this limitation at all times and follow the instructions of Latvian authorities if you are in this area.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Latvia by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 110/102
* Fire brigade: 113/103
* Ambulance: 114/104
