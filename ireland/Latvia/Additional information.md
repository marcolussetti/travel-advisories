## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Latvia for short visits but if remaining for longer than 90 days you are required to obtain a residence permit.

When entering Latvia by car and at all times while driving in Latvia, you must carry the original vehicle registration certificate and driving licence.

### **Identification**

Visitors are recommended to carry ID in public at all times. It may be advisable to email copies of your passport to yourself before departure or to take a number of photocopies of it along with you.

### **Travelling to Latvia in winter**

Be prepared for very cold and possibly hazardous weather if travelling to Latvia in winter (October to March). There is likely to be snow on the ground and temperatures may drop to -25 degrees Celsius or below.

### **Localised flooding**

The spring thaw sometimes causes localised flooding outside of Riga particularly in March and April.

### **Customs regulations**

A special antiques export permit is necessary if you purchase an icon, book, painting or other cultural item that is 50 years old or more, or costs above 300 EUR. This can be sought from the State Inspection for Heritage Protection, 19 Mazā Pils Street, Rīga (ph.:  +371 67229272).
