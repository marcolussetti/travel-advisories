### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to the Central African Republic and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in the Central African Republic there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.
