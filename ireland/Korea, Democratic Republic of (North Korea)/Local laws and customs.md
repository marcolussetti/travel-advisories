## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local culture**

Reserved behaviour in public is the norm. Public displays of affection are not customary in Korean culture.

Avoid bringing religious books or any material that could be considered to be “anti-North Korean”.

### **LGBT**

While there are no laws expressly prohibiting same-sex relationships in North Korea, homosexuality is not openly discussed and would not be considered acceptable by the authorities.

### **Local travel**

Travel within North Korea is severely restricted. Carry identification papers at all times. Visitors will almost always be accompanied by a guide and will only be allowed to go to locations where the guide gives approval. For travel outside Pyongyang, it’s your guide's responsibility to get the necessary permissions. Military checkpoints at the entry and exit to provinces, counties and towns usually require proof of identity before allowing travel onward.

Foreigners who live in Pyongyang are usually able to travel freely within designated parts of the city, but permission is needed for travel outside of Pyongyang.

It is currently not possible to travel direct to South Korea from North Korea

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photography**

Restrictions on the use of cameras has eased somewhat, though we recommend always ensuring the guide’s permission before taking a photograph. Avoid taking photographs of officials or guarded or protected buildings.
