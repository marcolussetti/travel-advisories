### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises against non-essential travel to North Korea at this time.

In recent years, the number of missiles tests carried out by North Korea have increased significantly, underscoring the underlying unpredictability of the situation. The Embassy in Seoul is monitoring the situation and advises Irish citizens in Korea to be aware of and follow developments and to ensure that you are [**registered with the Embassy**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/).

The political leadership in North Korea is the object of intense, organised reverence and lack of courtesy or perceived insults to, or jokes about, the North Korean political system and its leadership are severely frowned upon. If you travel to North Korea, you should avoid taking photographs of soldiers and officials or guarded or protected buildings. Reserved behaviour in public is the norm.

Because there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in North Korea, we are limited in the support we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Seoul.**](/en/republic-of-korea/seoul/)

Irish citizens require a visa to enter the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). For more information on entry to North Korea, please see the Entry requirements tab.
