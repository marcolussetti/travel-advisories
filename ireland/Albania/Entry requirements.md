## Entry requirements

### Visa/Passport

Irish citizens do not need a visa for short visits to Albania (up to 90 days). However, make sure your passport is valid for a minimum period of six months from your date of entry into Albania. Although Albania is not in the EU, the Albanian authorities do accept Irish Passport Cards for entry into Albania via Tirana International Airport. However, it is preferable to travel on a full Irish passport.
