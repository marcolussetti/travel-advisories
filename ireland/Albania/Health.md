### **Travel Insurance**

We can not pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. If an appropriate travel insurance policy is purchased, these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure the policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Policies should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Albania are required.

### **Medical Facilities**

The level of medical care is not comparable to that in Western Europe, and medical and dental facilities (including those for accident and emergency use) are very poor, particularly outside Tirana. It is recommended to take out comprehensive insurance before travelling to Albania, to ensure access to private health care, air ambulance evacuation and repatriation if necessary.

### **Hepatitis**

There are high levels of Hepatitis in Albania. Learn more about Hepatitis on the [**HSE’s website**](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/hepatitis/).

### **Tick-borne Encephalitis**

Cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been reported in North Albania. A vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis is available if planning to travel to this area. As an additional precaution, keep all areas of your body covered when close to shrubs or bushes, and inspect yourself regularly for ticks.

### **Rabies**

Rabies is also a matter of concern as there are large numbers of stray dogs, although there have been no reports of the disease in Tirana at present. Learn more about Rabies on the [**HSE’s website**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/zoonotic/rabies/factsheet/).

### **Water**

The tap water in Albania may cause illness; only drink bottled water.
