## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

Irish citizens do not need a visa for short visits to Albania (up to 90 days). However, make sure your passport is valid for a minimum period of six months from your date of entry into Albania. Although Albania is not in the EU, the Albanian authorities do accept Irish Passport Cards for entry into Albania via Tirana International Airport. However, it is preferable to travel on a full Irish passport.

### **Credit cards**

Major credit/debit cards are accepted in most banks and international hotels. You may prefer to use cash, as in the past foreigners have been victims of credit card fraud.

### **Natural disasters and climate**

If travelling to Albania, make sure you know what to expect â€“ then plan and pack so that you are prepared. If there is a serious incident, co-operate with local authorities and emergency services.

* The rainy season, usually between December and February, can cause severe flooding, particularly in the north of Albania.
* Albania lies in a seismically active zone. While there has been no serious earthquake in recent years, quakes do happen and earth tremors are common.
