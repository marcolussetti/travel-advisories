## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Albania is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Albania but you should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Be aware that ownership of firearms is widespread in Albania.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Albania, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact us at the Irish Embassy in Athens if help is needed.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Albania, be extremely careful. Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Roads are poor except for those linking the main cities and there is no street lighting outside of the cities so night travel is best avoided. There is no national car recovery system, so cars should be self-sufficient, carrying minor repair equipment, local phrase book, first aid kit, water and overnight food when in remote areas.

If driving:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* If involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you must wait until the police arrive.
* Be aware that drivers with foreign licensed vehicles draw particular scrutiny from the Road Traffic Police.
* Be aware that many parts of Albania are very mountainous, and there can be heavy snowfall in winter. Cars should have adequate winter tyres, and drivers should be aware that some roads may be impassable during winter months. Public transport may also be disrupted.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
