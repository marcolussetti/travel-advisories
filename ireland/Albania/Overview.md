### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not need a visa for short visits to Albania (up to 90 days). However, passports must be valid for a minimum period of six months from date of entry into Albania. Although Albania is not in the EU, the Albanian authorities do accept Irish Passport Cards for entry into Albania via Tirana International Airport. However, be advised that it is preferable to travel on a full Irish passport.

Visitors to Albania are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Athens on social media ([**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbAthens) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/EmbassyOfIrelandGreece)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Lost/Stolen Passports**

Lost or stolen Irish passports need to be notified to the Albanian authorities on the [**e-Albania website**.](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiUgK7W8MuFAxWTaEEAHVmTDvIQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fe-albania.al%2F&usg=AOvVaw33Mt6ra-W-Yb5hCSAslNRo&opi=89978449) It can take a minimum of three days for a statement of loss to be issued.

Please note that a statement of loss may be required if you need an emergency travel document to return to Ireland, or to apply online for a replacement passport.

### **Natural Disasters and Climate**

Albania lies in a seismically active zone, particularly in the southern half of the country. Tremors are common, and more serious earthquakes may occur.

The rainy season, usually between December and February, can cause severe flooding, particularly in the north of Albania. Northern Albania also experiences heavy snow during winter months, especially in upland areas.

If there is a serious incident, visitors should co-operate with local authorities and emergency services.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Albanian local emergency service telephone numbers are:

* 129 for police.
* 126 for road police.
* 127 for ambulance.
* 128 for fire department.
