## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Law Enforcement**

The Albanian authorities do not always inform the Irish Embassy when Irish nationals have been arrested. If detained, insist on your right to contact an Irish Embassy Consular Officer.

### **Credit Cards**

Major credit/debit cards are accepted in most banks and international hotels. You may prefer to use cash, as in the past foreigners have been victims of credit card fraud.
