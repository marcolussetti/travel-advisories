## Entry requirements

### Visa

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Equatorial Guinea and can now apply online for an [**electronic visa**](https://equatorialguinea-evisa.com/).

If unsure about the entry requirements for Equatorial Guinea, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the countryâ€™s nearest Embassy or Consulate

Also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Equatorial Guinea and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Equatorial Guinea there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.

Citizens should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what is needed to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise on the fees which apply.
