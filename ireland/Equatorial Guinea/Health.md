### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that citizens obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that the policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

The yellow fever vaccination is an entry requirement for Equatorial Guinea and a yellow fever vaccination certificate will be requested by border control on arrival in the country.

Check what other vaccinations that may be required for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, information can be obtained from a GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Factsheet - Health Protection Surveillance Centre (hpsc.ie)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/polio/factsheet/#:~:text=Polio%20vaccination%20is%20part%20of,is%20lifelong%20following%20complete%20vaccination.)

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for the entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case your medication is lost.
