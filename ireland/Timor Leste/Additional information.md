## Additional information

### **Entry permits**

**It is not possible to receive an entry permit when you arrive at the land border** **with West Timor** so if you want to enter Timor Leste via the border with Indonesia, you need to get an entry permit in advance from the [**Immigration Department of Timor Leste**](http://migracao.gov.tl/?page_id=32).

Travellers arriving in the country by air, can receive an entry permit on arrival at Dili Airport. An entry permit is normally issued for visits of up to 30 days. Fees for these permits can change regularly so you should check with the Immigration Department for up-to-date information about the entry permit.

### **Passports**

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Timor-Leste. It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Timor-Leste and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay. Damaged passports will result in being denied entry by immigration officials.

### **Health**

Medical services in Timor-Leste are limited, particularly outside Dili. There are very few dental and optical services. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to Australia or Singapore is likely to be the only option for treatment. Irish citizens are advised to **make sure they have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.**

For emergency medical assistance, **dial 110** and ask for an ambulance. Travellers are advised to contact their insurance/medical assistance company promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether anti-malarial medication is needed. To avoid mosquito bites it is advisable to use bed nets and repellents, and to wear closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [**Timor Leste authorities**](http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?lang=en) to ensure the medication is legal in Timor-Leste.

Malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis and Japanese encephalitis are common throughout Timor-Leste. There is usually an increase in dengue cases during the rainy season, which runs from November to April.

### **Water**

We recommend that drinking only boiled or bottled water.
