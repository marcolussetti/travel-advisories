## Health

### **Travel Insurance / Medical Treatment**

Medical services in Timor-Leste are limited, particularly outside Dili. There are very few dental and optical services. In the event of a medical emergency, evacuation to Australia or Singapore is likely to be the only option for treatment. Irish citizens are advised to **make sure they have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.**

For emergency medical assistance, **dial 110** and ask for an ambulance. Travellers are advised to contact their insurance/medical assistance company promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Malaria / Dengue Fever / Tuberculosis / Japanese Encephalitis**

Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether anti-malarial medication is needed. To avoid mosquito bites it is advisable to use bed nets and repellents, and to wear closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [**Timor Leste authorities**](http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?lang=en) to ensure the medication is legal in Timor-Leste.

Malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis and Japanese encephalitis are common throughout Timor-Leste. There is usually an increase in dengue cases during the rainy season, which runs from November to April.

### **Water**

We recommend that drinking only boiled or bottled water.
