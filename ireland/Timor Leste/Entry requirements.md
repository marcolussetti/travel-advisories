## Entry requirements

### **Entry Permit**

**It is not possible to receive an entry permit when you arrive at the land border** **with West Timor** so if you want to enter Timor Leste via the border with Indonesia, you need to get an entry permit in advance from the [**Immigration Department of Timor Leste**](http://migracao.gov.tl/?page_id=32).

Travellers arriving in the country by air, can receive an entry permit on arrival at Dili Airport. An entry permit is normally issued for visits of up to 30 days. Fees for these permits can change regularly so you should check with the Immigration Department for up-to-date information about the entry permit.

### **Passport**

Passports must be valid for at least six months from date of entry into Timor-Leste. It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Timor-Leste and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay. Damaged passports will result in being denied entry by immigration officials.
