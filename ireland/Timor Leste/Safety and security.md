## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime is a problem in Timor-Leste, including gang-related violence, robbery (in some cases armed), assault and attacks on vehicles.

There have been a number of attacks on foreigners in Dili, including bag-snatchings, during the hours of daylight and darkness. Be vigilant at all times and avoid displaying expensive items of jewellery or carrying large sums of money. There have been reports of harassment and violence against women.

There are occasional violent incidents at nightclubs in Dili.

There are occasional incidents of fighting between groups in various districts around Timor-Leste, often but not always related to martial arts groups. These incidents often involve stone throwing and occasionally machetes and knives. Most happen at night.

### **Terrorism**

There is a low threat from terrorism, but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.

### **Local travel**

Take care if you go outside after dark. Avoid travelling alone or to isolated areas.

In rural areas there is a danger from unexploded ordnance from World War II and the Indonesian occupation. Donâ€™t stray off well-used roads and paths.

Crocodiles have been seen at beaches and inland waterways near Dili, and attacks have been reported.

Be particularly vigilant in border areas.

### **Road travel**

Poor road quality and an increasing number of cars, especially in Dili, make driving in Timor-Leste hazardous. Accidents are frequent. Drive with doors locked and windows up.

Drivers must hold a current driving licence valid for the class of vehicle they plan to drive. Third Party motor vehicle insurance is not available.

Take extra care when it is wet. Travel in convoy whenever possible. Main routes are often single-track mountain roads, which can deteriorate rapidly and become impassable, particularly during the rainy season (December-April).

### **Sea travel**

There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in neighbouring waters. Mariners should be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas onboard and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.

### **Political situation**

Avoid any demonstrations and large crowds, as these have the potential to deteriorate quickly and turn violent.

Make sure your travel documents are up-to-date and available in case you need to leave at short notice. Keep a photocopy of the relevant pages of your passport to avoid any complications.
