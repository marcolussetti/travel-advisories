## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime is prevalent in Colombia - take sensible precautions.

### **Petty Crime**

Petty theft, such as pick-pocketing and bag-snatching, is relatively common in Colombia, including at the airport in Bogotá, on public transport, and near hotels. Take care of personal belongings and avoid obvious displays of wealth. Avoid using mobile phones on the street. Credit card and ATM fraud occurs, as well as card overcharging, especially in popular tourist areas.

### **Tourist scams**

There have been reports, including in Bogotá, of bogus policemen approaching foreigners to inspect documents or foreign currency. If approached, avoid handing over money or documents, unless threatened, and try to stay in busy areas.

### **Street Crime and Drug-induced robberies**

Street crime is a problem in major cities, including Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Santa Marta. Mugging and pickpocketing can be accompanied by violence.

The use of drugs by criminals in Colombia to subdue their victims is relatively frequent. Drugs such as scopolamine can be administered through food, drinks, cigarettes, aerosols and even paper flyers, and can temporarily incapacitate the victim, leaving them vulnerable to robbery and other crimes.

Citizens should be particularly vigilant in bars and nightclubs, where in particular young women have been reported to target foreign men with scopolamine. Dating applications and websites are also used by criminals to identify and lure foreign nationals.

Where possible, visitors should plan how they will travel to and from their destination. Only use pre-booked taxis. Avoid travelling alone or at night, especially at border crossings or areas where there are few other people around.

### **Serious crime**

Though the security situation in Colombia has improved in recent years, terrorism and serious criminal activities remain significant threats.

The threat comes from the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents from the demobilised FARC guerrilla group (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), and other illegal armed groups. In January 2019, the ELN conducted a bombing on a police academy in Bogota, killing 23 people.

A high level of caution should be exercised against street crime in major cities such as Bogotá, Medellín and Cali. Avoid unnecessary visits to deprived areas of all Colombian cities. In Bogotá, be vigilant in areas to the south of Candelaria and to the west of the airport road as these parts of the city are particularly dangerous. Exercise caution on city streets, especially after dark.

Foreigners have been known to be victims of 'express kidnapping', which can occur after hailing taxis on the street.

Criminal gangs are active in all of the Departments where coca is cultivated, processed or transported, as well as in many cities. The risk is particularly significant in rural areas near the borders with Panama, Venezuela and Ecuador; in the Parque Nacional Natural de La Macarena in the Department of Meta; and the port towns of Buenaventura in the Department of Valle de Cauca, Turbo in the Department of Antioquia and Tumaco in the Department of Nariño.

### **Kidnapping**

There is a risk of kidnapping from both terrorist and criminal groups. While Colombians are the primary targets, foreigners can also be targeted, especially those working for (or perceived to be working for) oil, mining and related companies. Take particular care when travelling alone, using ATMs, or travelling in or near tugurios (slum areas).

Regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.

### **Political unrest**

Demonstrations and protests take place regularly throughout Colombia, especially in large cities. These can be confrontational and can turn violent rapidly. Avoid large crowds, political rallies, demonstrations and any large public protests or gatherings.

Protests and demonstrations can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Protesters or criminal groups may set up roadblocks, especially in rural areas.

Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

### **Border security**

The Colombia-Venezuela border region is currently volatile. We advise against all travel to Colombia's border regions with Venezuela until further notice. Do not use any of the Colombia-Venezuela land crossings.

To cross by land between Colombia and Ecuador, only use the crossing on the Pan-American Highway, at Ipiales. Do not stop en route between the border and Pasto.

Avoid crossing between Panama and Colombia by land. The 'Darien Gap' is a dangerous area renowned for the presence of several illegal armed groups, illegal migration, and drugs trafficking. There is no road crossing between Colombia and Panama.

### **Landmines**

Colombia is affected by landmines and unexploded ordnance. Mined areas are frequently unmarked so be aware of potential dangers when visiting remote locations or venturing off the main road.

### **Lost or stolen passports**

It can take up to three weeks to replace a lost or stolen passport, due to time and distance factors. Please take extreme care with passports and other personal documentation. Getting a replacement passport will be easier with a copy of the lost or stolen one, so keep photocopies while travelling.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Colombia, report it to the local police immediately. Many insurance companies will only compensate loss from theft if a police report is provided. Police can take a report of a crime from travellers in person in any local police station known as CAI (Centro de Atencion Inmediata). Online police reports can also be filed on the [**National Police website**](https://adenunciar.policia.gov.co/Adenunciar/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fAdenunciar)

Contact the Irish Embassy in Bogotá if assistance is required.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, the Embassy advises not to hand over passports as a form of security. If allowing passports to be photocopied, keep them in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Taxis**

Where possible, plan how you will travel to and from your destination. Only use pre-booked taxis. We strongly advise against hailing taxis from the street.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Colombia, be extremely careful. Driving and road standards are variable. Travel by road outside the major cities, including by public transport, is dangerous. If visitors want to drive:

* Bring an international driving license and make sure adequate and appropriate insurance is purchased.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and visitors risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
