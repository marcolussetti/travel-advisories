### **Water rationing in Bogota**

Bogota’s Mayor announced measures for water rationing across the city as the main water reservoirs have dropped to critically low levels. The city and surrounding towns have been divided into nine areas with water cuts off for 24 hours in each area on a rotation that will reset every 10 days. The measure will not affect schools, hospitals, and other institutions that serve vulnerable populations. Fines may be imposed for irresponsible actions that lead to water waste.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to visit Colombia for periods of up to 90 days. When entering the country, they may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel.

A valid passport is required for travel to Colombia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

All travelers arriving in Colombia are required to register their details on the Colombian government’s [**CheckMig application**](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/pre-registro)  within 72 hours prior to boarding an inbound or outbound flight.

Entry and exit requirements are subject to change. All citizens should consult the Colombian Ministry of Health and/or consult their local Colombian Embassy for up-to-date information on updates in entry requirements.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if problems arise, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Colombia by dialling 123.

In the event of an emergency, contact the Irish Embassy in Bogotá. Contact details can be found under the "Embassy Contact" tab. If calling outside of working hours, leave a message giving:

* Your name;
* The reason for calling;
* Where you are now;
* Contact details (mobile phone number or phone number of where you are staying).

The Embassy regularly monitors these messages and one of our staff members will be in contact.

The Embassy advises Irish citizens in Colombia to remain vigilant if in the vicinity of large gatherings and to monitor local news at all times.

The Colombia-Venezuela border region is currently volatile. The Embassy strongly advises against all travel to Colombia's border regions with Venezuela until further notice. Do not use any of the Colombia-Venezuela land crossings.
