### **Travel Alert**

April 2025 - The Colombian Government has declared a national health emergency due to an increase in Yellow Fever cases, with the Departments of Tolima and Cundinamarca registering the highest numbers of cases. Irish citizens travelling to Colombia are advised to get vaccinated against Yellow Fever at least 10 days prior to travel.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to visit Colombia for periods of up to 90 days. When entering the country, they may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel.

A valid passport is required for travel to Colombia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Colombian authorities advise to travellers to register their details on the ‘[Check-Mig Form'](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/pre-registro) form on Migración Colombia. Although this is not mandatory, it might speed up your entry to the country. You can complete the form within 72 hours prior to boarding an inbound or outbound flight.

Entry and exit requirements are subject to change. All citizens should contact Migracion Colombia and/or consult their local Colombian Embassy for up-to-date information on updates in entry requirements.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on X [**@EmbCol\_Ireland**](https://twitter.com/embcol_ireland) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if problems arise, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Colombia by dialling 123.

In the event of an emergency, contact the Irish Embassy in Bogotá. Contact details can be found under the "Embassy Contact" tab. If calling outside of working hours, leave a message giving:

* Your name;
* The reason for calling;
* Where you are now;
* Contact details (mobile phone number or phone number of where you are staying).

The Embassy regularly monitors these messages and one of our staff members will be in contact.

The Embassy advises Irish citizens in Colombia to remain vigilant if in the vicinity of large gatherings and to monitor local news at all times.

The Colombia-Venezuela border region is currently volatile. The Embassy strongly advises against all travel to Colombia's border regions with Venezuela until further notice. Do not use any of the Colombia-Venezuela land crossings.
