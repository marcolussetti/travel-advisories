## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

Irish citizens do not need a visa to visit Colombia for periods of up to 90 days. When entering the country, you may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel.

Irish passports should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Colombia. Entry requirements change from time to time, so check these requirements before departure with the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate of Colombia.**](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/embajadas-consulados-colombia-exterior)

### **Health**

In many cities and municipalities, the wearing of facemasks is no longer mandatory in certain indoor and outdoor spaces. It is still required in elderly homes, hospitals, public transport and indoor spaces at educational facilities. Citizens should check with local authorities for up-to-date information on any restrictions that may be in place in their locality.

Medical facilities in Colombia vary widely in quality. In larger cities, private clinics usually provide good quality care, whereas public health facilities and those in smaller cities may be of poorer quality.

Before travel, travellers should make sure to have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Foreign nationals who violate immigration laws in Colombia (e.g. by overstaying a visa) will not be permitted to access Colombia's public health system.

### **Altitude sickness**

Travellers to many parts of Colombia, including Bogotá, are at risk of developing altitude sickness. Get advice from a doctor before travel, particularly if carrying out activities such as hiking in high-altitude areas.

### **Drinking water**

Tap water is safe to drink only in Bogotá. In all other areas of Colombia, only drink bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

### **Yellow fever**

Yellow fever vaccination certificate is required to enter Colombia for travellers aged 1 year or over arriving from Brazil, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda and for travellers having transited for more than 12 hours through an airport from the countries mentioned above.  Such certificates are also mandatory to enter certain high-risk regions and national parks in Colombia (including Tayrona National Park).

If travelling on to neighbouring countries in Latin America from Colombia, travellers may not be allowed to do so without production of a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate. Confirm with the authorities of any next planned destinations whether they require a certificate following visiting Colombia.

WHO advice for international travel in relation to Yellow Fever can be found on the [**WHO website**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever).

### **Malaria**

There is a high incidence of malaria in low-land tropical areas, particularly in Choco and north-western Antioquia. Take medical advice on anti-malarial medication prior to travel, and after arrival, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Dengue fever**

In July 2023, Colombian health authorities reported a dengue outbreak with 53,000 cases recorded in municipalities such as Meta, Tolima, Cundinamarca, Sucre, Santander, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Atlantico, Cordoba and Guajira. Citizens visiting a tropical or subtropical area should use insect repellent, wear loose clothing, sleep under a mosquito net and be aware of their environment. Dengue mosquitoes breed in still water in urban areas.

### **Zika virus**

There have been outbreaks of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/).

### **Chikungunya virus**

Cases of chikungunya virus have been reported in Colombia. As with other mosquito-borne viruses, all precautions should be taken to avoid bites.

### **Ayahuasca (yage) ceremonies**

Spiritual cleansing and ayahuasca ceremonies, offered by shamans and other individuals, have led to serious illness, injury, assault and even death. Ceremonies involve consuming substances that are not regulated and can cause medical complications and severely impair cognitive and physical abilities. Spiritual cleansing or yage retreats often take place in remote areas, making access to medical attention difficult for those who need it.
