## Safety and security

### **Extreme Weather in the Caribbean Region**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/). Citizens with plans to be in the affected region during this period should consider the need to travel based on information relating to extreme weather projections.

### **Transport**

Vehicles travel on the left side of the road in Saint Lucia. Roads are reasonably well paved but may be poorly marked, narrow and winding, with steep inclines/declines.

When using minibus or taxi services, travellers should agree to a fare ahead of time.

If you’re planning to drive be careful and take these simple precautions:

* Bring your full Irish and international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights.
* Vehicles may stop without warning so always maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front.

### **Swimming**

Take great care at all times when swimming at all times, not all beaches have lifeguards or warning signs.
