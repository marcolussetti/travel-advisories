## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy St Lucia, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the Irish Embassy in [**Ottawa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/canada/ottawa/)**.**

If you need urgent assistance outside of working hours Monday to Friday, you can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on +353 1 408 2000 or the Embassy of Ireland in Ottawa.
