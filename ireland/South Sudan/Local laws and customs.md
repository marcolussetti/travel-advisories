## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Local Customs**

Conservative standards of dress and behaviour are expected in South Sudan, particularly in rural areas. Visitors should take care not to offend and, if in doubt, seek local advice.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexual activity is illegal and the subject is taboo for the majority of South Sudanese.

### **Illegal Drugs**

There are severe penalties for drug trafficking in South Sudan.

### **Sexual Behaviour**

Extramarital relations are not culturally accepted.

### **Personal Identification**

Take several photocopies of your passport with you and carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Photography**

All photography in South Sudan requires a formal photographic permit from the government. Visitors can get a permit by applying to the Ministry of Information. We advise against all photography close to government buildings, military installations, public utilities (including petrol stations), and other sensitive areas (e.g. bridges, airports, etc.).

### **Bars and Nightclubs**

The Ministry of the Interior has stipulated a closing time of 11pm for bars and midnight for nightclubs within Juba city. Be aware of these closing times because being in a bar or nightclub after these times may result in a police encounter and possible arrest or detention.

### **Money**

South Sudan is a cash-based society. Credit and debit cards, travellers' cheques, and cash cards are not accepted in South Sudan. You cannot get cash against credit cards at banks, and credit cards are not acceptable at hotels to settle bills. Nor is it possible to cash travellersâ€™ cheques through the local banking system in South Sudan.

Visitors should be prepared to pay cash (local currency or post-2006 US dollars) for all purchases in South Sudan, including hotel bills.

Make sure you have enough hard currency, preferably US dollars, to cover expenses during your stay. Businesses in South Sudan will generally not accept US dollars printed before 2006, or notes that have tears or are otherwise damaged. Check that the notes you bring with you are relatively new and in good condition.

There are no international ATMs currently available in Juba.
