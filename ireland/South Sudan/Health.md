## Health

In South Sudan, including in Juba, medical facilities are well below Western standards. Specialised doctors, surgeons and operating facilities are inadequate in Juba and do not exist elsewhere. Most serious medical problems would need medical evacuation to Nairobi (Kenya) or Kampala (Uganda).

Be aware that during the rainy season flights are often forced to remain on the ground for hours. Therefore, if you have medical problems you should carefully consider these limitations before travelling.

### **Insect-borne diseases**

Insect-borne diseases are common in South Sudan and may include chloroquine resistant forms of plasmodium falciparum malaria, leishmaniasis and dracunculiasis. Nairobi flies are common during certain periods of the year, following heavy rains.

### **Water- and food-borne diseases**

Water and food-borne diseases are common in South Sudan. These include salmonella, cholera, typhoid, shigella, giardia, hepatitis A and amoebiasis.

### **Travel insurance**

We strongly recommend to take out comprehensive [**travel insurance**](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that will cover any overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation.

### **Vaccinations**

Yellow fever vaccination is a requirement for entry into South Sudan. Before travelling to South Sudan, consult a doctor regarding necessary vaccinations.
