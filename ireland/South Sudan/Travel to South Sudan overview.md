## Travel to South Sudan overview

### **Security Status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to South Sudan, including the capital Juba. If you have no pressing need to remain, we recommend that you leave if it is safe to do so. Irish nationals choosing to stay in South Sudan should remain alert to the local security situation, monitor the media and stay in a safe location. Citizens who are outside Juba, should exercise their own judgement, based on knowledge of the local situation, on whether it is safer to try to reach Juba or remain where they are.

The regions outside of Juba and the border areas with Sudan and Ethiopia are extremely unstable. There is a high risk of armed violence and criminality. The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents or attacks on vehicles by armed groups. Other border areas, including those with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Central African Republic (CAR) are also highly unstable.

If you have any concerns please contact the [**Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/ethiopia/addisababa/), or our Consular Assistance Unit in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

### **General Travel Advice**

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to South Sudan at this time due to high risk to personal safety because of armed conflict, unpredictable political dynamics, and risk of harm in natural disasters throughout the year.
