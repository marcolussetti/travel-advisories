#### **UK ETA**

**Exemption for Irish Citizens, including Irish dual citizens, travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area:**

The UK has introduced a new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for people travelling to, or transiting through, the UK, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man from outside the Common Travel Area. **Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, do not need and therefore are ineligible to apply for an ETA. Under UK entry requirements, you must present a valid Irish passport at UK border control to demonstrate that you are exempt from the ETA requirement**.

You are advised to check your passport validity, and where necessary, apply for an Irish passport, well in advance of any travel. Where travel is required owing to an emergency, Irish citizens, including Irish dual citizens, who are not in possession of a valid Irish passport can contact the Embassy of Ireland in Paris, or nearest Consulate, for advice.

Further information on the ETA is available at [Get an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to visit the UK: Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/eta)

#### **National Threat Level**

Since March 2025, France has maintained its national security threat level at level 3, ‘attack emergency’ (urgence attentat). This is the highest level in the French Vigipirate security programme.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter France.

Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter France.

Visitors to France are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media. While in France, citizens must carry photo ID at all times.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy in Paris and Consulate in Lyon on social media X: [**@IrlEmbParis**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbParis), [**@Irlande\_Lyon**](https://twitter.com/Irlande_Lyon) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Temporary Reintroduction of Border Controls**

There are increased checks and controls at France's borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain until 4 April 2026.

Travellers should be aware of potential delays and additional documentation requirements during this period.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if problems arise, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

* Ambulance: 15
