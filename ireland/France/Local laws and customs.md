## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties. Anyone found in possession of illegal drugs or smuggled goods, can be held in pre-trial detention for the period of the investigation (which can last for several months or even years). If your vehicle was carrying illegal drugs or smuggled goods, French Customs can impound it for the investigation period.

### **Buying property in France**

If planning to buy property in France, we strongly advise to consult an independent legal advisor from the beginning of the process. Be aware that as a property owner, you may be liable for annual taxes on the value of your property.

The Embassy cannot advise on buying property or intervene in property disputes.
