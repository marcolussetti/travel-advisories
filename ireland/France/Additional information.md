## Additional information

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in France, remember that traffic travels on the right. If not used to driving on the right, be extra cautious, particularly at junctions, where traffic coming from the right has priority.

If you want to drive:

* Bring an international driving licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance. You must be at least 18 to drive in France and learner permits are not valid.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught. If your licence is confiscated, you will not be allowed to continue driving and your vehicle will be impounded unless another fully-licensed driver is available to drive it.
* Be aware of and adhere to France’s traffic laws, such as speed limits. Speed cameras are common and the French police are vigilant.
* Visitors are legally obligated to have a single use breathalyser in their vehicle (including motorcycles). We advise to carry at least two breathalysers that carry the ‘NF’ label and comply with French regulations at all times.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* An Air Quality Certificate to classify vehicles based on air pollutant emission levels ad is mandatory for all vehicles in Paris, Grenoble and Lyon. All motorised vehicles (including cars, motorbikes and trucks) must display a Crit'Air sticker - including foreign-registered vehicles. Visitors can [**apply online**](https://certificat-air.gouv.fr/en/) and the sticker will be posted. On days where certain cities are at risk of reaching their Euro emissions limit, heavily polluting vehicles may be refused entrance based on the Crit'Air sticker they are displaying on the windscreen. Failure to display a sticker may result in an on the spot fine.

### **Theft from vehicles**

This is common, particularly in the south of France, so keep doors locked, windows rolled up and valuables out of sight while driving and parked. In some tourist areas along the south coast, it is common to remove the parcel shelf so that potential thieves can see that there is nothing worth stealing in the boot.

Mobile homes and camper-vans may also be targeted by thieves so make sure to take appropriate steps such as an alarm or using a safety-deposit box to protect belongings.

### **Safety equipment**

Visitors must carry a red reflective warning triangle and a high-visibility vest in their vehicle at all times from the moment you arrive in France. Visitors must display the warning triangle 30 metres from the vehicle in case of a break-down or accident (except in the case of a break-down on a motorway where it is not safe to walk back 30 metres – in this case, place the triangle a reasonable distance from the vehicle, taking into account safety considerations).

Visitors must carry the high-visibility vest in the main body of your vehicle (not in the boot). The vest must be worn in case of a break-down at any time and must put it on before you get out of your vehicle. Failure to comply may result in a fine.

### **High traffic season**

The traditional French summer holiday periods sees extremely heavy traffic on the weekends of 7 July, 14 July, 4 August, 11 August and 18 August. Allow plenty of extra time and take regular breaks on your journey on these weekends, particularly on routes connecting Paris to the south.

There can be severe traffic jams on the motorways so always make sure the vehicle is refuelled, as it may take longer than you think to reach the next service station.

### **Incident assistance**

Failing to stop and help a third party in difficulty if you witness an incident (on the road or elsewhere) is an offence in France. If you need to stop on the roadside to help someone, high-visibility vest must be worn before leaving your own vehicle.

### **Taxis**

Visitors should only use properly licensed and marked taxis. Beware of people claiming to be taxi drivers who often tout for business at the arrivals areas in airports, train stations or at major bus stations – registered taxi drivers are not allowed to solicit business in this way. Licensed taxis are marked by a white roof sign and the driver's professional identity card is displayed on the left-hand side of the windscreen. A meter will be visible in the centre of the dashboard and there will be a sticker in the left rear window setting out the main rules governing taxis and fares.

### **Truck drivers**

If you are a truck driver, make sure you are familiar with French traffic regulations, particularly details on when you cannot use the motorways.

### **Cyclists**

Paris and many other cities have public bicycle-rental schemes. Cyclist, not allowed to cycle on the footpaths unless a cycle lane is marked as part of the path. Obey all relevant traffic rules and take appropriate safety precautions, particularly if not familiar with cycling on the right-hand side of the road. Avoid cycling if you are under the influence of alcohol.

All cyclists must wear a high-visibility vest when cycling outside urban areas at night.

### **Vehicle hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Train**

Visitors travelling by train should make sure luggage is clearly marked and never leave it unattended. Many left-luggage offices in train stations have been closed for security reasons so try and confirm their availability beforehand or make other arrangements.

Some overnight inter-city trains have been targeted by thieves. On metros and trains, take particular care of your belongings when the doors are closing, as opportunistic thieves on the platform have been known to snatch passengers’ bags just as the train doors close.
