### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. These costs will be covered by an appropriate travel insurance policy bought before departure, provided you have not broken the terms and conditions.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when needed. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure the policy covers all planned activities. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* The entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

As an Irish resident you are entitled to get healthcare through the public system in countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay there. Ensure that you get or renew your EHIC (previously known as E111) before you go.

[**Apply for your EHIC and find out more information**](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/apply/).

The EHIC is not a substitute for proper travel insurance provided by a reputable insurer. It does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. Private hospitals may not accept the EHIC, so check with the hospital administrator beforehand.

### **Aedes Albopictus (Tiger Mosquito)**

The Aedes albopictus, more commonly known as tiger mosquito, is present in south-western and south-eastern regions of France, as well as Alsace, Vendée and the Paris metropolitan area. The aedes albopictus is considered capable of carrying diseases such as dengue, zika, chikunguya or West Nile virus. However, the vast majority of cases of these diseases detected in France were contracted outside of the country, with only a very small number of locally-transmitted cases of dengue, West Nile virus and chikunguya detected in southern France. Travellers are encouraged to consider adopting sensible precautions such as using an insect repellent where mosquitos might be present.
