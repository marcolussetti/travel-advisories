## Safety and security

### **Personal Identification**

Irish citizens in France are reminded that they should be in possession of a valid form of photographic identification such as a passport or passport card at all times.

### **Terrorism**

Following the 22 March attack in Moscow, France has raised its national threat level to the highest, ‘Emergency’ level. This is level 3 on the French Vigipirate security programme. It is established for a limited duration in the event of an imminent threat, or in the immediate aftermath of an attack

When in France, expect to see additional security measures and an increased police presence in public places. This includes a highly visible police and army presence in cities and near main tourist attractions. Many museums, galleries and stadia have security screening programmes in place and visitors may be asked to present bags for inspection before being admitted.  We advise all citizens to maintain an awareness of their surroundings, monitor local media for up-to-date information, and follow the instructions of local authorities. See the French government's advice about [**what to do if a terrorist attack occurs**](https://www.gouvernement.fr/risques/reagir-en-cas-dattaque-terroriste).

### **Minors Travelling Alone**

Minors travelling without a parent must carry specific documentation. Please find [**here**](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1359) information on travel requirements for unaccompanied minors travelling from France, which applies to Irish citizens resident in France.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in France by dialling 112. Irish citizens in France should be in possession of a valid form of photographic identification such as a passport or passport card at all times.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in France but you should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Bring photocopies of your passport when travelling and leave one at your accommodation
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially alone. Check no one has followed you
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in France, report it to the local police station ‘commissariat’ or gendarmerie immediately.
