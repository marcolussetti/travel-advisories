## Safety and security

### **Personal Identification**

Irish citizens in France are reminded that they should be in possession of a valid form of photographic identification such as a passport or passport card at all times.

### **Terrorism**

Following the 22 March attack in Moscow, France has raised its national threat level to the highest, ‘Emergency’ level. This is level 3 on the French Vigipirate security programme. It is established for a limited duration in the event of an imminent threat, or in the immediate aftermath of an attack

When in France, expect to see additional security measures and an increased police presence in public places. This includes a highly visible police and army presence in cities and near main tourist attractions. Many museums, galleries and stadia have security screening programmes in place and visitors may be asked to present bags for inspection before being admitted.  We advise all citizens to maintain an awareness of their surroundings, monitor local media for up-to-date information, and follow the instructions of local authorities. See the French government's advice about [**what to do if a terrorist attack occurs**](https://www.gouvernement.fr/risques/reagir-en-cas-dattaque-terroriste).

### **Minors Travelling Alone**

Minors travelling without a parent must carry specific documentation. Please find [**here**](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1359) information on travel requirements for unaccompanied minors travelling from France, which applies to Irish citizens resident in France.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in France by dialling 112. Irish citizens in France should be in possession of a valid form of photographic identification such as a passport or passport card at all times.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in France but you should take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Bring photocopies of your passport when travelling and leave one at your accommodation
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially alone. Check no one has followed you
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible

See the latest advice and information from the French police on their website [**Staying Safe In Paris**](https://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/).

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in France, report it to the local police station ‘commissariat’ or gendarmerie immediately. Learn more about [**what to do if your passport is lost/stolen**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/lost-stolen-passport/).  Contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Paris**](/en/france/paris/) if you need help.

### **Theft From Vehicles**

This is common, particularly in the south of France, so keep doors locked, windows rolled up and valuables out of sight while driving and parked. In some tourist areas along the south coast, it is common to remove the parcel shelf so that potential thieves can see that there is nothing worth stealing in the boot.

### **Safety Equipment**

Visitors must carry a red reflective warning triangle and a high-visibility vest in their vehicle at all times from the moment you arrive in France. Visitors must display the warning triangle 30 metres from the vehicle in case of a break-down or accident (except in the case of a break-down on a motorway where it is not safe to walk back 30 metres – in this case, place the triangle a reasonable distance from the vehicle, taking into account safety considerations).

Visitors must carry the high-visibility vest in the main body of your vehicle (not in the boot). The vest must be worn in case of a break-down at any time and must put it on before you get out of your vehicle. Failure to comply may result in a fine.

### **High Traffic Season**

The traditional French summer holiday periods sees extremely heavy traffic on the weekends of 7 July, 14 July, 4 August, 11 August and 18 August. Allow plenty of extra time and take regular breaks on your journey on these weekends, particularly on routes connecting Paris to the south.

There can be severe traffic jams on the motorways so always make sure the vehicle is refuelled, as it may take longer than you think to reach the next service station.

These French websites have colour-coded maps and graphics that can be understood by non-French speakers so they may help plan your journey:

### **Incident Assistance**

Failing to stop and help a third party in difficulty if you witness an incident (on the road or elsewhere) is an offence in France. If you need to stop on the roadside to help someone, high-visibility vest must be worn before leaving your own vehicle.

### **Taxis**

Visitors should only use properly licensed and marked taxis. Beware of people claiming to be taxi drivers who often tout for business at the arrivals areas in airports, train stations or at major bus stations – registered taxi drivers are not allowed to solicit business in this way. Licensed taxis are marked by a white roof sign and the driver's professional identity card is displayed on the left-hand side of the windscreen. A meter will be visible in the centre of the dashboard and there will be a sticker in the left rear window setting out the main rules governing taxis and fares.

### **Truck Drivers**

If you are a truck driver, make sure you are familiar with French traffic regulations, particularly details on when you cannot use the motorways.

### **Cyclists**

Paris and many other cities have public bicycle-rental schemes. Cyclist, not allowed to cycle on the footpaths unless a cycle lane is marked as part of the path. Obey all relevant traffic rules and take appropriate safety precautions, particularly if not familiar with cycling on the right-hand side of the road. Avoid cycling if you are under the influence of alcohol.

All cyclists must wear a high-visibility vest when cycling outside urban areas at night.

### **Vehicle Hire**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Train**

Visitors travelling by train should make sure luggage is clearly marked and never leave it unattended. Many left-luggage offices in train stations have been closed for security reasons so try and confirm their availability beforehand or make other arrangements.

Some overnight inter-city trains have been targeted by thieves. On metros and trains, take particular care of your belongings when the doors are closing, as opportunistic thieves on the platform have been known to snatch passengers’ bags just as the train doors close.
