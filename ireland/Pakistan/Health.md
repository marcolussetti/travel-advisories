## Health

### **Health Insurance**

We encourage you to take out private health insurance before traveling to Pakistan. You should make sure that the insurance covers your needs. Travel insurance does not necessarily cover all expenses or in all situations.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Pakistan.

### **Typhoid**

Typhoid vaccination is recommend for all travellers from Ireland to typhoid-endemic countries, including Pakistan. In addition, travellers should be aware of precautions to take to reduce their risk of acquiring typhoid infection including:

* wash hands before eating
* avoid ice and drink only bottled water
* avoid risky foods â€“ undercooked food, raw, unpeeled, unwashed fruit and vegetables or fruit and vegetables washed in unsafe water

### **Polio**

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/polio/).

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Malaria and dengue fever are present in Pakistan so care should be taken to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using mosquito repellents, to reduce the potential of infection.

### **Air Pollution**

Air quality can be particularly poor during winter in large urban centres in Pakistan, in particular in Punjab, which can have short-term and long-term health implications for residents and visitors. We advise citizens to monitor air pollution levels, follow the advice of local authorities and to reduce their exposure to air pollution where possible by staying indoors and avoiding strenuous outdoor activity. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are concerned about the impact of pollution on your health, we advise you to seek medical advice before travelling to these locations.
