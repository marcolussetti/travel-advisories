## Safety and security

India's military has stated that it has attacked several targets in the Punjab and Kashmir regions of Pakistan on the night of May 7, with reports of a Pakistani military response into Indian territory as well. A state of emergency has subsequently been declared in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The security situation is tense and unpredictable.

Avoid staying near the border areas and exercise caution. Stay up to date via the media, local authorities, your hotel, travel agency or airline. Always follow the instructions of the local authorities.

### **Personal ID**

Carry photographic ID at all times.

### **Unrest**

The security situation in Pakistan is unstable and dangerous. Avoid all large gatherings and areas which are known to be vulnerable to unrest.

### **Sectarian violence**

There is an ongoing threat of serious terrorism incidents particularly in Baluchistan and many parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Caution should always be exercised around public gatherings, around major religious festivals and during peak prayer times on Fridays. Public transport (trains / busses) should be completely avoided.

### **Demonstrations**

Avoid political demonstrations and large crowds assembled for political or religious purposes as there is a risk that these gatherings may turn violent. Keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with local contact, hotel or tour organizer. Be aware that mobile data and internet access may be curtailed during periods of civil unrest and major road networks may be blocked. You should make contingency plans accordingly.

### **Terrorism**

There is a high risk of terrorism in Pakistan. In addition to an established pattern of terrorist attacks on military and Government installations, there have been indiscriminate terrorist attacks on public places and these have resulted in large numbers of casualties. Locations frequented by Western nationals - hotels, restaurants, shopping centres and diplomatic Missions – have been targeted.

### **Kidnapping**

The threat of kidnap of foreign nationals across Pakistan remains high. Kidnappers do not discriminate between nationalities or religions so follow these basic precautions:

* Get advice from local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Pakistan are high, especially in Karachi and much of Baluchistan, rural Sindh and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the former FATA (Federally-Administered Tribal Areas), have a high incidence of lawlessness.

### **Violent crime**

Criminal violence, including armed car-jacking, robbery, kidnap and murder, is common in Pakistan, especially in Karachi. Travelers have also been offered drugged food and then robbed. Always be aware of the risks and take personal security precautions.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Pakistan, be extremely careful. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night, road conditions are poor and there is a risk of car-jacking. Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country.
