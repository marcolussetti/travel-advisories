## Safety and security

Following a conflict in May 2025 a ceasefire was announced between Pakistan and India. However, the security situation remains potentially unstable and unpredictable. The Embassy’s travel advice advises against travel to specific parts of the country and in particular to border areas.

There is a high risk of terrorism in Pakistan, including in major cities.

There is an ongoing risk of regular, serious terrorism incidents throughout the provinces of Balochistan and many parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including recent large-scale terrorism incidents. Public transport hubs and areas with large gatherings should be avoided. These incidents can include sectarian violence which can be particularly prominent in Balochistan, parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan. Caution should always be exercised around public gatherings, around major religious festivals and during peak prayer times on Fridays. Public transport (trains / busses) should be completely avoided.

Irish citizens in Pakistan should always exercise vigilance and caution and avoid large public gatherings. While many public demonstrations take place in Pakistan without incident, large gatherings can potentially become violent quickly.

Major political demonstrations can be called at short notice, particularly within Islamabad and other major cities. These protests can turn violent. Protests also frequently involve significant closure of road networks in cities and including airport routes. Major road networks in and around cities and to airports may be blocked. Mobile data coverage and internet connectivity may be cut without warning.

### **Unrest**

The security situation in Pakistan is unstable and dangerous. Avoid all large gatherings and areas which are known to be vulnerable to unrest.

### **Demonstrations**

Avoid political demonstrations and large crowds assembled for political or religious purposes as there is a risk that these gatherings may turn violent. Keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with local contact, hotel or tour organizer. Be aware that mobile data and internet access may be curtailed during periods of civil unrest and major road networks may be blocked. You should make contingency plans accordingly.

### **Terrorism**

There is a high risk of terrorism in Pakistan. In addition to an established pattern of terrorist attacks on military and Government installations, there have been indiscriminate terrorist attacks on public places and these have resulted in large numbers of casualties. Locations frequented by Western nationals - hotels, restaurants, shopping centres and diplomatic Missions – have been targeted.

### **Kidnapping**

The threat of kidnap of foreign nationals across Pakistan remains high. Kidnappers do not discriminate between nationalities or religions so follow these basic precautions:

* Get advice from local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Pakistan are high, especially in Karachi and much of Baluchistan, rural Sindh and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the former FATA (Federally-Administered Tribal Areas), have a high incidence of lawlessness.

Fraud with payment cards and robberies at ATMs are widespread. Do not use an ATM if you see anything suspicious nearby. If you use Wi-Fi from open networks, e.g. at the airport, in cafes or in hotels, you may be exposed to hacking.

Criminal violence, including armed car-jacking, robbery, kidnap and murder, is common in Pakistan, especially in Karachi. Travellers have also been offered drugged food and then robbed. Always be aware of the risks and take personal security precautions.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Pakistan, be extremely careful. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night, road conditions are poor and there is a risk of car-jacking. Take particular care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country.

We recommend that you only ride with authorized taxis or well-known ride-hailing services. If possible, you should book your taxi from a hotel or taxi company. You should not accept offers to ride with strangers.
