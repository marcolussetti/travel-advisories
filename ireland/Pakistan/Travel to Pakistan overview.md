### **Travel Alert**

**Pak-Afghan Border**

Following recent cross-border clashes, travellers are reminded and strongly advised to avoid all non-essential travel to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border regions. These areas remain volatile, with a high risk of terrorism, armed conflict, kidnapping, and cross-border violence.

The security situation can deteriorate rapidly without warning, and government assistance in these regions may be limited or unavailable. Citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates, and strictly adhere to travel advisories issued by relevant authorities.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a valid passport (having minimum validity of 6 months) and a visa to enter Pakistan. It is advisable to take a few photocopies of your passport/valid ID’s during your stay in Pakistan. Please note that Irish Passport Cards are not accepted.

Irish citizens may apply for a visa online through the Pakistani Government’s [**Official Visa Portal**](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/).

Irish travellers with essential travel to Pakistan should [**register their presence**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to ensure that they receive the important travel advice, services, and updates.

A ceasefire between Pakistan and India was declared on May 10 following a period of increased hostilities. However, the security situation remains potentially unstable and unpredictable.

Except for official border crossing points, foreigners are not permitted to travel;

- within 10 miles of Pakistan’s international borders and

- the Kashmir Line of Control,

Pakistan can experience extreme flooding and landslides. The scale of flooding can be large and can sometimes strain the capacity of authorities to deal with these incidents.
