## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Pakistan is an Islamic Republic and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively; men and women should cover their shoulders and legs when in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques or other holy places, and when travelling in more rural areas.

### **Ramadan**

Always be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, do not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal. We advise caution and discretion at all times.

### **Co-habitation**

Co-habitation by an unmarried couple is also illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including prison terms. Drug smuggling can attract the death penalty.

### **Forbidden Products**

It is illegal to import alcohol and pork products.

### **Photography**

We advise not to take photographs at military establishments, airports or any infrastructure, including bridges and dams or from aircraft.
