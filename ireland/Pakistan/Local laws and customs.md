## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Pakistan is an Islamic Republic and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively; men and women should cover their shoulders and legs when in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques or other holy places, and when travelling in more rural areas.

### **Ramadan**

Always be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, do not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is illegal. We advise caution and discretion at all times.

### **Co-habitation**

Co-habitation by an unmarried couple is also illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including prison terms. Drug smuggling can attract the death penalty.

### **Forbidden products**

It is illegal to import alcohol and pork products.

### **Photography**

We advise not to take photographs at military establishments, airports or any infrastructure, including bridges and dams or from aircraft.

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Pakistan.

### **Typhoid**

Typhoid vaccination is recommend for all travellers from Ireland to typhoid-endemic countries, including Pakistan. In addition, travellers should be aware of precautions to take to reduce their risk of acquiring typhoid infection including:

* wash hands before eating
* avoid ice and drink only bottled water
* avoid risky foods â€“ undercooked food, raw, unpeeled, unwashed fruit and vegetables or fruit and vegetables washed in unsafe water

### **Polio**

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/polio/).

### **Mosquito-borne diseases**

Malaria and dengue fever are present in Pakistan so care should be taken to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using mosquito repellents, to reduce the potential of infection.

### **Air pollution**

Air quality can be particularly poor during winter in large urban centres in Pakistan, in particular in Punjab, which can have short-term and long-term health implications for residents and visitors. We advise citizens to monitor air pollution levels, follow the advice of local authorities and to reduce their exposure to air pollution where possible by staying indoors and avoiding strenuous outdoor activity. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are concerned about the impact of pollution on your health, we advise you to seek medical advice before travelling to these locations.
