While airlines are expected to gradually resume activities following the opening of airspace on the 10 May, it may take several days for full operations to resume.

Travellers should contact their airline and monitor airport and authorities’ announcements for up-to-date information.

Avoid staying near the border areas and exercise caution. Stay up to date via the media, local authorities, your hotel, travel agency or airline. Always follow the instructions of the local authorities.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Pakistan. Irish citizens may apply for a visa online through the Pakistani Government’s [**Official Visa Portal**](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/).

A valid passport is required for travel to Pakistan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

There is a high risk of terrorism in Pakistan, including in major cities.

There is an ongoing risk of regular, serious terrorism incidents throughout the provinces of Balochistan and many parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including recent large-scale terrorism incidents. Travel to these areas is totally discouraged. Public transport hubs and areas with large gatherings should be avoided.

Irish citizens in Pakistan should always exercise vigilance and caution and avoid large public gatherings. While many public demonstrations take place in Pakistan without incident, large gatherings can potentially become violent quickly.

Major political demonstrations can be called at short notice, particularly within Islamabad and other major cities. These protests can turn violent. Protests also frequently involve significant closure of road networks in cities and including airport routes. Major road networks in and around cities and to airports may be blocked. Mobile data coverage and internet connectivity may be cut without warning.

Travellers with essential travel to Pakistan should [**register their presence**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, avoid border areas and keep their stay to a minimum.

Except for official border crossing points, foreigners are not permitted to travel within 10 miles of Pakistan’s international borders and the Kashmir Line of Control, or within 30 miles of the Afghan border in Gilgit-Baltistan. The Wagah border crossing to India is currently closed.

Visitors to Pakistan are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

In the event of a natural disaster, transportation, power distribution, access to food and water, telecommunications networks emergency services and medical care may be significantly impacted.
