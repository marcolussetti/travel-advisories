## Local laws and customs

### **Practical Advice**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it’s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Cyprus has a strictly enforced zero tolerance policy towards drugs.

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can lead to life in jail. Carrying even small amounts of an illegal drug can result in jail time.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality is legal in both parts of the Island but discretion in public is advised.

### **Surrogacy in Cyprus**

Irish citizens who are considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus should be aware that surrogacy in Cyprus is highly regulated and is subject to a number of restrictions and conditions. Failure to comply with the requirements of Cypriot law in the context of surrogacy may give rise to criminal liability. It is strongly advised that anyone considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus first obtain independent legal advice on both Irish and Cypriot law.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises citizens not to undertake surrogacy arrangements in the northern part of Cyprus. Intending parents should be aware that there is a high level of risk involved and that there are public concerns about human rights abuses, sexual exploitation and criminal networks in the area, along with inadequate legal protection for all parties.

Although the northern part of Cyprus proclaimed itself the so-called ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ (‘TRNC’) in 1983, it is not recognised by the UN or any country other than Turkey. In line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, Ireland does not recognise the ‘TRNC’. While Cypriot law is considered to apply throughout the island, the northern part of Cyprus is not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.

As a result, any Irish citizen who is considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus should be clear as to where on the island the prospective clinic, hospital, or treatment facility is located. As stated above, the procuring of any health-related services, including surrogacy, in the northern part of Cyprus is strongly advised against due to regulatory and other concerns.

In addition, the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to Irish citizens in the northern part of Cyprus may be heavily constrained. It is also likely that the situation as regards the northern part of Cyprus would lead to complications in the application of the guidelines referred to below.

The Department of Justice has issued guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering (i) whether a child is an Irish citizen, and (ii) who the child's legal parents and guardians are, for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents on behalf of children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements. [**The guidelines can be accessed here**.](/688/CITIZENSHIP-PARENTAGE-GUARDIANSHIP-AND-TRAVEL-DOCUMENT.pdf)This is the only guidance that can be given to people considering international surrogacy.

### **Time Zone**

Cyprus is two hours ahead of Ireland; i.e. when it’s 9.00am in Ireland it’s 11.00am in Cyprus.

### **Electrical Equipment**

Cyprus uses the same electrical infrastructure and plugs as Ireland, so adaptors are not required.

### **Language**

English is widely spoken throughout the island. Road signs in the Republic of Cyprus are normally written in both Greek and English.

### **Mobile Phones**

Irish mobile phones with a roaming facility will operate on the Cypriot network. The international code for Cyprus is +357.

### **Buying Property in Cyprus**

If purchasing a property in the Republic of Cyprus, as with property transactions in general, seek local independent legal advice to ensure that the title deeds are clean and that there are no outstanding mortgages on both the property in question or on the land on which it’s built.

There have been reported cases where, unbeknownst to the purchaser, the land on which a purchased house was built was mortgaged to a bank, and when the landowner defaulted on the loan the bank sought possession of the land.

### **Property in Northern Cyprus**

If considering buying property in the northern part of Cyprus, which is not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, we strongly advise to exercise caution and to get qualified, independent legal advice. This is due to potential claims related to title and ownership from Greek Cypriots displaced from that area in 1974, which may lead to serious financial and legal repercussions.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled in a number of cases that owners of property in northern Cyprus before 1974 continue to be regarded as the legal owners of that property. Potential buyers may face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, decisions of which can be executed elsewhere in the EU, including Ireland.

Furthermore, there is a Cypriot law making it a criminal offence, with penalties of up to seven years imprisonment, to purchase, sell, rent, promote or advertise the sale of property in the northern part of Cyprus owned by Greek Cypriots. Any attempt to undertake such a transaction is also a criminal offence under Republic of Cyprus law.

### **Money**

The currency of Cyprus is the Euro. Cyprus takes seriously the possession of fake euro banknotes and checks are made at the majority of retail outlets. If you’re found to be in possession of fake Euro banknotes, the police will be called and you may be prosecuted.

All major credit cards are accepted in Cyprus and bank cards from Irish banks can be used in shops and at ATMs.
