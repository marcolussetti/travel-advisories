## Local laws and customs

### **Practical advice**

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and itâ€™s your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Cyprus has a strictly enforced zero tolerance policy towards drugs.

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can lead to life in jail. Carrying even small amounts of an illegal drug can result in jail time.

### **Homosexuality**

Homosexuality is legal in both parts of the Island but discretion in public is advised.
