## Natural disasters and climate

### **Weather**

Cyprus has an intense Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot and dry from mid-May to mid-September. From November to mid-March winters are rainy and changeable and are separated only by short autumn and spring seasons.

### **Sun Safety**

Citizens are advised to be sun-safe and take the necessary steps to avoid over-exposure to the sun.

Remember to **slip, slap, slop** and **wrap**:  
• **Slip** on a loose long sleeved t-shirt  
• **Slap** on a wide-brimmed hat that covers the back of the neck as well  
• **Slop** on sunscreen generously and regularly (SPF 15 or higher and at least SPF 30 for children)  
• **Wrap** on sunglasses

Particular attention should be taken to protect children and babies from sun exposure.
