## Entry requirements

The northern part of Cyprus proclaimed itself the ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ (‘TRNC’) in 1983. The ‘TRNC’ is not recognised internationally, by the UN or any country other than Turkey. In line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, Ireland does not recognise the ‘TRNC’.

Due to the political situation in the north of Cyprus the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to Irish citizens in the north of Cyprus may be restricted.

### **Visa/Passport**

A valid passport is required to visit Cyprus. However, Irish passport holders do not require an entry visa into the Republic of Cyprus. Irish passports must be valid for the full duration of your stay.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay, carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and should never give your passport as security for car, motorbike or quad bike rentals.

### **Entry to Northern Cyprus**

There are checkpoints between the south and north of Cyprus. Irish citizens must show their passport to officials when entering and leaving the north.

Foreign nationals who have entered Cyprus through the north (such as via Ercan airport) are considered by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus to have entered Cyprus through an illegal port of entry. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus reserves the right to fine EU (including Irish) citizens for illegal entry if they cross into the south.
