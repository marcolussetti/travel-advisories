## Safety and security

### **U.N. Buffer Zone:**

A UN peacekeeping force administers a buffer zone between the north and the south of Cyprus. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus controls the southern part of the island.

Irish citizens are advised not to attempt to enter the United Nations buffer zone at any place other than a designated crossing point.

It is illegal in both parts of Cyprus (north and south of the UN Buffer Zone) to:

* take photos of military camps, facilities, personnel or equipment, or anything that could be perceived as being of a security interest, even by accident;  
  • take photos in the UN buffer zone;  
  • take photos in any designated military area.

Pay particular attention to areas marked with “no photography” signs. Police on both sides of the island strictly enforce these restrictions.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Cyprus is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Cyprus but take sensible precautions:

* Watch out for bag-snatching and pickpocketing, particularly in tourist areas.  
  • Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.  
  • Leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.  
  • Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are infrequent but they do occur. Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they are not spiked. If drinking, know your limit; drinks served in bars are often stronger than those in Ireland.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Cyprus, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Nicosia if you need help.

Always request a police report when you report a crime.

### **Arrest Notification**

If arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Irish Embassy immediately.

### **Public Transportation**

There are few public buses and no rail links in Cyprus. Taxis are widely available.

### **Vehicle hire**

Rental cars and scooters are widely available and carry distinguishable red number plates. If hiring any vehicle, whether it is a car, moped, boat or jet ski, check that it is road, or sea-worthy and that you have appropriate insurance cover and safety equipment. Also read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).  
• If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.  
• If intending to take a hire car to the north of the island you will need to cross at a designated checkpoint. Car insurance purchased in the southern part of the island is not valid in the north. If traveling north of the UN buffer zone, separate car insurance is required, which can be purchased at some crossing points.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Cyprus, remember to drive on the left, as in Ireland. The standard of driving in Cyprus is not the same as in Ireland and extra caution is required. Drivers are advised to watch out for cars changing lanes without using their indicators.

If you want to drive:

Bring a full Irish driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.  
• Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, heavily fined or banned from driving if caught.  
• Be aware of Cyprus’s traffic laws, such as speed limits. On motorways, the limit is 100km/hour.  
• Visitors can be heavily fined if driving without wearing a seat belt or while using a mobile phone, or if riding a motorbike without wearing a crash helmet.  
• Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.  
• Be vigilant at traffic-light junctions as there is a tendency to jump red lights.

### **Swimming**

Bathing is generally safe, but be aware of strong seas and undertows, particularly on the west coast. Always comply with warning signs and swim only from approved beaches.
