## Additional information

The northern part of Cyprus proclaimed itself the ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ (‘TRNC’) in 1983. The ‘TRNC’ is not recognised internationally, by the UN or any country other than Turkey. In line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, Ireland does not recognise the ‘TRNC’.

Due to the political situation in the north of Cyprus the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to Irish citizens in the north of Cyprus may be restricted.

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

A valid passport is required to visit Cyprus. However, Irish passport holders do not require an entry visa into the Republic of Cyprus. Irish passports must be valid for the full duration of your stay.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you. During your stay, carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and should never give your passport as security for car, motorbike or quad bike rentals.

### **Entry to northern Cyprus**

There are checkpoints between the south and north of Cyprus. Irish citizens must show their passport to officials when entering and leaving the north.

Foreign nationals who have entered Cyprus through the north (such as via Ercan airport) are considered by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus to have entered Cyprus through an illegal port of entry. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus reserves the right to fine EU (including Irish) citizens for illegal entry if they cross into the south.

### **Time Zone**

Cyprus is two hours ahead of Ireland; i.e. when it’s 9.00am in Ireland it’s 11.00am in Cyprus.

### **Electrical equipment**

Cyprus uses the same electrical infrastructure and plugs as Ireland, so adaptors are not required.

### **Language**

English is widely spoken throughout the island. Road signs in the Republic of Cyprus are normally written in both Greek and English.

### **Mobile phones**

Irish mobile phones with a roaming facility will operate on the Cypriot network. The international code for Cyprus is +357.

### **Buying property in Cyprus**

If purchasing a property in the Republic of Cyprus, as with property transactions in general, seek local independent legal advice to ensure that the title deeds are clean and that there are no outstanding mortgages on both the property in question or on the land on which it’s built.

There have been reported cases where, unbeknownst to the purchaser, the land on which a purchased house was built was mortgaged to a bank, and when the landowner defaulted on the loan the bank sought possession of the land.

### **Property in northern Cyprus**

If considering buying property in the northern part of Cyprus, which is not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, we strongly advise to exercise caution and to get qualified, independent legal advice. This is due to potential claims related to title and ownership from Greek Cypriots displaced from that area in 1974, which may lead to serious financial and legal repercussions.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled in a number of cases that owners of property in northern Cyprus before 1974 continue to be regarded as the legal owners of that property. Potential buyers may face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, decisions of which can be executed elsewhere in the EU, including Ireland.

Furthermore, there is a Cypriot law making it a criminal offence, with penalties of up to seven years imprisonment, to purchase, sell, rent, promote or advertise the sale of property in the northern part of Cyprus owned by Greek Cypriots. Any attempt to undertake such a transaction is also a criminal offence under Republic of Cyprus law.

### **Money**

The currency of Cyprus is the Euro. Cyprus takes seriously the possession of fake euro banknotes and checks are made at the majority of retail outlets. If you’re found to be in possession of fake Euro banknotes, the police will be called and you may be prosecuted.

All major credit cards are accepted in Cyprus and bank cards from Irish banks can be used in shops and at ATMs.
