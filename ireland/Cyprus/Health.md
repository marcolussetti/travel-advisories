### **Surrogacy in Cyprus**

Irish citizens who are considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus should be aware that surrogacy in Cyprus is highly regulated and is subject to a number of restrictions and conditions. Failure to comply with the requirements of Cypriot law in the context of surrogacy may give rise to criminal liability. It is strongly advised that anyone considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus first obtain independent legal advice on both Irish and Cypriot law.

The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises citizens not to undertake surrogacy arrangements in the northern part of Cyprus. Intending parents should be aware that there is a high level of risk involved and that there are public concerns about human rights abuses, sexual exploitation and criminal networks in the area, along with inadequate legal protection for all parties.

Although the northern part of Cyprus proclaimed itself the so-called ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ (‘TRNC’) in 1983, it is not recognised by the UN or any country other than Turkey. In line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, Ireland does not recognise the ‘TRNC’. While Cypriot law is considered to apply throughout the island, the northern part of Cyprus is not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.

As a result, any Irish citizen who is considering entering into a surrogacy arrangement in Cyprus should be clear as to where on the island the prospective clinic, hospital, or treatment facility is located. As stated above, the procuring of any health-related services, including surrogacy, in the northern part of Cyprus is strongly advised against due to regulatory and other concerns.

In addition, the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to Irish citizens in the northern part of Cyprus may be heavily constrained. It is also likely that the situation as regards the northern part of Cyprus would lead to complications in the application of the guidelines referred to below.

The Department of Justice has issued guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering (i) whether a child is an Irish citizen, and (ii) who the child's legal parents and guardians are, for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents on behalf of children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements. [**The guidelines can be accessed here**.](/688/CITIZENSHIP-PARENTAGE-GUARDIANSHIP-AND-TRAVEL-DOCUMENT.pdf)This is the only guidance that can be given to people considering international surrogacy.

### **COVID-19**

There are still measures in place in Cyprus if a tourist should test positive for COVID-19.

Further information can be found here: [**Covid19 Travel Protocol (visitcyprus.com)**](https://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/news/774-covid19-travel-protocol).

### **Weather**

Cyprus has an intense Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot and dry from mid-May to mid-September. From November to mid-March winters are rainy and changeable and are separated only by short autumn and spring seasons.

### **Sun safety**

Citizens are advised to be sun-safe and take the necessary steps to avoid over-exposure to the sun.

Remember to **slip, slap, slop** and **wrap**:  
• **Slip** on a loose long sleeved t-shirt  
• **Slap** on a wide-brimmed hat that covers the back of the neck as well  
• **Slop** on sunscreen generously and regularly (SPF 15 or higher and at least SPF 30 for children)  
• **Wrap** on sunglasses

Particular attention should be taken to protect children and babies from sun exposure.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Cyprus.

### **Emergency assistance**

If emergency medical assistance is required during your stay in Cyprus, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If referred to a medical facility for treatment, contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.

There are several private hospitals and clinics in Cyprus that operate private ambulances. We recommend always check with the ambulance drivers if they are taking you to a private or state hospital to prevent any potential queries over hospital charges. Your EHIC card will not cover private hospitals or clinics.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

We advise you to get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before travel to Cyprus. This card replaces the E111 form and entitles you to emergency medical treatment on the same terms as Cypriot nationals.

The EHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance and does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. You can apply for an EHIC online at [**www.ehic.ie**](http://www.ehic.ie/)

The EHIC is not valid in north Cyprus.

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. Buying an appropriate travel insurance policy will ensure these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities planned during trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

**If planning to visit the northern part of the island**, make sure that your insurance covers travel there.

The Embassy strongly advises against procuring any health-related services in northern Cyprus due to the lack of regulation and the fact that its legal system operates in the context of international non-recognition of the ‘TRNC’.
