## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required for Cyprus.

### **Medical Assistance**

If emergency medical assistance is required during your stay in Cyprus, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If referred to a medical facility for treatment, contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.

There are several private hospitals and clinics in Cyprus that operate private ambulances. We recommend always check with the ambulance drivers if they are taking you to a private or state hospital to prevent any potential queries over hospital charges. Your EHIC card will not cover private hospitals or clinics.

### **European Health Insurance Card**

We advise you to get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before travel to Cyprus. This card replaces the E111 form and entitles you to emergency medical treatment on the same terms as Cypriot nationals.

The EHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance and does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment or treatment of a non-urgent nature. You can apply for an EHIC online at [**www.ehic.ie**](http://www.ehic.ie/)

The EHIC is not valid in north Cyprus.

### **Travel Insurance**

We cannot pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while abroad. Buying an appropriate travel insurance policy will ensure these costs will be covered, provided the terms and conditions have not been broken.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities planned during trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency Expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. water sport activities such as jet skiing or other extreme sports).

Exclusions: Most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.

**If planning to visit the northern part of the island**, make sure that your insurance covers travel there.

The Embassy strongly advises against procuring any health-related services in northern Cyprus due to the lack of regulation and the fact that its legal system operates in the context of international non-recognition of the ‘TRNC’.
