## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is a traveller's responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Although Lebanon may seem less conservative than its neighbours in the region, we recommend you dress modestly when visiting sites of religious significance, and areas outside the main cities.

### **Ramadan**

During the holy month of Ramadan, avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public in certain areas as this may cause offence.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Local Laws**

While you’re in Lebanon, you’re subject to local laws, including ones that may seem harsh by Irish standards. For example, the laws around custody of children are significantly different to those in force in Ireland. If you are a parent be aware of your legal position.

If you have to deal with any legal matters in Lebanon, particularly about family law, we strongly advise you to get professional legal advice.

### **Photography**

It’s against the law to photograph or video government buildings or military personnel, equipment and installations.
