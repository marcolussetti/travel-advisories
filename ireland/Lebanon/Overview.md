### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Lebanon at this time.**

**The Department strongly advises** **all Irish citizens currently in Lebanon to leave now while commercial options remain available.**

**As we do not have an Irish Embassy in Beirut, we advise Irish citizens in Lebanon who have not already done so** [**to register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) **with the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo.**

The situation in Lebanon remains highly volatile with intensifying clashes along the southern border in recent weeks. **In light of the unpredictability of the situation, events could escalate throughout the country with very little warning.** **This could affect exit routes out of Lebanon.**

Citizens should be aware that, in the event that the political or security situation deteriorates, The Embassy is likely to be very limited in the assistance that can be provided. **Citizens should not rely on evacuation options being possible if commercial options become unavailable**.

**If for any reason travellers cannot leave Lebanon now, the Embassy advises travellers to** **exercise extreme caution in all movements and put** **contingency plans in place to leave Lebanon as soon as possible.**

Citizens should also ensure their documentation, including passports, is up-to-date.

**If you are an Irish citizen with a family member who requires a visa for travel to Ireland, an application for a visa to enter Ireland should be made**[**online here**](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) **without delay.** Once submitted, an appointment should be made with Ireland’s Honorary Consulate: Tel: + 961 139 5005/ [**email here**](mailto:karen.mokdad@honoraryconsul.ie)

Citizens should avoid all gatherings and demonstrations, remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Lebanon at this time.**

The security situation in Lebanon remains unstable and could deteriorate without warning. Military activity in Southern Lebanon including airstrikes and missile and rocket fire has escalated in recent weeks. This could spread to other areas in Lebanon with little warning.

Due to the events in Israel and Palestine, as well as economic and political crises, there is an increased risk of protests and demonstrations, including outside international organisations and Embassies, which can quickly lead to violence.

Citizens already in Lebanon should avoid the immediate area of any protests or demonstrations, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.

The Department advises against all travel to the area south of the Litani River, which includes the main Naqoura-Tyre-Saida-Beirut highway and areas to the west of it.

The Department also advises against all travel to the [**12 Palestinian refugee camps**](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon). The Department advises against all travel within 15km of the border with Syria.

The Lebanese Lira has lost 90% of its real value and restrictions have been placed on financial transactions and ATM withdrawals. Lebanon is also experiencing electricity and fuel shortages, leading to power outages. Pharmacies and hospitals report shortages of medicines and medical equipment. Since October 2022, there have been reported cases of cholera across the country. Please see the Additional Information tab for more on Health issues in Lebanon.

Buildings and infrastructure were severely damaged in the Beirut port explosion on 4 August 2020. This remains an ongoing concern and could pose a risk to your personal safety.

Citizens in Lebanon are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Cairo on  Twitter [**@IRLEmbCairo**](https://twitter.com/IRLEmbCairo) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Citizens can contact the emergency services in Lebanon by dialling 125. Specific emergency numbers are:

* Police: 112
* Fire brigade: 175
* Ambulance: 140
