The situation in Lebanon remains volatile. **In light of the unpredictability of the situation, events could escalate throughout the country with little warning.**

Irish citizens in Lebanon should [register](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo. [KJTAE1] Citizens should be aware that, in the event that the political or security situation deteriorates, we do not have an Embassy in Beirut and the Embassy is likely to be very limited in the assistance that can be provided.

Citizens should avoid all gatherings and demonstrations, remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Citizens in need of assistance, can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Cairo, Egypt**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/egypt/cairo/)**.** If you are an Irish citizen and in need of emergency assistance outside of normal office hours, then you can contact us on the following emergency number: +20 1274443942.

### **General Travel Advice**

The security situation in Lebanon remains unstable and could deteriorate without warning. Military activity continues in various parts of the country, particularly in Southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. This includes airstrikes and artillery fire. Military activity could spread to other areas in Lebanon with little warning.

Due to regional events, as well as economic and political crises, there is an increased risk of protests and demonstrations, including outside international organisations and Embassies, which could quickly lead to violence.

Citizens already in Lebanon should avoid the immediate area of any protests or demonstrations, remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.

The Lebanese Lira has lost 90% of its real value and restrictions have been placed on financial transactions and ATM withdrawals. Lebanon is also experiencing electricity and fuel shortages, leading to power outages. Pharmacies and hospitals report shortages of medicines and medical equipment. Since October 2022, there have been reported cases of cholera across the country. Please see the Additional Information tab for more on Health issues in Lebanon.

Buildings and infrastructure were severely damaged in the Beirut port explosion on 4 August 2020. This remains an ongoing concern and could pose a risk to your personal safety.

Citizens in Lebanon are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Cairo on X [**@IRLEmbCairo**](https://twitter.com/IRLEmbCairo) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**
