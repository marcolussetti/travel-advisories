## Safety and security

### **Political unrest and Regional tensions**

The political situation in Lebanon is fragile and has the potential to deteriorate quickly.

Political tensions and security concerns are heightened at present as a result of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the long standing security and political situation in Syria. Wider regional tensions are reflected inside Lebanon, with clashes between the many sectarian groups potentially erupting without warning. Clashes have also occurred between Lebanese citizens and refugees from Syria. It is also possible that military action by neighbouring states could impact civilians in certain neighbourhoods of urban areas.

If in Lebanon, we advise travellers to exercise extreme caution and to consider your need to remain there. Monitor this travel advice, DFA social media and local media for updates.

### **Terrorism**

There have been a number of attacks by al Qaeda-linked militants, mainly in the northern city of Tripoli and close to the Syrian border. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and Lebanese Government interests, particularly the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), have been targeted for attacks by some of the militant groups, some of these resulting in fatalities.

### **Landmines**

Unexploded ordnance, particularly in the South, and in the Bekaa Valley, is a risk. Don’t stray off main routes, particularly in rural areas, and always check with a local contact before travelling to affected regions.

### **Kidnapping**

Foreign nationals can be potential targets for kidnapping throughout Lebanon, particularly in the northern city of Tripoli and Baalbek or other parts of the Bekaa Valley, where we strongly advise travellers to keep to the main roads and larger towns.

### **Protests and Demonstrations**

Protest and demonstrations can turn violent with little warning. The Embassy strongly advise all Irish citizens in Lebanon to avoid all protests and demonstrations. If caught up in a demonstration Irish citizens should not attempt to take photos and should leave the area immediately. Monitor local media for updates.

### **Crime**

The risk to tourists from petty or violent crime is low in Lebanon. Citizens should always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry a credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry a passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Lebanon, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the [**Honorary Consul in Beirut**](/en/dfa/embassies/) or the [**Irish Embassy in Cairo**](/en/egypt/cairo/) if you require assistance.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Lebanon, travellers should be extremely careful as the accident rate is high and road standards are variable. If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and an international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance. International driving permits must be certified by authorities on arrival
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and all bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights
* Avoid driving outside the main cities at night
* Be aware that many traffic lights are not in operation due to electricity shortages.

### **Road closures**

The road to the airport can be closed sporadically due to various factors, including local sectarian clashes, civil unrest in Syria and protests against government policies.

### **Diesel engines**

If driving your own car in Lebanon, be aware that vehicles with diesel engines are now banned.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
