## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations for Tajikistan are required.

### **Medical facilities**

Tajikistan is a very poor country, with poor medical facilities and a shortage of basic medical supplies. Brand name drugs may not be genuine. Medical and rescue facilities are unreliable where they exist at all. Tourist facilities are very underdeveloped, and goods and services taken for granted in Ireland may not be available. Visitors should also take particular care over food and drink preparation.

### **Diseases**

Tuberculosis is widespread in Tajikistan. An outbreak of polio has been reported and there is a threat of typhoid, cholera and other diseases, including malaria, in summer in the Khatlon region and in the south of Gorno-Badakhshan.

### **Water**

We recommend drinking only boiled or bottled water and avoiding ice in drinks during your stay.
