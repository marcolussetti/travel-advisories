## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors must carry a form of photographic identification at all times and a copy of your Tajik visa, as there are frequent document checks by the local authorities. We advise carrying a photocopy of the relevant page of your passport and keeping the original in a safe place.

### **Dual Nationality**

The Republic of Tajikistan does not recognise dual nationality and visitors are expected to have only one passport.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Lengthy prison sentences are imposed on those found guilty of drug possession and/or drug use.

### **Smoking**

It is illegal to smoke in many public establishments.

### **Photography**

Avoid taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest as this could result in problems with the authorities.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is not illegal under Tajik law but is still very much frowned upon socially. Be discreet and avoid public displays of affection.

### **Money**

Tajikistan is a cash-only economy. Visitors should only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. Very few establishments accept credit cards and none accept travellersâ€™ cheques. There are only a handful of ATM machines, and none in rural areas. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency; others may be difficult to exchange.

### **Currency**

Visitors must fill in a Customs Declaration Form when arriving in Tajikistan, have it stamped by Tajik officials at the port of entry and keep it until your departure to show that you are not leaving Tajikistan with more money than you arrived with.

### **Electricity**

Please note that electricity is sometimes rationed, especially during the colder months.
