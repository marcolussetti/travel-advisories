## Entry requirements

### Visa

Irish citizens may enter Tajikistan without a visa for up to 30 days. For more information, please contact the [**Embassy of Tajikistan in London**](https://mfa.tj/en/london).

Always check your visa and visa registration validity dates so that these documents can be renewed in good time if necessary. Always carry a copy of your Tajik visa, as there are frequent document checks by the local authorities.

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required for travel to Tajikistan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport and to also carry a photocopy as you must have a form of photographic identification to hand at all times.
