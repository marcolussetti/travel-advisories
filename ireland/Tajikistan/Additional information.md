## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens may enter Tajikistan without a visa for up to 30 days. For more information, please contact the [**Embassy of Tajikistan in London**](https://mfa.tj/en/london).

A valid passport is required for travel to Tajikistan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

### **Visas**

Always check your visa and visa registration validity dates so that these documents can be renewed in good time if necessary. Always carry a copy of your Tajik visa, as there are frequent document checks by the local authorities.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport and to also carry a photocopy as you must have a form of photographic identification to hand at all times.

### **Money**

Tajikistan is a cash-only economy. Visitors should only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. Very few establishments accept credit cards and none accept travellersâ€™ cheques. There are only a handful of ATM machines, and none in rural areas. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency; others may be difficult to exchange.

### **Currency**

Visitors must fill in a Customs Declaration Form when arriving in Tajikistan, have it stamped by Tajik officials at the port of entry and keep it until your departure to show that you are not leaving Tajikistan with more money than you arrived with.

### **Electricity**

Please note that electricity is sometimes rationed, especially during the colder months.
