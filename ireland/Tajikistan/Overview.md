### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens may enter Tajikistan without a visa for up to 30 days. For more information, please contact the [**Embassy of Tajikistan in London**](https://mfa.tj/en/london).

A valid passport is required for travel to Tajikistan. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Conflict can occur along the disputed Tajik-Kyrgyz border. Previous incidents have involved both civilians and border guards and several have involved firearms.

We advise against all travel to the Gorno-Badakhshan region, including the city of Khorog, and the Kamarob Gorge in the Rasht region.

Visitors to Tajikistan are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens are highly encouraged to [**register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their travel with the Irish Embassy in Moscow, which is operating with reduced staffing at the current time.

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.
