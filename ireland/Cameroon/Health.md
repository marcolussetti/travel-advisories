### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Yellow fever vaccination certificate must be presented upon arrival in Cameroon.

Cholera vaccination certificate is required when arriving from the affected areas.

The government of the Republic of Cameroon currently recommends that all travellers to Cameroon be vaccinated against poliomyelitis.

Polio vaccination is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/VaccinePreventable/Polio/Guidance/).

Check with a doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of travelling to see if any other vaccinations for Cameroon are needed.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case your medication is lost.
