## Travel to Cameroon overview

### **Security Status**

Avoid Non-Essential Travel

### **Travel Alert**

Irish citizens are advised to follow developments in the region in respect of m-pox, and to consult advice available such as on the [**HSE website**](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mpox/).

We advise against non-essential travel to the north, the east and the west of the country. The security situation in these areas is extremely dangerous, and we may only be able to provide very limited assistance if difficulties are encountered.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish Citizens require visa to enter Cameroon.

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months and have at least one blank page.

Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry Requirements tab.

Visitors are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Nigeria on social media ([**X**](https://x.com/IrlEmbNigeria)and [**Facebook)**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandnigeria/) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

As there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Cameroon, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if assistance is needed, citizens can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Abuja in Nigeria**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/) or our Consular Assistance Unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.
