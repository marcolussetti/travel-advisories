## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Cameroon. Further information on how to apply for a visa can be found from the [**High Commission for the Republic of Cameroon in London**](https://cameroonhighcommission.co.uk/).

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from date of entry and have at least one blank page. It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Cameroon and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, contact the [**Irish Embassy in Nigeria**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/nigeria/abuja/) . We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document to get home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is needed to make a claim on travel insurance. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.
