## Entry requirements

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Eswatini and to carry a photocopy at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad contact the Irish Embassy in Maputo. We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document to get home;
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

A police report is needed to make a claim on travel insurance. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.
