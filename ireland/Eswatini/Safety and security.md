## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

Public protest, demonstrations and strikes can occur occasionally in Eswatini. The last significant protests broke out in 2021 and resulted in significant damage and loss of life, while a series of security-related incidents continued in 2022. As of 2025, the security situation has improved significantly, but travellers should remain vigilant for any signs of disturbances, and avoid protests, demonstrations or marches.

Irish citizens should monitor local and social media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities and the EU Delegation in Eswatini.
