## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens need a visa to enter Guinea. You can apply for visas for both private and business travel and residency at the Embassy of the Republic of Guinea in London and on the [**Guinea Online Visa Portal**](https://www.paf.gov.gn/visa).

If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the [**local immigration authorities**](http://www.paf.gov.gn/) or your nearest Guinean Embassy.

### Passport

Passports should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your application for a visa to enter Guinea and must be valid for at least the duration of your stay in Guinea.

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Guinea and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad you should contact the [**Irish Embassy in Sierra Leone**](/en/sierraleone/freetown/) . We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you.

What we can do:

* Issue an emergency travel document that will get you home,
* If required, provide advice on applying for new passport.

You will need a police report if you want to make a claim on your travel insurance. We will not provide you with a travel document without a police report.
