## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Guinea, we are limited in our ability to provide up-to-date information on local laws and customs in Guinea. We advise Irish citizens to seek advice on this from their employer, tour operator or other local contacts.
