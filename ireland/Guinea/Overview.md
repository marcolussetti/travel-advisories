### **Latest Travel Alert**

The availability and quality of medical services in Guinea is poor. Citizens should be aware that they may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas.

Following a coup in Guinea on 5 September 2021, a transitional government is in place. Political tensions are high. Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country  with little or no notice and may turn violent. You should avoid large demonstrations or rallies (both political and non-political), particularly those close to military barracks and regularly monitor local and international media reports.

It is strongly recommended that Irish citizens travelling to or in Guinea [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with our Embassy in Sierra Leone.
