## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

Following a coup in Guinea on 5 September 2021, a transitional government is in place. Political tensions are high. Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, may be  called with little or no notice and can quickly turn violent. You should avoid large demonstrations or rallies (both political and non-political), particularly those close to military barracks and regularly monitor local and international media reports.

It is strongly recommended that Irish citizens travelling in Guinea [**register**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with our Embassy in Sierra Leone.

### **Crime**

For assistance or to report a crime, the local police number for downtown Conakry is +224 622 039 258.

Motorists have encountered theft at gun point, particularly at night. These crimes are often carried out by individuals dressed in police or military uniforms and carrying military weapons. There have been incidents of violent car-jackings, especially in the outlying suburbs of Conakry. Burglaries and break-ins are common.

There are regular reports of robberies on the roads to Mamou, Faranah, Kissidougou, Guékédou, Macenta, N’zérékoré.

### **Terrorism**

There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which can target areas frequented by foreign tourists.

### **Transport**

The roads in Guinea are hazardous, particularly during the rainy season from May to October. If you are planning to drive, you should plan your route before any journey, particularly outside of Conakry, and you should avoid travelling outside of cities at night. Carry your Irish driving licence and International Driving Permit at all times.

Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained, and the drivers often unqualified. Few motorists have any form of insurance. Most major hotels and travel agencies offer cars for hire, with a chauffeur if required.

The standard of road maintenance is low. Beware of deep potholes. Many roads are not metalled and are not repaired after the rainy season. Roads within Conakry and other principal towns can quickly become flooded and impassable.

### **Emergency Assistance**

If there is an emergency, or if you need help and advice, you can contact our Consular Assistance Unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin on +353 1 408 2000.

As there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Guinea, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Under the EU Consular Protection Directive, Irish nationals may seek assistance from the Embassy or Consulate of any other EU member state in a country where there is no Irish Embassy or permanent representation.
