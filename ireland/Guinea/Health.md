## Health

### **Medical Services**

The availability and quality of medical services in Guinea is poor. Citizens should be aware that you may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas.

Carrying basic medical supplies and a first aid kit, particularly when travelling outside of Conakry, is recommended.

### **Pre-existing Medical Condition**

If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment during your stay.

### **Medication**

If you choose to travel, bring enough medication with you for the duration of your visit and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **Tropical Illnesses**

Tropical illnesses are extremely common in Guinea. If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Guinea, or in the weeks following your departure from Guinea, you should telephone your GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history; you may require immediate investigation and treatment.

We advise Irish citizens working in medical facilities or caring for sick people in Guinea to take particular care and seek expert advice on infection prevention.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot provide advice on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) is a requirement for entry to some countries. A yellow fever vaccine certificate is typically required for entry into countries in West Africa.
