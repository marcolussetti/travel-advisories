## Health

The availability and quality of medical services in Guinea is poor. Citizens should be aware that you may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas.

If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment during your stay.

If you choose to travel, bring enough medication with you for the duration of your visit and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

Tropical illnesses are extremely common in Guinea. If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Guinea, or in the weeks following your departure from Guinea, you should telephone your GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history; you may require immediate investigation and treatment.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot provide advice on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) is a requirement for entry to some countries. A yellow fever vaccine certificate is typically required for entry into countries in West Africa.

### **Ebola, Lassa Fever and the Marburg Virus**

Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg viras are acute viral haemorrhagic fever illnesses transmitted to humans via contact with contaminated food or household items; or through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

In February 2021, there was confirmation of anoutbreak of Ebola in Guinea close to the border with Sierra Leone. Following increased surveillance and preventative measures, this outbreak was declared over in June 2021.  More information about Ebola is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease).

Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa.  Between January and March 2022, a total of 20 cases of Lassa fever were reported, which resulted in 11 deaths.  If you are concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, you should seek immediate medical advice.    Further information on Lassa fever is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever).

Guinea recorded an outbreak of the Marburg virus in August 2021, however this was declared over in September 2021. You can find more information on Marburg virus from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease).

We advise Irish citizens working in medical facilities or caring for sick people in Guinea to take particular care and seek expert advice on infection prevention.

If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Guinea, or in the weeks following your departure, you should telephone your GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history; you may require immediate investigation and treatment.
