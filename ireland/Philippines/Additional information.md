## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

### **Visas**

Under normal circumstances, Irish passport holders can enter the Philippines without a visa for an initial period of 30 days. Entry to the Philippines may be refused if you are unable to produce evidence of return or onward travel - for example an onward or return air ticket. Visitors can apply to extend your stay at the offices of the Bureau of Immigration Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and can lead to detention pending payment of outstanding fees and fines and voluntary deportation at your own expense.

If you’re unsure of the entry requirements for the Philippines, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of the Philippines.

### **Passport**

Visitors should make sure their passports are valid for a minimum of six months after the conclusion of their trip to the Philippines (or other countries within South East Asia).

During their stay visitors should carry a photocopy of their passport and your arrival card at all times so it can be shown as evidence of your identity if asked, for example, by the police.
