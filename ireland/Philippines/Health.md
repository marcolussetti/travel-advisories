## Health

### **Medical Facilities**

The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines, and may not meet the standards of care in the Europe. Although adequate in major cities, medical care is limited in more remote areas. Treatment can be very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

If visitors need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 117 and ask for an ambulance. Visitors should contact their insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Water-borne Diseases**

Water-borne diseases, including typhoid and cholera, are endemic in the Philippines. Visitors should use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

### **Rabies**

There is a risk of rabies throughout the Philippines.
