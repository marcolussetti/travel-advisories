## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy or Consulate in Réunion, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Paris**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/france/paris/contact/)**.**

If urgent assistance is you required while the Embassy is closed, please contact the main Embassy number, +331 44 17 67 00, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox. This mailbox will be monitored regularly.
