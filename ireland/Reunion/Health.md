### **Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor a minimum of eight weeks in advance of departure to see if you need any vaccinations for travel to RÃ©union.
