## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Tourists do not need a visa for visits of up to 31 days. You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you’re travelling to and proof of accommodation during your stay in the Cook Islands. If you’re staying longer than 31 days in The Cook Islands you may need a visa or entry on arrival permit.

Extensions may be granted on a monthly basis for up to 5 months. For extensions, you will need to apply at least 2 weeks before your permit expires.

If you plan to join a tourist boat, yacht or other sea-going vessel to travel beyond the Cook Islands, you must apply for permission to enter via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration (MFAI).

If you are visiting the Cook Islands via New Zealand, in most cases transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for via the official mobile app or on the [**New Zealand Immigration website**](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta.).
