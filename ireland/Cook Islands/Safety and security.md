## Safety and security

### **Petty Crime**

Crime in the Cook Islands is low but petty crime can occur.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to the Cook Islands:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Demonstrations**

Public gatherings and demonstrations may take place from time to time.

We recommend that you stay clear of demonstrations, and should follow the advice of the local authorities.

### **Road Travel**

Driving is on the left. You should avoid driving at night out of built-up areas. Vehicle safety regulations are not consistently enforced. Beware of pedestrians and animals on the roads.

### **Swimming**

Swimming, snorkelling and diving are common activities. Take local advice before swimming as fatal accidents can occur at popular beaches.
