## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **LGBTQI+ Travel**

Consensual same-sex sexual activity is no longer illegal following a change to the law, effective 1 June 2023. Despite this, public displays of affection may be considered offensive.
