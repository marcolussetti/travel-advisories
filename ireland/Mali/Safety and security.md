## Safety and security

### **Kidnapping**

There is a very high threat of kidnapping in Mali, including from terrorist groups. The threat is most significant in the north but it can occur in any part of the country.

Irish nationals may be viewed by many groups as legitimate kidnapping targets, regardless of their reasons for being in Mali.

Terrorist groups active in Mali and the wider region are capable of carrying out attacks and kidnaps over long distances. Kidnapping for ransom is the primary source of finance for some terrorist groups and criminal gangs often carry out kidnapping for terrorist groups in return for financial rewards.

Be extremely vigilant and follow these basic precautions:

* Get advice from your local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Crime**

If you travelling to Mali against our advice you should take these sensible precautions to protect yourself against crime:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
