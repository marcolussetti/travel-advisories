## Entry Requirements

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Mali.

If you are unsure about the entry requirements for Mali, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the country’s nearest Embassy or Consulate.

You can also check with them how long your passport must be valid for.

### **Passports**

It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Mali and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Lost or Stolen Passports**

If your passport is lost or stolen while you’re abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue you a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue you with an emergency travel document to get you home.

We’ll do our best to help you as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Mali there may be additional complications in processing and application for a new passport.  
You should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate to find out what you need to do to apply for a passport. They will also be able to advise you on the fees which apply.
