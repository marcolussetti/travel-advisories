## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens travelling to the United States must have a valid ESTA or US visa.

### **Electronic System for Travel Authorization**

The [**ESTA**](http://www.cbp.gov/ESTA) is an electronic registration system requiring travellers who are part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to register in advance of travelling to the US.

If you are ineligible for an ESTA or your ESTA application has been denied (including due to travel to VWP-restricted countries such as Cuba, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen), you may still apply for a Visitor Visa (details below).

### **Validity**

You can submit an ESTA application at any time prior to travel – the Department of Homeland Security recommends that it be submitted at least 72 hours in advance of travel. Once approved, it will be valid for multiple entries into the US and generally for up to two years or until your passport expires, whichever comes first.

Additional information:

* If you don’t get authorisation to travel you’ll need to go to your nearest US Diplomatic or Consular Mission and apply for a visa.
* An ESTA approval does not determine admissibility into the US. The final decision for entry to the US rests with immigration authorities at the port of entry.
* The ESTA programme does not apply if you have a visa for the US.
* Children, including infants, who are endorsed on a parent's passport must have an individual machine-readable passport or else obtain a visa in the parent's passport.

### **Visitor (B1/B2) Visa**

An alternative to travelling to the US on an ESTA is to apply for a visitor visa. This allows you to enter the US temporarily for business (visa category B-1), for tourism (visa category B-2), or for a combination of both purposes (B-1/B-2). Once obtained, US visitor visas are generally valid for a period of 10 years, allowing for a stay of up to 180 days in the US upon each entry.

Information on how to apply for a B1/B2 Visa to visit the United States can be found on the website of the [**US Embassy in Dublin**](https://ie.usembassy.gov/visas/).

Information on current US visa appointment wait times can be found [**here**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wait-times.html).

### **Transit passengers**

Those transiting through the USA will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver.

### **Transgender Irish citizens**

ESTA and visa application forms to the US require travellers to declare their sex. The US authorities have indicated that this should reflect the traveller’s biological sex at birth. Travellers who have an "X" marker on their passport or whose sex on their passport differs from sex assigned at birth should contact the Embassy of the United States of America in Dublin for further details on specific entry requirements.

### **Dual nationals**

US law requires US citizens to enter and exit the US using a US passport.

### **US entry and immigration laws**

Irish citizens intending to travel to the United States should ensure that they familiarise themselves with US entry requirements, which are detailed on the [CBP website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors). Previous convictions in the United States, misleading information about the purpose of your stay, entry without inspection, or even a slight overstay during travel can have serious consequences. Failure to adhere to US immigration law can lead to refusal of entry at the border, detention, and/or removal from the US.

As an Irish citizen, if you are detained, you have the right to contact the Embassy of Ireland or the nearest Consulate General of Ireland. To do so, you must request that the Embassy of Ireland or the nearest Consulate General of Ireland be informed of your detention.

### **Passport validity**

Ireland has an agreement with the US that allows you to enter on a current passport up to the actual date of expiration – so your Irish passport needs to be valid only for the duration of your stay in the US.

However, if you are travelling visa-free on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and your passport is valid for less than 90 days, you will be admitted only until the date on which the passport expires. If the passport is not valid for the duration of your stay, you must apply for a new passport from your nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate while in the US.

You cannot travel to the United States without a visa on an Emergency Passport.

Further details on entry requirements are available on the [**US Embassy website**](https://ie.usembassy.gov/) and you can find [**information on J1 visas in our Visa section**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/visas-for-ireland/us-ireland-holiday-working-agreement-j1/).

**Children - Child travelling with one parent or someone who is not a parent or legal guardian or a group**

Due to increasing incidents of child abductions in disputed custody cases and as possible victims of child pornography, the US authorities (CBP) strongly recommends that unless a child travelling to the US is accompanied by both parents, the adult have a note from the child's other parent (or, in the case of a child travelling with relatives other than parents, friends, or in groups such as school groups, a note signed by both parents) stating "I acknowledge that my wife/husband/etc. is travelling out of the country with my son/daughter/group. He/She/They has/have my permission to do so.” CBP also suggests that this note be notarised.

While CBP may not ask to see this documentation, if it does ask, and you do not have it, you may be detained until the circumstances of the child travelling without both parents can be fully assessed. If there is no second parent with legal claims to the child (deceased, sole custody, etc.) any other relevant paperwork, such as a court decision, birth certificate naming only one parent, death certificate, etc., would be useful.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. Medical treatment in the US is very expensive. Adequate travel insurance is essential.

We also advise any Irish citizens visiting or living in the US to follow the advice of the [**US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.**](http://www.cdc.gov/)
