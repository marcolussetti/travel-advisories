### **General Travel Advice**

Those planning to travel are advised to monitor the website of [**the US Embassy in Dublin**](https://ie.usembassy.gov/us-travel-restrictions/) for updates and to consult your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements for travel to the US.

Irish citizens require an [**ESTA**](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/esta) or visa to enter the US. Applications for an ESTA or visa must be made in advance of travel.

A valid passport is required for travel to the US. Passport cards cannot be used. Ireland has an agreement with the US that allows you to enter on a current passport up to the actual date of expiration – so your Irish passport needs to be valid only for the duration of your stay in the US.

**For more information on ESTAs, Visas and Passports, please see the Additional Information tab.**

The vast majority of visits to the United States pass without difficulty. However, citizens should be sure that they are in full compliance with US immigration requirements. Previous convictions in the United States, misleading information about the purpose of your stay on your visa or ESTA application, or even a slight previous overstay can have serious consequences. These include refusal of entry at the border, detention for periods of time, and/or removal from the US.

Visitors to US are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X @[**Embassy of Ireland, USA**](https://twitter.com/IrelandEmbUSA) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/embassyofirelandusa)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
