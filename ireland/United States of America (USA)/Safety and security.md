## Safety and security

We advise Irish citizens in the US to remain vigilant and exercise appropriate caution throughout their stays here.

Keep yourself fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media and follow the instructions of the local authorities. Follow us on social media [**@IrelandEmbUSA**](https://x.com/IrelandEmbUSA) and [**@DFATravelWise**](https://x.com/dfatravelwise) to make sure you have access to all relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

If you are in need of emergency assistance, please contact the Embassy of Ireland in Washington D.C. directly at + 1-202-462-3939 and, if outside office hours, leave a message on the answering machine.

### **Terrorism**

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides public information about credible threats. For all current alerts within the USA and its territories, visit the [**DHS website**](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system). You should expect stringent security checks at airports, transport stations and other public buildings.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in the US but you should take sensible precautions.

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t leave any belongings visible and unattended in rental cars, even for a few moments.
* Keep your wallet and important travel docs in your sight or in a safe place at all times- do not leave travel documents or wallets unattended in your cars.
* Limit the amount of cash you carry by using international credit cards.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and try not to use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check that no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a lookout for people acting suspiciously or unattended packages in public places.
* Due to heightened car thefts in the Bay Area, travellers to Northern California are advised not to leave any bags, purses or luggage visible in your vehicle while it is unattended. Ensure that all baggage is removed from your vehicle when leaving your car unattended. Your vehicle should always be in sight when your luggage/backpacks are in your car, including when checking out of your hotel.

If you are a victim of a crime while in the US, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Washington DC and the Irish Consulates in Austin, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco.

### **Driving**

If you are planning to drive in the US, be aware that cars drive on the right side of the road but otherwise road safety conditions are fairly similar to Ireland.

If you want to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags and items of value kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights, or if you are away from your car and have parked it in a public place.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you are hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you are allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
