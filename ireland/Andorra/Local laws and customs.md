## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs , traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug), carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Alcohol**

It's illegal to consume alcohol in public in Andorra and there is a penalty of â‚¬300.
