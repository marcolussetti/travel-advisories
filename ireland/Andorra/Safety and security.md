## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is a general threat from terrorism in Europe, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates. However, the threat in Andorra is considered to be low. In the event of any security incident, you should follow the instructions of the local authorities.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Andorra but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport or your passport card (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public. Check that no one can see you enter your PIN or the transaction amount, and no one has has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Andorra, report it to the local police immediately. The number for the police in Andorra is 110. You can contact us at the Irish Embassy in Madrid if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Andorra, you should take normal precautions and drive on the right-hand side, the opposite to Ireland. If you want to drive:

* Bring your full and international driving licence and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* If you are hiring a vehicle, make sure that you have all the documentation to present to police, in case required.
* Andorra has stricter drink-driving laws than most European Union countries. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* If you need to leave your vehicle as the result of a breakdown or accident, you must wear a reflective jacket. Failure to do so can result in a fine.
* Drivers must carry two red warning triangles to place in front of and behind the vehicle in the event of an accident or breakdown.
* From 1 November to 15 May, it is a legal requirement in Andorra to either have winter tyres fitted or to carry snow chains

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
