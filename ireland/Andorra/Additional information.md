## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens don’t need a visa to enter Andorra.

### **Passports**

Your passport must be valid for the planned period of your stay. You should take a number of photocopies of your passport with you and during your stay, and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times.

### **Natural disasters and climate**

If you’re travelling to Andorra, make sure you know what to expect – then plan and pack so that you’re prepared. Co-operate with local authorities and emergency services in the case of serious incidents

### **Avalanches**

If you’re going to a ski resort, take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and throughout your visit (see: [**www.avalanches.org**](https://www.avalanches.org/)).

Be alert to the risk of avalanches and always follow the safety instructions issued by the authorities at ski resorts.

### **Travel Insurance**

We can’t pay for emergency medical repatriation, repatriation of remains, or for expenses as a result of a personal emergency while you are abroad. If you buy an appropriate travel insurance policy, these costs will be covered, provided you haven’t broken the terms and conditions. If you’re planning on skiing or taking part in other winter or adventure sports, ensure that your insurance policy provides appropriate cover.

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is not valid in Andorra.

Buying comprehensive travel insurance can save you and your family a lot of money if something goes wrong. It will also ensure that you get the medical attention you need, when you need it. Hospital bills can quickly run into thousands of euro, and a medical evacuation back to Ireland can cost thousands more.

Not all policies are the same, and the cheapest one might be cheap for a reason. Make sure your policy covers all the activities you plan to do on your trip. [**Insurance Ireland recommend**](http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/general-non-life-insurance/travel) that you purchase a policy that provides a minimum medical cover of €1 million.

### **Emergency expenses**

Your policy should cover:

* All medical care abroad, including evacuation by air ambulance, or other emergency procedures, and any other costs associated with an unexpected longer stay.
* Your entire trip, from departure to return. Consider an annual multi-trip policy if you’re making more than one trip in the year.
* 24-hour emergency service and assistance.
* Personal liability cover (in case you’re sued for causing injury or damaging property).
* Lost and stolen possessions.
* Cancellation and curtailment.
* Any extra activities you intend to do that are excluded from standard policies (e.g. activities such as skiing or other winter or adventure sports).

Exclusions: You should know most insurance policies will not cover drink or drug-related incidents.
