## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal. Nicaragua has strict enforcement policies regarding illegal drugs. We advise that you do not become involved with drugs of any kind, in any way.
