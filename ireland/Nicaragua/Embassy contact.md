## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Nicaragua we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Mexico.**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/)

The Embassy operates an out of hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance on weekends and public holidays. If in need of emergency assistance during these times, leave a message on the emergency message system by calling +52 55 5520 5803. The emergency message system is checked regularly outside of office hours and a member of the Embassy staff will contact you as soon as possible.

When leaving a message, remember to state your name, the nature of the problem, where you are now, and the details of how the Duty Officer can contact you (e.g. leave your mobile phone number, or the phone number of the hotel/hostel where you are staying).

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin at +353 (0)1 408 2000.

Monday to Friday 08:30 to 17:00
