### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Nicaragua. Visitors should note that Nicaragua is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.

A valid passport is required for travel to Nicaragua. Irish passports should have a minimum of 6 months validity to enter. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Nicaragua are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Mexico on social media (Twitter@[**IrishEmbMexico**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbMexico/status/1585702058497232896/photo/3) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
