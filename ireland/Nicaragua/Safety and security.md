## Safety and security

### **Crime**

The rate of crime has risen in Nicaragua in recent years. Street crime can be common in Managua and in large towns throughout the country.

The Embassy advises caution when using public transport, including taxis. Always be vigilant, particularly after dark and take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone, and check no one has followed you
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible
* Make sure that your accommodation has adequate security
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations
* If possible, use radio-dispatched taxis. Please ensure any taxi you take is authorised (red plates, with the driver’s identification number, name and photograph clearly visible on the dashboard). Avoid sharing taxis.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Nicaragua, report it to the local police immediately. You can also contact our Embassy in Mexico on +52 55 5520 5803

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Nicaragua, you should follow these basic guidelines:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit, and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and there is a risk of being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Hurricane season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. You should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

### **Seismic and volcanic activity**

Nicaragua is prone to significant seismic and volcanic activity. If planning to visit Nicaragua, you should familiarise yourself with what to do in an earthquake, remain on alert, particularly in the event of aftershocks, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local news and websites for updates.

### **Political Unrest**

Political Demonstrations in Nicaragua have been known to turn violent. You are strongly advised to stay away from any demonstrations or gatherings. It is illegal for foreigners to be involved in local politics and participation may result in arrest.
