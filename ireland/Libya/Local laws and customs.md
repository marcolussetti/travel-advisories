## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim culture**

Local laws reflect the fact that Libya is a Muslim country. Visitors should respect local customs and sensitivities, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. Visitors are advised to dress conservatively at all times, covering arms, shoulders and legs.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, visitors should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

The working week is from Sunday to Thursday.

### **Illegal drugs**

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty or life imprisonment.

### **Alcohol**

The sale and consumption of alcohol is against the law and there are stern penalties imposed for the possession or use of alcohol. Visitors should on no account attempt to bring alcohol into the country.

### **Personal identification**

Visitors must carry identification documents at all times.

### **Law enforcement**

Severe penalties are imposed for criticising the country, its leadership or religion.

### **Sexual behaviour**

Homosexuality is considered a criminal offence in Libya. Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Photography close to military or official personnel or sites is illegal and may result in arrest or detention.

### **Driving**

Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of hostilities. There’s also a high risk of carjacking and robbery. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk. There is a risk of striking unexploded ordnance off-road. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.

Areas of Libya that border with Algeria, Niger, Chad and Sudan are very dangerous. Avoid cross-border travel between Libya and these countries. Bandits and armed tribal groups operate in these areas. There's also a very high threat of kidnapping. Violence and armed robberies have been reported as vehicles leave Libya by road. This includes roads that cross into Tunisia.

Due to the threat of violence, the Embassy advises against travel by car in Libya. However should visitors chose to drive in Libya, be extremely careful and follow these basic guidelines:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
