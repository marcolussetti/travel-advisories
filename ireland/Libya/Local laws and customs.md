## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Muslim Culture**

Local laws reflect the fact that Libya is a Muslim country. Visitors should respect local customs and sensitivities, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. Visitors are advised to dress conservatively at all times, covering arms, shoulders and legs.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, visitors should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.

The working week is from Sunday to Thursday.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty or life imprisonment.

### **Alcohol**

The sale and consumption of alcohol is against the law and there are stern penalties imposed for the possession or use of alcohol. Visitors should on no account attempt to bring alcohol into the country.

### **Personal Identification**

Visitors must carry identification documents at all times.

### **Law Enforcement**

Severe penalties are imposed for criticising the country, its leadership or religion.

### **Sexual Behaviour**

Homosexuality is considered a criminal offence in Libya. Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Photography close to military or official personnel or sites is illegal and may result in arrest or detention.

### **Money**

Libya is a cash-based society. Credit cards are not widely used and there are few reliable ATMs. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not accepted.

### **Foreign Currency**

All tourists (regardless of age) must have a minimum amount of foreign currency, equivalent to 1,000 US Dollars, when they enter the country. If you do not have sufficient funds, you may be deported and the airline who carried you may be fined.

You may be required to prove that you meet this requirement to an Immigration Officer when you arrive in Libya. Some visitors who are travelling for purposes other than tourism are exempted from this requirement; contact the nearest Libyan Embassy for further details.
