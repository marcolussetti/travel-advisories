## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens need a visa for travel to Libya. Contact the nearest Libyan Embassy for more information on visa requirements.

### **Passports**

Passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the date of your intended departure and should not bear an Israeli visa or border stamp.

Libya has introduced a requirement for all passports to contain an Arabic translation of the personal details page. The Passport Office and some Irish missions can provide a template in Arabic to which your personal details can be added by a translator.

The translator should place his/her seal on the translation. Translations must be afixed in the passport; a separate document will not be accepted. Please make contact with the Passport Office or your nearest Irish Embassy for further information.

### **Registration**

All tourists and short stay visitors must register their passports with the police within one week of arrival. If travelling with a tour group or travel agent this is normally arranged for you. Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to being fined when you come to leave the country.

### **Health**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations for Libya are required.

### **Money**

Libya is a cash-based society. Credit cards are not widely used and there are few reliable ATMs. Travellersâ€™ cheques are not accepted.

### **Foreign currency**

All tourists (regardless of age) must have a minimum amount of foreign currency, equivalent to 1,000 US Dollars, when they enter the country. If you do not have sufficient funds, you may be deported and the airline who carried you may be fined.

You may be required to prove that you meet this requirement to an Immigration Officer when you arrive in Libya. Some visitors who are travelling for purposes other than tourism are exempted from this requirement; contact the nearest Libyan Embassy for further details.
