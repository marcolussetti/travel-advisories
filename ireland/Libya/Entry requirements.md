## Entry requirements

### **Visa**

Irish citizens need a visa for travel to Libya. Contact the nearest Libyan Embassy for more information on visa requirements.

### **Passport**

Passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the date of your intended departure and should not bear an Israeli visa or border stamp.

Libya has introduced a requirement for all passports to contain an Arabic translation of the personal details page. The Passport Office and some Irish missions can provide a template in Arabic to which your personal details can be added by a translator.

The translator should place his/her seal on the translation. Translations must be afixed in the passport; a separate document will not be accepted. Please make contact with the Passport Office or your nearest Irish Embassy for further information.

### **Registration**

All tourists and short stay visitors must register their passports with the police within one week of arrival. If travelling with a tour group or travel agent this is normally arranged for you. Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to being fined when you come to leave the country.
