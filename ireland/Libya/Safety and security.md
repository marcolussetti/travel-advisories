## Safety and security

### **Security**

Due to the ongoing fighting and the risk of kidnapping or terrorist attacks throughout the country, the situation in Libya remains very volatile. The situation throughout the country remains dangerous and unpredictable. Fighting continues in many parts of Libya. It can be unclear in some areas which faction has control. This fighting includes extremist groups such as Ansar Al Sharia and affiliates of Da’esh and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M).

We advise Irish citizens in Libya to leave immediately by commercial means.

Military clashes and inter-militia fighting pose significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Maitiga Airport, Tripoli’s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery.

A limited number of flights may be operating from Misrata and Maitega airports. As flight schedules may change without notice, you should contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling. Land routes remain open but the security situation can change very quickly. There may be some delays and temporary closures at border crossings. We recommend checking the situation at the border immediately before intended travel.

### **Political Stability**

The political situation in Libya remains fragile and the security situation remains dangerous and unpredictable. Uncertainty about when postponed Libyan elections will take place is likely to heighten tensions throughout the country, which may lead to security incidents such as inter-militia clashes and oil blockades.

Since April 2019 there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces across western and central Libya. Regular and heavy armed clashes also take place to the south and west of Tripoli.

Fighting can break out anywhere without warning, including between local militia groups, and many civilians have been killed in outbreaks of conflict in residential areas. There is a high risk of being caught in indiscriminate gunfire or shelling, including air strikes, in all areas where the fighting has spread.

### **Terrorism**

There is a very high threat of terrorist attacks and of kidnap against foreigners in Libya.

### **Crime**

There is a serious threat of crime targeted at foreigners in Libya including theft, kidnappings and carjacking. Irish citizens, who remain in Libya against our advice are advised to move around the country with extreme caution.

Some general precautions to protect yourself from crime while in Libya include:

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Driving**

Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of hostilities. There’s also a high risk of carjacking and robbery. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk. There is a risk of striking unexploded ordnance off-road. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.

Areas of Libya that border with Algeria, Niger, Chad and Sudan are very dangerous. Avoid cross-border travel between Libya and these countries. Bandits and armed tribal groups operate in these areas. There's also a very high threat of kidnapping. Violence and armed robberies have been reported as vehicles leave Libya by road. This includes roads that cross into Tunisia.

Due to the threat of violence, the Embassy advises against travel by car in Libya. However should visitors chose to drive in Libya, be extremely careful and follow these basic guidelines:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
