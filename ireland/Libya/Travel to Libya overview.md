## Travel to Libya overview

### Security Status

Do Not Travel

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against travel to Libya at this time**.

Due to the ongoing fighting and the risk of kidnapping or terrorist attacks throughout the country, the situation in Libya remains extremely dangerous. There are reports of increased military activity in the areas surrounding Tripoli and in the city itself and all Irish citizens are advised to avoid the region.

As Ireland has no resident Embassy in Libya, and in light of the deteriorating security situation, it is extremely unlikely that we will be able to provide any consular assistance to Irish citizens who travel to or decide to remain in Libya at this time.

Irish citizens who decide to travel to or remain in Libya are doing so at their own risk and **against** the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If citizens remain in Libya, exercise caution, avoid large gatherings and ensure that appropriate personal security measures are in place, including access to money and supplies of food, water, medicine, fuel and other essentials.

Should citizens chose to travel **against** the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, it is essential to ensure that your passport and those of your immediate family are valid and up to date. Citizens should also ensure that they have all relevant travel/exit documents that may be required for departure from Libya.

**Contact details Embassy of Ireland to Italy**

As there is no Irish Embassy in Libya, we are limited in the help we can offer citizens in an emergency. The Embassy of Ireland in Rome, Italy, is accredited to Libya. Contact details are [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/italy/rome/).

Visitors to Libya are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on the official X account [**@IrlEmbRome**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbRome) to ensure access to any relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if visitors have problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

The Embassy of Ireland in Rome operates an out-of-hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance. If in need of emergency assistance, please ring the Embassy on (+39) 06 5852 381 and leave a message giving your name, mobile number, current location and the nature of the emergency. The answering machine is monitored regularly, and the Duty Officer will contact you. Contact details are [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/italy/rome/).

### **EU Directive on Consular Protection**

Under the EU Consular Protection Directive, Irish nationals may seek assistance from the Embassy or Consulate of any other EU member state in a country where there is no Irish Embassy or permanent representation. We advise contacting the Embassy that you intend seeking assistance from in advance of going there in case it is no longer open. Please exercise extreme caution in your movements around any areas where there is military activity.
