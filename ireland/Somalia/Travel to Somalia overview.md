## Travel to Somalia overview

### **Security status**

Do Not Travel

### **Travel Alert**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to Somalia at this time.**

The security environment in Somalia is extremely unpredictable with a ongoing high threat of domestic terrorism, especially in south-central Somalia and Mogadishu. Intelligence reports suggest that there continues to be a threat to foreigners in Somalia.

If you are currently in Somalia, we advise you to exercise caution at all times, and to register with the Embassy of Ireland in Kenya [**here**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/).

### **General Travel Advice**

**The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all travel to Somalia at this time** due to the unpredictable security environment and ongoing high threat of domestic terrorism.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Somalia, including Somaliland.

A valid passport is required for travel to Somalia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Somalia are advised to follow the guidance of relevant authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media ([**X@IrlEmbKenya**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbKenya)) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/irishembassyinkenya/)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.
