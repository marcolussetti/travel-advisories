### **Get travel and medical insurance**

Before travelling, the Department **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but information can be obtained from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

**Polio vaccination** is recommended for all travellers from Ireland to countries where polio transmission is a risk. Before travelling to areas where poliomyelitis cases are still occurring, travellers should ensure that they have completed the recommended age-appropriate polio vaccine schedule and have received a booster dose, if necessary. More information is available on the [**Health Protection and Surveillance Centre website**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/polio/).

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.

### **Water**

It is advisable to boil tap water before drinking it, or stick to bottled water.
