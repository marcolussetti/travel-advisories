## Safety and security

### **Security**

Somalia is a conflict zone and we advise against all travel to the country.

However, if currently in Somalia, you should keep yourself informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your local contacts or hotel. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can turn confrontational and stay away from military sites – taking photos, of or near, military or security installations, and some public buildings, may be prohibited.

### **Terrorism**

There is a high threat to westerners and western interests from terrorism in Somalia, including Somaliland. These attacks could be indiscriminate, and could include crowded places, high-profile events, events involving government officials and places frequented by foreigners.

### **Piracy**

Piracy has been a major problem along the Somali coastline.

### **Kidnapping**

Westerners and those working for Western organisations have been targeted in attacks, including kidnappings. If remaining in Somalia against our advice, follow these basic precautions:

* Get advice from your local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Crime**

As well as the ongoing armed conflict, there has been a consistently dangerous level of criminal activity in Somalia over the last few years; always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag snatching from vehicles stopped at traffic lights
