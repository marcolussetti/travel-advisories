## Additional information

For information regarding the entry requirements for Somalia, including visa and other immigration information, ask your travel agent or contact the nearest Somali Embassy or Consulate.

### **Visas**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Somalia, including Somaliland.

### **Passports**

A valid passport is required for travel to Somalia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport if travelling to Somalia and to carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help.

What we can do:

* Issue a replacement passport that will let you finish your trip, or;
* Issue an emergency travel document to get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Location and circumstances may limit the help we can give. As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Somalia there may be additional complications in processing an application for a new passport.

Citizens should contact the Embassy of Ireland to Kenya in Nairobi to find out what to do to apply for a passport.
