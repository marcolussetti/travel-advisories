### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **COVID-19**

From July 2023 DRC removed all COVID-19 related entry requirements. Proof of either vaccination or a negative test result is no longer required. COVID-19 related exit requirements were removed in 2022.

### **Medical Facilities**

The Centre Prive d'Urgence (CPU) clinic in Kinshasa is able to cope with basic health problems and to stabilise a patient after most serious accidents. Medical evacuation is advisable as soon as possible. Outside Kinshasa, western standard medical facilities are practically non-existent.

### **Malaria**

Malaria is prevalent in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before travelling, get up-to-date medical advice as to whether you will need anti-malarial medication. On arrival, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Other Illnesses**

DRC has experienced a number of Ebola outbreaks in recent years. There are also currently outbreaks of cholera, measles, monkey pox, plague, yellow fever and vaccine-derived polio.

### **HIV and AIDS**

HIV/AIDS is prevalent in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Exercise necessary caution if engaging in activities that expose you to possible infection. If you suspect that you have been exposed to possible infection, seek immediate medical attention.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but information on vaccinations can be obtained from a local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.

### **Medication**

Make sure to bring enough medication for entire trip and for any unexpected delays. Also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
