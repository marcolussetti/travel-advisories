### **Travel Alert**

Conflict escalation in eastern DRC: Increased conflict and fighting, including shelling in populated areas, has been reported in January 2025. DFA advises against all travel to eastern DRC, in particular Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu.

As of 27 January, Goma airport is not functional and lake traffic is not authorised. The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma could close at short notice. Information is changing on a daily basis.

Irish citizens planning to cross the border to Rwanda should familiarise themselves with the relevant [DFA Travel Advice](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/rwanda/#:~:text=General%20Travel%20Advice,see%20the%20Additional%20Information%20tab.). Please note Rwanda is covered by the Embassy of Ireland in Kampala.

Protests: Violent protests can break out quickly in urban centres with little warning. On 28 January there were large and violent protests outside multiple embassies and offices of international organisations in Kinshasa. Stay alert and avoid any protests. Carry an identification document, limit movements and be cautious if you are travelling at night.

Mpox: there has been an upsurge of mpox in the DRC and a number of countries in Africa. On 14 August 2024 the WHO classified this outbreak as a [public health emergency of international concern](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern). Individuals in DRC or considering travel to DRC should follow local public health instructions and updates.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter DRC.

A valid passport is required for travel to DRC. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visa and passport requirements, please see the Additional Information tab.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Tanzania on X [**@IrlEmbTanzania**](https://twitter.com/irlembtanzania?lang=en) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management. If a victim of crime, notify the nearest police station or gendarmerie. Emergency services are unreliable and there is no reliable equivalent to calling 999.
