## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Tanzania.**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/tanzania/daressalaam/)

In cases of an emergency outside of regular office hours, the Embassy can be contacted by calling the Duty Officer directly on +255 754 783 455.

Monday to Thursday 08:00 - 16:30, Friday 08:00 - 14:00
