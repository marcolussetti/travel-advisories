## Additional information

### **Visas**

All Irish nationals need to obtain a visa prior to travelling to DRC issued by the nearest Democratic Republic of Congo [**Embassy**](/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/). It is no longer possible to buy a short-term pass at the border to enter the country. Irish nationals living in Ireland can apply for a visa through the DRC Embassy in London:

The Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

281 Gray’s Inn Road

London

WC1X 8QF

Telephone: 0207 580 3931

Email: [**info@ambardc-londres.gouv.cd**](mailto:info@ambardc-londres.gouv.cd)

Check requirements with the DRC Embassy in London depending on the type of visa required and allow at least 2 to 3 weeks for visa processing.

### **Passports**

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to the Democratic Republic of Congo and carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

If your passport is lost or stolen while abroad, we can help by issuing an emergency travel document that will get you home. We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give.

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in DRC there may be additional complications in issuing an emergency travel document. Contact our [**Irish Embassy in Tanzania**](/en/tanzania/daressalaam/) to find out what is needed to apply for an emergency travel document. They will also be able to advise on the fees which apply.

### **Departure tax**

There is a departure tax of $55 per passenger on international flights and $10 per passenger on domestic flights. These are official fees paid when checking in. Get an official receipt plus a copy for each fee. The originals should be handed on request to immigration and at boarding, and keep the copies.

### **Climate**

The climate in the Democratic Republic of Congo is tropical. It is generally hot and humid in the equatorial river basin. The southern highlands are cooler and drier. The eastern highlands are cool and wet.
