## Safety and security

### **EU Directive on Consular Protection**

The [**Embassies, Consulates of other EU countries**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/eu-consular-protection-directive/) can be contacted for emergency consular assistance, advice and support. Please note however that the lack of infrastructure throughout the country and continued insecurity in eastern DRC often prevent these Missions from providing normal levels of consular assistance.

### **Unrest and Demonstrations**

The political situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is fragile. Things can deteriorate quickly and dangerous incidents can happen. For this reason, we advise against non-essential travel to the country, particularly all travel to the eastern, north-eastern and Bas-Congo areas, including the town of Goma.

Be aware that if unrest in the country worsens, commercial flights may be suspended and border crossing points closed. This will restrict your ability to leave the country.

### **Border Areas**

If travelling to the DRC, avoid entering or leaving overland from Uganda, Rwanda or Burundi except via Goma and Bukavu and be extremely careful at crossing points. The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi/Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu are liable to closure at short notice. DRC’s borders with all of its neighbours can be subject to closure at short notice including with Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. You must have the correct documentation for to enter the country, including a visa issued by the nearest DRC Embassy to your country of residence. It is no longer possible to buy a short-term pass at the border to enter the country.

### **Crime**

Crime is on the rise, particularly in Kinshasa, be extremely careful, especially at night and always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.

### **Street Crime**

In Kinshasa, robberies by gangs of street children are increasingly common and becoming more aggressive. Always stick to the main thoroughfares when driving and make sure that to park in a supervised area.

### **Reporting Crime**

There is no emergency services number in the Democratic Republic of Congo, equivalent to the 999 service in Ireland.

If a victim of crime, notify the nearest police station or gendarmerie. However, be aware that laws and regulations are not administered consistently in the DRC and legal recourse in cases of theft and robbery is limited. If assistance is required, contact the [**Irish Embassy in Tanzania**](/en/tanzania/daressalaam/).

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Democratic Republic of Congo, be extremely careful. Roads are generally in poor condition, and often impassable in the rainy season. If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law
* Be aware of Democratic Republic of Congo’s traffic laws, such as speed limits
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights
* Stick to the main routes  and always park in a supervised area

### **Roadblocks**

Travellers are frequently detained and questioned by poorly disciplined security forces at numerous official and unofficial roadblocks and border crossings throughout the country. Requests for bribes in such instances are common, and security forces are reported to have occasionally injured or killed people who refuse to pay.

### **Hiring a Vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).
