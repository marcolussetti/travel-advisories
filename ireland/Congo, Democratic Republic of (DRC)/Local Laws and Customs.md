## Local Laws and Customs

### **Practical Advice**

* Read our travel advice, inform yourself before travelling and get advice locally when you arrive
* Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them
* Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal

### **Photography**

Taking photos of, or near, military or security installations and staff, and some public buildings, is prohibited and can result in arrest and detention.

### **Departure Tax**

There is a departure tax of $55 per passenger on international flights and $10 per passenger on domestic flights. These are official fees paid when checking in. Get an official receipt plus a copy for each fee. The originals should be handed on request to immigration and at boarding, and keep the copies.
