## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Moldova, consular assistance is provided via the [**Embassy of Ireland in Bucharest, Romania**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/romania/bucharest/).

In case of a genuine consular emergency while the Embassy is closed, please leave a message with name, location and telephone number at +4021 310 2131 and the Duty Officer will call you back.

Alternatively, the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin can be contacted at +353-1-408-2000.

Monday to Friday 09:30 to 12:30; 14:00 to 17:00
