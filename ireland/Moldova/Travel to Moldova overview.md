## Travel to Moldova overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Due to the regional security situation, Irish citizens should exercise a high degree of caution regarding travel to the Republic of Moldova. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine together with our EU and other international partners.  Current travel advice in relation to Ukraine is available [**here**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/advice/ukraine/).

Irish citizens who wish to enter Moldova from Ukraine should do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova and Ukraine in the north and south of the country. Irish citizens should not attempt to enter Moldova from Ukraine via Transnistria.

Irish citizens should not travel to Transnistria, which is outside the control of the Moldovan Government.

We encourage all Irish citizens in Moldova to [**register their details**](/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) with the Irish Embassy in Bucharest and to monitor our social media channels for the latest updates**.**

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Moldova.

A valid passport is required for travel to Moldova. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of three months after the date of departure from Moldova.

For more information on visa and passport requirements, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Moldova are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (X [**@IrishEmbBuch**](https://twitter.com/IrishEmbBuch)) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbassyBucharest)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Moldova by dialling 112.
