## Safety and security

### Crime

As elsewhere, visitors should be alert to the risk of street crime and petty theft, including pickpockets and bag snatchers, particularly in Chişinău.

It is useful to carry a small torch after dark, as street lighting is often poor or non-existent.

### **Transport**

Public transport in Chişinău and throughout the Republic of Moldova is not as well as developed as elsewhere and motorways are few and far between.  Rail, bus and taxis are, however, relatively inexpensive.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in the Republic of Moldova, you should be extremely careful.

* Irish and international driving licences are valid in the Republic of Moldova.
* Some Moldovans drive erratically and at excessive speeds and vehicles are not always fully roadworthy.  Serious road traffic accidents regularly occur. Visitors entering the Republic of Moldova by road or driving there should ensure that they have adequate insurance cover. Insurance companies or brokers should be consulted in advance about this, if necessary. Drivers should be in possession of original car ownership and insurance documents.
* The quality of road surfaces in the Republic of Moldova can be uneven. Travel by road in remoter areas should be restricted to primary routes, and daylight hours.
* In the event of an accident involving another vehicle, await police permission before moving your own vehicle.
* In winter, drivers should ensure that vehicles are prepared for extreme weather conditions, including fitting mandatory winter tyres.
