As there is no Irish Embassy in Haiti, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if assistance is required, contact the [**Embassy of Ireland to the USA in Washington DC**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/washington/).

If you are an Irish citizen and in urgent need of emergency assistance, please contact the Embassy at + 1-202-462-3939 and leave a message on the answering machine. The answering machine is monitored regularly and the Duty Officer will contact you as soon as possible in cases where it is a genuine emergency.

Alternatively, you may contact the Duty Officer at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin at + 353-1-408 2000.

Monday to Friday 09:00-13:00 and 14:00-16:00
