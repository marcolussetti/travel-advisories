## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

The security situation in Haiti is extremely volatile. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings, which can turn confrontational. You should take appropriate security precautions and keep yourself informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or local contacts.

### **Kidnapping**

Foreign nationals are potential targets for kidnapping, take particular care when travelling in Haiti:

* Get advice from local contacts about staying safe
* Avoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city
* Avoid travelling alone
* When driving, ensure all car doors are locked
* Vary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked
* Pay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities

### **Crime**

There is a high risk of crime within Haiti, including armed robberies, burglaries, attacks on vehicles and murder. Be vigilant when travelling to or within Haiti and follow some basic safety precautions:

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a photocopy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafes, train and bus stations.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Reporting a crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Haiti, report it to the local police immediately.
