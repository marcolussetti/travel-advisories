Irish citizens who are planning to visit Mauritius for less than 90 days, do not require a visa before arriving. A visa, normally valid for three months, will be issued on arrival if you hold a valid Irish passport and have a return ticket.

If visiting for longer than 90 days please consult your nearest [**Embassy or Consulate**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies-in-ireland/) of Mauritius before travelling.

A valid passport is required for travel to Mauritius and Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months from the intended date of departure from Mauritius. Passport cards cannot be used. Passports must have at least two blank pages and must not be damaged in any way. If your passport fails on either count, it will be not be accepted by the Mauritian authorities.

While there are no COVID-19 travel requirements or restrictions in place to enter Mauritius, all passengers are required to complete the [**Mauritius All-in-One Travel Form**](https://safemauritius.govmu.org/) prior to arrival.

Visitors to Mauritius are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.
