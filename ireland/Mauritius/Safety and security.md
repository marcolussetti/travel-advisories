## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Mauritius is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

In May 2016 gunshots were fired in the capital, Port Louis, at the French Embassy and at a hotel that is popular with tourists, and Islamic State graffiti was also sprayed on the Embassy's wall. As a consequence, security on the island has been strengthened, especially around Embassies and High Commissions.

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Mauritius are low but pickpocketing, bag snatching, theft and other petty crime against tourists can happen. Street robberies near or at ATMs have been reported. There have been incidents of assault, rape and murder, including in resorts. Security risks increase after dark especially on beaches, poorly-lit city streets and in other secluded areas.

The rate of crime is higher in downtown Port Louis, and in the coastal tourist centres of Grand Bay, Pereybere, and Flic en Flac. There have been incidents of tourists being assaulted and robbed while staying at beachside bungalows run by unregistered proprietors.

Mauritian authorities have introduced camera surveillance around the country, particularly in high tourist areas.

* Be alert to your surroundings and pay attention to belongings at all times.
* Carry only what you need. Leave other valuables in a secure location.
* Do not tempt thieves – avoid displaying expensive watches, jewelry, phones and cameras.
* Avoid walking alone at night.

Avoid using ATMs on the street. Use ATMs in banks, shops, hotels or shopping centres whenever possible. Stay alert when withdrawing cash

Mauritius has generally low levels of violent crime but take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
* Avoid walking alone at night on deserted/public beaches or in poorly-lit areas especially in the back streets of the business district of Port Louis

### **Petty theft**

Petty crime is common, with many active pickpockets and purse snatchers in popular tourist areas including Port Louis, Grand Baie and Flic en Flac. We recommend that you keep valuables in hotel safes, where possible, and make copies of important documents, including passports.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Mauritius, report it to the local police immediately. Please contact the Irish Embassy in Pretoria if you need help.

### **Driving**

If planning to drive in Mauritius, be careful. Traffic drives on the left, the standard of driving varies and there are frequent minor accidents. Be particularly careful when driving after dark as roads are often narrow and uneven with inadequate lighting.

If planning to drive:

* Bring your full Irish driver’s licence and international driving permit, and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware of Mauritius’s traffic laws, such as speed limits, which are posted in kilometres per hour. All road and traffic signs are posted in English.
* Speed limits are strictly enforced; camera speed checks are very common and speeding fines are substantial.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* Drivers and passengers on motorcycles are required to wear helmets.

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Water safety**

While there have been no attacks by pirates in Mauritian waters, vessels have been attacked up to 1,000 miles off the Somali coast. Sailing vessels are especially vulnerable so we advise not to travel in yachts or pleasure craft in international waters in this part of the Indian Ocean.
