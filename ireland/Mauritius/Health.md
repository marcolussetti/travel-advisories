### **Get Travel and Medical Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade **strongly recommends** that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all the activities you want to undertake.

### **Medical Facilities**

Good private healthcare in Mauritius is available, although this can be costly if you are not insured. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and can access funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 or 114 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Prescription Medication**

If you need prescription medication, we advise bringing copies of your prescription with you. Scheduled drugs, such as psychotropic preparations (e.g. tranquillisers, hypnotics), narcotics (e.g. morphine) and other strong painkillers must be authorised by the authorities before they can be brought into the country. If you do not get prior authorisation, you could be arrested.

Contact the [**Mauritian High Commission in London**](https://mauritius-london.govmu.org/Pages/index.aspx) if you think your prescription medications may need prior authorisation.

### **Stonefish Stings**

Stonefish stings are uncommon but can in some cases be fatal. You should get urgent medical attention if stung. Many hotels stock anti-venom serum.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be needed for your trip at least eight weeks before travel. We cannot advise on vaccinations, but information can be obtained from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

Evidence of vaccination (in the form of a certificate) can be a requirement for entry to some countries.
