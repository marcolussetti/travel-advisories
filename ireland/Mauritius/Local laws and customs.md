## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal identification**

The police sometimes ask foreigners to show identification. We recommend carrying photocopies of the relevant pages of your passport and driving licence, and to leave the original in a safe place.

### **Illegal drugs**

The Mauritian authorities take a serious approach to drug trafficking. Attempts to import even very small amounts are punished severely. Prosecutions can take over a year to come to court, with detention the norm until the trial. Bail is not usually granted for drug-related crimes, regardless of the type of drug. It is also illegal to possess or import cigarette papers.

### **LGBT**

Homosexuality is not illegal in Mauritius, but please bear in mind that society in general is quite traditional in its outlook. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.
