## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low in Bermuda but there is a moderate level of petty theft and street crime so you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
* Be careful when wandering after dark or visiting remote or isolated locations

### **Reporting Crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime while in Bermuda, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact the [**Honorary Consul in Hamilton**](/en/dfa/embassies/) if you need help.
