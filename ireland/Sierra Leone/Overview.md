## Overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

Demonstrations and protests and other incidents of insecurity can occur in Sierra Leone at any time, and on occasion have resulted in violence.

We encourage citizens to follow official news sources and to remain vigilant with regard to the general security situation. Irish citizens are also encouraged to contact their airline or travel agent in the event of planned travel in or out of Sierra Leone to confirm the operations of their respective flight.

All citizens are advised to be vigilant, keep up to date with local developments, and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. **It is advisable to carry ID at all times and follow the advice and instructions of the authorities. For more information in this regard please see the Safety and Security tab, Crime section.** If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately and monitor local media, including social media, for up-to-date information.

It is strongly recommended that Irish citizens travelling to or in Sierra Leone [**register with the Embassy**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/) of Ireland in Freetown.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Sierra Leone. E-visas can be obtained [**online**](http://www.evisa.sl/). A single-entry visa costs $80, multi-entry costs $160.

All inbound and outbound passengers from international airports in Sierra Leone are required to pay a $25 airport security fee prior to travel. Payment can be made [**online**](https://securipass.sl/), via Orange Money or Afrimoney, or at any branch of United Bank for Africa (UBA) or Sierra Leone Commercial Bank (SLCB).

Travellers to Sierra Leone are also required to show evidence of a yellow fever vaccination.

A valid passport is required for travel to Sierra Leone. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Visitors to Sierra Leone are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

Citizens can also follow the Embassy on social media on X [**@IrlEmbFreetown**](https://twitter.com/IrlEmbFreetown) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrlEmbFreetown) to ensure access to latest updates and alerts.

### **Petty Crime**

Visitors to Sierra Leone should be aware of the prevalence of petty crime such as pick-pocketing and bag snatching in urban areas, particularly around Lumley Beach and should take necessary precautions.

Local police often lack the resources to deal effectively with serious criminal incidents.

Find more advice and information under the safety and security tab.

### **Limitations in Electricity**

Power supply remains unreliable year round, especially during the dry season (October to May). Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies. Travellers are advised to carry power banks to enable them to charge phones and other devices.

### **Accidents and Emergencies**

If planning to drive in Sierra Leone, be extremely careful as traffic accidents are common. Emergency medical services in Sierra Leone are very limited and poorly equipped to deal with road traffic accidents, particularly those involving complex trauma. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised when using the road, either as a driver or as a passenger.

The availability and quality of medical services in Sierra Leone is poor. Citizens should be aware that you may have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas. If treatment, you may be asked to pay up front. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, be aware that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment. Bring enough medication with you for the duration of your visit.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives, employer or hotel management.
