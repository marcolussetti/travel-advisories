The availability and quality of medical services in Sierra Leone is poor. Visitors should be aware that there may be have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas. If treatment is required, you may be asked to pay up front.

### **Pre-existing Medical Condition**

If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment.

### **Medication**

If you choose to travel, bring enough medication for the duration of your visit and any unexpected delays.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, we strongly recommend obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all planned activities while in Sierra Leone.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be required in advance of travel. We cannot provide advice on vaccinations, but your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre can advise.

The yellow fever vaccination is an entry requirement for Sierra Leone and a yellow fever vaccination certificate will be requested by border control on arrival in the country.

### **Water**

Mains water is limited, and tap water must be boiled before drinking it. Bottled water is readily available.

### **Ebola and Lassa Fever**

Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg viruses are acute viral haemorrhagic fever illnesses transmitted to humans via contact with contaminated food or household items; or through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. More information about Ebola is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease).

Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa. If you are concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, seek immediate medical advice. Further information on Lassa fever is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever).

### **M-Pox**

The M-Pox virus originated in Central and West Africa. In January 2025 the government of Sierra Leone declared a national health emergency following the identification of a number of cases. Symptoms include a rash that develops blisters, along with fever and swollen lymph nodes. Further information on M-Pox can be obtained on the Centre for Disease Control and World Health Organisation websites.

### **General Advice**

We advise Irish citizens working in medical facilities or caring for sick people in Sierra Leone to take particular care and seek expert advice on infection prevention.

If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Sierra Leone, or in the few weeks following your departure from Sierra Leone, telephone a GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history; you may require immediate investigation and treatment.

Malaria, including cerebral malaria which can be fatal within 72 hours, is endemic in Sierra Leone and we strongly recommend using a malaria prophylaxis, together with other precautions such as using bed nets and insect repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers. Bring enough malaria treatment for the duration of your visit. Malaria test- kits are widely available in pharmacies in Sierra Leone, and can be useful for self-testing in the days after your visit.
