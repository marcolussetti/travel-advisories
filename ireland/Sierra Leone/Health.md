## Health

The availability and quality of medical services in Sierra Leone is poor. Visitors should be aware that there may be have difficulty accessing even basic medical services, particularly in remote areas. If treatment is required, you may be asked to pay up front. If you have a pre-existing medical condition or underlying health concerns, you should note that it may not be possible to get appropriate drugs or treatment. If you choose to travel, bring enough medication for the duration of your visit and any unexpected delays.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, we strongly recommend obtaining comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all planned activities while in Sierra Leone.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations may be required at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot provide advice on vaccinations, but your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre can advise.

The yellow fever vaccination is an entry requirement for Sierra Leone and a yellow fever vaccination certificate will be requested by border control on arrival in the country.

### **Communicable** **diseases**

#### **Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg virus**

Ebola, Lassa fever and Marburg viruses are acute viral haemorrhagic fever illnesses transmitted to humans via contact with contaminated food or household items; or through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

In February 2021, there was confirmation of an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea close to the border with Sierra Leone. Following increased surveillance and preventative measures, this outbreak was declared over in June 2021.  More information about Ebola is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease).

Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa.  Between January and March 2022, a total of 20 cases of Lassa fever were reported, which resulted in 11 deaths.  If you are concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa fever, seek immediate medical advice.    Further information on Lassa fever is available from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever).

Neighbouring Guinea also recorded an outbreak of the Marburg virus in August 2021, however this was declared over in September 2021. You can find more information on Marburg virus from the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease).

#### **M-Pox**

The M-Pox virus originated in Central and West Africa. In January 2025 the government of Sierra Leone declared a national health emergency following the identification of a number of cases. Symptoms include a rash that develops blisters, along with fever and swollen lymph nodes. Further information on M-Pox can be obtained on the Centre for Disease Control and World Health Organisation websites.

#### **General Advice**

We advise Irish citizens working in medical facilities or caring for sick people in Sierra Leone to take particular care and seek expert advice on infection prevention.

If you develop fever, unexplained fatigue, diarrhoea or any other severe symptoms while in Sierra Leone, or in the few weeks following your departure from Sierra Leone, telephone a GP or Accident and Emergency Department mentioning your symptoms and your travel history; you may require immediate investigation and treatment.
