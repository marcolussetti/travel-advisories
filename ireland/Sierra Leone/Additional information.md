## Additional information

### **Airport Transfers**

Freetown International airport is situated on the far side of a wide estuary from Freetown. There are several transfer options from Lungi airport: road, ferry, and water taxi. The journey by road can take up to five hours and is not recommended after dark; and the ferry lacks basic safety equipment. We therefore recommend the water taxi as the safest option for travel to the city. There are two water taxi companies: Seabird and Seacoach. Both depart from Freetown International Airport at Lungi and cost $45 for a single journey or local currency equivalent.

### **Visa/Passport**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Sierra Leone. E-visas can be obtained [**online**](http://www.evisa.sl/). A single-entry visa costs $80, multi-entry costs $160. Travellers to Sierra Leone are also required to show evidence of vaccination against yellow fever.

A valid passport is required for travel to Sierra Leone. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months. Passport cards cannot be used.

#### **Payment of airport security fee**

All inbound and outbound passengers from international airports in Sierra Leone are required to pay a $25 airport security fee prior to travel.  Payment can be made online at [**www.securipass.sl**](http://www.securipass.sl/).

### **Currency**

Sierra Leone is a cash-based economy; it is advisable to bring enough cash to cover expenses while in the country. Credit cards and travellers’ cheques are rarely accepted so do not rely on them.  Although there are a number of ATMs in Freetown, the security of the transactions cannot be guaranteed and they have had less cash available since redenomination commenced. The exchange rate given by ATMs is also highly unfavourable.

The government has prohibited the use of foreign currency in the country; you will not be able to pay in Euro or US dollars locally. Foreign currency can be exchanged for Leones in banks or official foreign-exchange offices. Always be careful when carrying cash.

### **Climate**

The climate in Sierra Leone is consistently hot and humid year round, with temperatures fluctuating between 25 and 35 degrees Celsius. The dry season extends from November to April and the rainy season lasts from May to October. The rainy season brings extremely heavy rainfalls and thunderstorms, which can lead to flash floods and landslides in exceptional circumstances as well as deteriorating road conditions.

### **Language**

English is the official language of Sierra Leone and is widely spoken in Freetown. Krio, an English-based creole dialect, is the lingua franca of Sierra Leone and is widely spoken across the country.

### **Water and Power**

Mains water is limited, and tap water must be boiled before drinking it. Bottled water is readily available.

Power supply remains unreliable, particularly during the dry season. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.
