## Entry requirements

### **Airport Transfers**

Freetown International airport is situated on the far side of a wide estuary from Freetown. There are several transfer options from Lungi airport: road, ferry, and water taxi. The journey by road can take up to five hours and is not recommended after dark; and the ferry lacks basic safety equipment. We therefore recommend the water taxi as the safest option for travel to the city. There are two water taxi companies: Seabird and Seacoach. Both depart from Freetown International Airport at Lungi and cost $45 for a single journey or local currency equivalent.

### **Visa**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Sierra Leone. E-visas can be obtained [**online**](http://www.evisa.sl/). A single-entry visa costs $80, multi-entry costs $160. Travellers to Sierra Leone are also required to show evidence of vaccination against yellow fever.
