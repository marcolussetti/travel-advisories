## Safety and security

### **Political Situation**

Demonstrations and protests can occur on Sierra Leone and on occasion have resulted in violence. All citizens are advised to be vigilant, keep up to date with local developments, and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately and monitor local media for up-to-date information. Irish citizens should adhere to any local security restrictions in place and should follow instructions provided by authorities.

It is strongly recommended that Irish citizens travelling to or in Sierra Leone [**register with the Embassy**](https://citizensregistration.dfa.ie/) of Ireland in Freetown.

### **Crime**

Crime levels in Sierra Leone are generally low and the greatest risk to short-term visitors is petty crime such as pick-pocketing. However burglaries can also occur, particularly around Christmas (from November until the New Year). Always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Take a number of photocopies of your passport in case your passport is lost or stolen. Leave a photocopy of passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid carrying valuables or large sums of cash in public.
* Take particular care when in large crowds or when out at night, especially in central Freetown or in the beach area, or at bars or nightclubs. Concerts and sporting events are often overcrowded and unsafe, and pickpocketing is common. Theft of personal effects during political rallies is a possibility.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations.
* Make sure your accommodation and vehicle are well secured, with locked doors and windows at all times.
* If a victim of crime while in Sierra Leone, make a report to the local police and contact the Embassy of Ireland in Freetown if you need help.

### **Corruption and Fraud**

Visitors should be aware that corruption and business fraud against foreigners is a problem. If thinking of making an investment or entering into a contract, we advise you to research the person or company concerned before making any commitments. Be particularly careful when the business opportunity is the result of unsolicited contact or promises rapid financial gain.

### **Transport**

Extreme care should be taken on the road in Sierra Leone, whether as a driver or passenger, as traffic accidents are common. Emergency medical services in Sierra Leone are limited, and poorly equipped to deal with road traffic accidents, particularly those involving complex trauma.

A major road construction and repair programme is underway across the country, with considerable improvement in major roads. However, conditions on minor roads remain generally poor, including in Freetown, and worse during the rainy season from May to October as heavy rains damage road surfaces and create large potholes. Most roads have no street lighting or painted markings and many local vehicles do not have functioning lights. A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended for minor roads outside of Freetown.

Road traffic accidents can lead to heated disputes. If caught up in a serious road traffic accident, you are advised to remain inside the vehicle, with the doors locked, until such time as the police arrive. If it becomes unsafe to remain at the scene of a road traffic accident, make your way immediately to the local police station to report the incident.

If travelling outside of Freetown, plan your journey in advance and avoid travelling on rural roads after dark. Travel in convoy where possible, to avoid getting stranded in the case of break-downs.

If you want to drive:

* Bring a full Irish driver's licence and an International Driving Permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Keep vehicle doors locked, especially when stopped in traffic.
* Remember that in Sierra Leone, vehicles drive on the right-hand side of the road.
* Makeshift roadblocks are commonly seen on rural roads, often manned by children and youths, requesting payment from travellers using the road.

Private taxis, ‘kekes’, motorbike taxis or ‘poda-podas’ (mini buses) can be hazardous as vehicle maintenance and driving standards are often very poor and vehicles overcrowded. The Embassy advises citizens not to use kekes, motorbike taxis or minibus transport in Sierra Leone, and only to use trusted taxi drivers or official drivers.

### **Border Regions**

Sierra Leone shares its border with Guinea and Liberia. If travelling near the borders, it is advisable to seek local advice and keep informed of political developments.

The longstanding dispute between Sierra Leone and Guinea over the ‘Yenga’ region in the East of Sierra Leone is an ongoing concern. Non-essential travel to the affected area should be avoided.

### **Terrorism**

The threat of terrorism in Sierra Leone is low, although there is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which can target areas frequented by foreign tourists.

### **Swimming**

Sierra Leone boasts some beautiful beaches. However, travellers should take caution when entering the ocean, as currents can be strong and beaches are not manned by lifeguards. Do not swim beyond your depth, and do not enter the water at night-time or in a state of intoxication.

Travellers should also exercise caution if considering engaging in water activities such as hire of jet skis due to the lack of official health and safety procedures or standards in place for such activities.
