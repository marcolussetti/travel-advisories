## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal ID**

You may be asked to produce valid photo ID at police checkpoints. Therefore, you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times. Store your passport in a safe place.

### **Police Reports**

The Sierra Leone Police levy a small fee (in the region of SLE 500) for all foreign nationals who need a police report. They are unable to issue crime reference numbers without a police report. You should make payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund Account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt. Do not pay the Sierra Leone Police directly. If you are reporting a crime but do not require a crime reference number or a written report, there should be no charge.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of drugs are severe; do not become involved in drugs in any way.

### **Precious Gems and Minerals**

Sierra Leone’s customs authorities enforce strict regulations about the export of precious minerals and gems such as diamonds and gold.  Anyone exporting such items should comply with Sierra Leonean law.

### **LGBTQI+**

Homosexual activity is illegal. LGBT+ couples may face harassment in public spaces; caution and discretion are advised at all times. Transgender persons may face additional discrimination or adverse treatment.

### **Religion**

The majority of the population of Sierra Leone is Muslim (60% - 70%) although there is also a sizable Christian community. There is little religious extremism in Sierra Leone and tension between religions is extremely low.

However, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend the religious beliefs of others, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if visiting religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, exercise discretion when eating, drinking or smoking in public during this time.

### **Currency**

Sierra Leone is a cash-based economy; it is advisable to bring enough cash to cover expenses while in the country. Credit cards and travellers’ cheques are rarely accepted so do not rely on them. Although there are a number of ATMs in Freetown, the security of the transactions cannot be guaranteed and cash shortages are common.

Foreign currency can be exchanged for Leones in banks or official foreign-exchange offices. Always be careful when carrying cash.

### **Language**

English is the official language of Sierra Leone and is widely spoken in Freetown. Krio, an English-based creole dialect, is the lingua franca of Sierra Leone and is widely spoken across the country.

### **Power**

Power supply remains unreliable, particularly during the dry season. Rented accommodation and hotels rely on generators and private water supplies.
