## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Personal ID**

Although not common, you may be asked to produce valid photo ID. Therefore, you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times. Store your passport in a safe place.

### **Police Reports**

The Sierra Leone Police levy a SLL 500,000/SLE 500 fee for all foreign nationals who need a police report. They are unable to issue crime reference numbers without a police report. You should make payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund Account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt. Do not pay the Sierra Leone Police directly. If reporting a crime but do not require a crime reference number or a written report, there will be no charge.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of drugs are severe; do not become involved in drugs in any way.

### **Precious gems and minerals**

Sierra Leone’s customs authorities enforce strict regulations about the export of precious minerals and gems such as diamonds and gold.  Anyone exporting such exports should comply with Sierra Leonean law.

### **LGBTQI+**

Homosexual activity is illegal. LGBT+ couples may face harassment in public spaces; caution and discretion are advised at all times. Transgender persons may face additional discrimination or adverse treatment.

### **Religion**

The majority of the population of Sierra Leone is Muslim (60% - 70%) although there is also a sizable Christian community. There is little religious extremism in Sierra Leone and tension between religions is extremely low.

However, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend the religious beliefs of others, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if visiting religious areas.

During Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, exercise discretion when eating, drinking or smoking in public during this time.
