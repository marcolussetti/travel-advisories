## Additional information

### **Entry requirements (visa/passport)**

For air travel, Irish citizens do not need a visa to visit Venezuela for periods of up to 90 days.  If you are arriving overland or by sea, you must consult your nearest Venezuelan Embassy/Consulate for advice on visa requirements. When entering the country, you may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Venezuela.

We advise you to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Venezuela and to carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay. If your passport is lost or stolen, it can take considerable time to obtain a replacement. Please take extreme care with your passport and other personal documentation.

Entry requirements change from time to time, so check these requirements with the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Venezuela.

### **Residency permits**

If you are living in Venezuela, including Margarita, the only place where you can apply for or extend your residency permit is at the [**Servicio Administrativo de Identificación, Migración y Extranjería (SAIME)**](http://www.saime.gob.ve/) headquarters in Caracas.

There have been reports of other ways of getting a residency permit, including at least one company offering residency permits for the island of Margarita, but these permits may be of dubious legality and you should avoid them.

### **Dual nationality**

Any dual national Venezuelan must use their Venezuelan identity documents to enter and leave the country.

### **Travelling with children**

Children travelling unaccompanied, with a guardian, or with one parent must provide a copy of their birth certificate and written, notarised authorization from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian specifically granting permission to travel alone, with one parent, or with a third party. This letter must include all the travel details and must be notarised by a local notary public. If the child is resident overseas, the letter must be notarised by the nearest Venezuelan Consulate/Embassy. The child should carry this letter while travelling within in the country and also when leaving Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country if they do not have this letter.

### **Health**

Check with your doctor well in advance (at least eight weeks) of travelling to see what vaccinations you need for Venezuela. Make sure you bring enough medication for your stay, bearing in mind the acute shortages of all medication in the country. Medical facilities in Venezuela vary widely in quality. More complex treatments may require evacuation to the US.

The diphtheria outbreak that began in July 2016 in Venezuela may still remain active. Passengers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks should ensure they have the necessary vaccinations in advance of travel.

Contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Mosquito-borne diseases**

Malaria is present in Venezuela so you should take medical advice on anti-malarial medication before travelling. Take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

Dengue fever is endemic to Latin America and can occur throughout the year. Take precautions against being bitten by Dengue-carrying mosquitoes, which are active throughout the day.

Yellow fever is an issue in Latin America and you may need a Yellow Fever Certificate to travel in the region.

### **Zika Virus**

There have been outbreaks in recent years of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled, filtered or bottled water during your stay.
