## Health

Check with your doctor well in advance (at least eight weeks) of travelling to see what vaccinations you need for Venezuela. Make sure you bring enough medication for your stay, bearing in mind the acute shortages of all medication in the country. Medical facilities in Venezuela vary widely in quality. More complex treatments may require evacuation to the US.

The diphtheria outbreak that began in July 2016 in Venezuela may still remain active. Passengers going to areas with diphtheria outbreaks should ensure they have the necessary vaccinations in advance of travel.

Contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Mosquito-borne Diseases**

Malaria is present in Venezuela so you should take medical advice on anti-malarial medication before travelling. Take adequate precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes by using bed nets and repellents, and wearing closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

Dengue fever is endemic to Latin America and can occur throughout the year. Take precautions against being bitten by Dengue-carrying mosquitoes, which are active throughout the day.

Yellow fever is an issue in Latin America and you may need a Yellow Fever Certificate to travel in the region.

### **Zika Virus**

There have been outbreaks in recent years of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Irish citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

### **Water**

We recommend that you drink only boiled, filtered or bottled water during your stay.
