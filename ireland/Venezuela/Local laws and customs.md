## Local laws and customs

### **Illegal drugs**

Drug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela. Donâ€™t handle illicit drugs. Arrests for drug trafficking are common and conviction leads to severe penalties, including potentially being held on remand for lengthy periods prior to sentencing, and lengthy prison sentences in harsh and dangerous conditions in Venezuelan jails. Many prisoners carry firearms and explosive devices, and violence in prisons is common.

Do not accept any offers of remuneration or hospitality in Venezuela in exchange for transporting packages in your luggage back to Ireland.

### **Taking photos**

It is illegal to take photographs of military or strategic installations including military bases, airports and the Presidential Palace. Avoid plane spotting.
