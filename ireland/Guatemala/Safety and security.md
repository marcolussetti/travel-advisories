## Safety and security

### **Hurricane Season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. Visitors should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/),or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

### **Volcanoes**

Irish citizens should check and follow the advice of local authorities before undertaking activities on volcanoes eg: climbing. Reputable government sources for information on access, restrictions and recommendations include the [**Guatemalan Meteorological Office (INSIVUMEH)**](https://insivumeh.gob.gt/) and the [**CONRED Disaster Agency**](https://conred.gob.gt/). Some volcanoes are at high altitude with sub-zero temperatures and there is no mountain rescue service. Visitors should appropriately vet any local volcano tour providers, and be ensure that they are appropriately assessing risk and providing suitable gear.

### **Crime**

Crime and violence are prevalent throughout Guatemala, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Visitors should therefore make sure to research their destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Guatemala. Some precautions - include:

* Do not carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Do not carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (as well as travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and using ATMs after dark, especially if alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in eating places, while on transportation and in other crowded areas.
* Avoid travelling alone, particularly in remote areas.

While most incidents involve local gangs, crime can be indiscriminate and can occur in tourist areas. Tourists may be directly targeted, or may be affected as a bystander or passer-by. Visitors should exercise caution when travelling in all areas of the country and avoid travelling on your own at night. Beware of scams.

There have been armed attacks on tourists travelling by road to/from major tourist sites like Antigua, Tikal, Petén and Lake Atitlan. Boat services between towns on the shore of Lake Atitlan may be a safer alternative.

Visitors should only use radio or hotel taxis. Remain vigilant and aware, including when using ATMs. Petty theft of passports and other personal belongings is common. Be particularly aware when travelling on public transport as bags left in overhead compartments can be stolen. Avoid displaying valuable items, and carry small amounts of cash.

Up to date security information is available in English through the Guatemalan Tourist Institute (INGUAT) and their PROATUR Arm who offers escort services for tourists. PROATUR can be contacted on +502 2290 2810, or by dialling 1500 in Guatemala.

PROATUR issues advice on which routes to take when travelling in and around Sololá, Panajachel and Lake Atitlan. Avoid the Godinez by-pass via Patzun between Guatemala City and Panajachel. Use the Pan American Highway to Sololá instead. Visitors should also avoid the road between Cocales (Suchitepequez) and San Lucas Toliman (Atitlan) if possible.

### **Road Travel**

For security reasons visitors should avoid travel on public buses, giving preference to private coach services which are generally safer. Visitors should prioritise travelling during the day on main roads.

Visitors should drive carefully and with caution. Adequate car insurance is essential. If involved in an accident, contact the National Police by calling 120 or the fire brigade by dialling 122 or 123 and wait for them to arrive.

PROVIAL, a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major roads in the country. However, patrols are sporadic. PROVIAL can be contacted by calling 2419-2121.

It is generally safer to travel on main roads. There is a greater risk of attack on quieter routes. Travel in convoy if possible. In more isolated locations, roads are unpaved and a four-wheel drive vehicle may be needed.

### **Border Areas**

There have been numerous reports of customs/immigration officials charging an “entry fee”. This is illegal. By asking for an official receipt for money you may find that the “fee” is dropped.

Pay attention to your security in the border areas with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize. There have been recent reports of disruptions and violence at the Mexico-Guatemala border, particularly in the Chiapas and Huehuetenango zones. Care should also be taken in the Belize/Guatemala border area because of the ongoing dispute between the two countries.
