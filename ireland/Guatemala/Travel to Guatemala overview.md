## Travel to Guatemala overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Guatemala. Visitors should note that Guatemala is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.

A valid passport is required for travel to Guatemala. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

We advise a high degree of caution while crossing Guatemala’s land borders. Disruption and closures are common, so you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross. Passengers should avoid crossing at night, and take extra care at walking border crossings.

Crime and violence are prevalent throughout Guatemala, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Visitors should therefore make sure to research their destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Guatemala.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Mexico on social media (X@[**IrishEmbMexico**](https://x.com/IrishEmbMexico/status/1585702058497232896/photo/3) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Up to date security information is available in English through the [**Guatemalan Tourist Institute (INGUAT)**](https://isto.international/isto_members/instituto-guatemalteco-de-turismo-inguat/) and their PROATUR Arm who offers escort services for tourists. PROATUR can also provide guidance to tourists who experience difficulties when travelling, or are the victim of a crime. PROATUR can be contacted on +502 2290 2810, or by dialling 1500 in Guatemala.

PROVIAL, a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major roads in the country. However, patrols are sporadic. PROVIAL can be contacted by calling 2419-2121.

Visitors may also call:

* Police: 120
* Fire brigade and Ambulance: 122 or 123
