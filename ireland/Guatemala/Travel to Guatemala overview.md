## Travel to Guatemala overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

**On 18 January 2026, the Guatemalan government declared a 30‑day nationwide State of Emergency (sometimes translated as ‘State of Siege’). The State of Emergency is in response to escalating insecurity linked to organised crime and gang activity, including recent attacks on law enforcement and prison riots. Irish citizens should exercise heightened caution. Under the measure, authorities may militarise certain areas, restrict civil liberties such as freedom of movement and assembly, and carry out arrests or home searches without warrants. Some public services may also be disrupted. Irish citizens should follow guidance of local authorities, and monitor local media for any new information.**

On 14 December 2025, the Guatemalan government declared a State of Emergency in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Sololá in western Guatemala. The State of Emergency is a response to increased criminal activity in the two municipalities, and it is expected to last for at least 15 days. Irish citizens travelling in those municipalities, and surrounding areas, should exercise additional caution, avoid large crowds/demonstrations, follow instructions issued by local authorities, and monitor local media for any new information.

Recently, Guatemala has been subject to earthquakes of varying severity, from 3.0 to 5.7 magnitude. Earthquakes and their aftershocks can also cause landslides in some parts of the country. If travelling through Guatemala, please make sure you know what to do in case of an earthquake. Earthquakes may also cause road blockages and temporary disruptions.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Guatemala. Visitors should note that Guatemala is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4) signed between Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Upon arriving in any of the CA-4 countries, visitors may travel to the other three member states, and stay for up to 90 days within the CA-4 region, without undergoing any entry and exit formalities. This period begins at the first point of entry in to any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, though a request for a 30-day extension can be made before the 90 days limit expires.

A valid passport is required for travel to Guatemala. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

We advise a high degree of caution while crossing Guatemala’s land borders. Disruption and closures are common, so you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross. Passengers should avoid crossing at night, and take extra care at walking border crossings.

Crime and violence are prevalent throughout Guatemala, and the security situation poses a risk for foreigners. Visitors should therefore make sure to research their destination thoroughly, and take all the necessary precautions in all parts of Guatemala.

Citizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Mexico on social media (X@[**IrishEmbMexico**](https://x.com/IrishEmbMexico/status/1585702058497232896/photo/3) and [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/IrishEmbMexico)) to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.

### **Emergency Assistance**

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.

Up to date security information is available in English through the [**Guatemalan Tourist Institute (INGUAT)**](https://isto.international/isto_members/instituto-guatemalteco-de-turismo-inguat/) and their PROATUR Arm who offers escort services for tourists.
