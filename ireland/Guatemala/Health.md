### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see if any vaccinations are required and consult them on any other health related concerns.

Guatemalan medical service providers can be reluctant to offer care/treatment if visitors cannot prove they have comprehensive medical insurance. It is therefore essential to carry evidence of insurance cover at all times. In the event that medical care is required, please contact your insurance provider as a matter of urgency. Make sure to get confirmation from the hospital administration that your insurance coverage is accepted, as some hospitals may ask for payment upfront and you may have to claim on your insurance later.

### **Zika Virus**

There may be a risk of Zika virus in Guatemala. Irish Citizens especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)**](https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/zika/).

### **Dengue fever**

Dengue fever , a mosquito-borne illness, is common in Guatemala. Visitors to the country are advised to take appropriate precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using insect repellents, covering up and using mosquito nets, and to seek early medical advice if they experience symptoms of the virus.
