## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Carry Photo ID at all times.

Do not get involved with drugs of any kind in any way. Penalties for drug offences are severe, and convictions carry very long sentences â€“ of 8-15 years.

Public displays of affection by same-sex couples may draw unwanted attention, particularly outside of the capital, and travellers should exercise caution in this regard.
