## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **LGBTQI+ Travellers**

Kiribati law criminalizes same-sex relations. If you are convicted, you could face imprisonment, though enforcement of the law is rare.

### **Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**

Accessibility of buildings, and communications and information for persons with disabilities is not mandated. There are no special accommodations for persons with disabilities.

### **Currency**

The Australian dollar is the currency used in Kiribati. Major currencies can be exchanged at the ANZ Bank, and some hotels and shops. The ANZ bank is the only commercial bank in Kiribati. Be prepared to pay cash for hotel bills and all other services, as credit card services are not available except for in the capital South Tarawa (only where EFTPOS and ATM are available).

### **General**

Local laws forbid nudity and revealing swimming costumes. Kiribati operates a strict quarantine regime for the import of food, plants and animal (including fish) products. Some local handicrafts (including straw products and shells) may be subject to strict Australian or New Zealand import regulations. You should get a phyto-sanitary certificate in Kiribati, but items may nevertheless be confiscated.

### **Language**

The main language is I-Kiribati – however English has been taught over many years and is widely understood.
