## Health

We advise you to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel with provision for medical evacuation.

### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country.

### **Medical Facilities**

Medical facilities at the general hospital in Tarawa are modest. Elsewhere, clinics are generally staffed by nurse practitioners. Pharmaceuticals and prescription medicines are generally not available. You should bring any medicines you need for existing medical conditions with you. For more serious or complicated problems medical evacuation may be required.

### **Water**

You should boil all drinking water or drink bottled water while in Kiribati. Avoid eating local shellfish or lagoon fish on Tarawa.

### **Dengue Fever**

Dengue fever occurs in Kiribati. Travellers are advised to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and stay in lodgings where there are mosquito screens on windows and doors.

### **Health Risk**

There have been reports of visitors being bitten by stray dogs. Be vigilant, particularly on the beach. If you are approached by a dog, do not run. Reaching down as if to pick up something off the ground can be enough to scare dogs away. If you are bitten seek medical attention immediately.
