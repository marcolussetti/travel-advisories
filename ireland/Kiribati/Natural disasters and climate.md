## Natural disasters and climate

### **Weather**

The wet season runs from November to April, during which strong winds and sea swells can occur. As Kiribati is close to the equator, it does not usually experience tropical cyclones.

You should monitor regional and international weather updates from the [**World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)**](http://severe.worldweather.org/), the [**Fiji Meteorological Service website**](http://www.met.gov.fj/), and local newspapers.

Kiribati is subject to periodic spells of drought. These can be severe, and water restrictions may be put in place.
