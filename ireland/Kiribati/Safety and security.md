## Safety and security

### **Petty crime**

Crime in Kiribati is low but petty crime can occur.

We advise you to take basic precautions while travelling to Kiribati:

* Don’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.
* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you are alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.
* Keep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.

### **Road Travel**

An [**International Driving Permit**](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/international-driving-permit/) may be required for car rental. Residents should obtain a Kiribati driving licence.

Road travel in Kiribati can be dangerous. Roads are often poorly maintained and unlit.

### **Inter-island travel**

Some restrictions remain on inter-island travel, particularly on COVID-19 free islands where availability of quarantine centres is a factor.

### **Airports**

There are two international airports in Kiribati - **Bonriki International Airport** located at Bonriki on South Tarawa of the Gilberts Islands Group; and **Cassidy International Airport** located at Cassidy on Kiritimati Island of the Line Islands Group.

### **Telephone and Internet**

The country code for Kiribati is 686. Internet service is available in Kiribati, mainly on Tarawa and Kiritimati Island. On the outer islands, internet access is limited. On Kiribati and some outer islands, the 2G and 4G network work.

### **Swimming**

Do not swim in the lagoon in south Tarawa as it is highly polluted.

Take great care when swimming in the sea around Kiribati, as there are very strong rip tides along coast and reef areas.

Visitors should wear safety equipment at all times during boating trips. Squalls can occur at very short notice.

### **Weather**

The wet season runs from November to April, during which strong winds and sea swells can occur. As Kiribati is close to the equator, it does not usually experience tropical cyclones.

You should monitor regional and international weather updates from the [**World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)**](http://severe.worldweather.org/), the [**Fiji Meteorological Service website**](http://www.met.gov.fj/), and local newspapers.

Kiribati is subject to periodic spells of drought. These can be severe, and water restrictions may be put in place.

### **Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**

Accessibility of buildings, and communications and information for persons with disabilities is not mandated. There are no special accommodations for persons with disabilities.
