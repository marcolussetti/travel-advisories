## Entry Requirements

Irish citizens may travel to Zambia for the purpose of tourism and/or visiting friends/relatives for up to 90 days in any period of 12 months. They will receive a passport entry stamp with a specified period of stay upon arrival (generally 30 days renewable) and there is no associated fee.

However, any Irish citizen whose allowed period of stay (as specified in the passport) has expired, and who wishes to extend the stay [within the limit of 90 days], should call at the nearest Immigration Office to extend the period of the visit. The extension must be sought before the allowed period of stay (as specified in passport) has passed. If the visitor wishes to remain in Zambia beyond the 90 days, they should apply for a Visiting Permit. Failure to obtain necessary extension can result in substantial fine when departing Zambia.

Further details regarding other types of visas are available online from the Zambian Department of Immigration. Irish citizens are advised to confirm all visa requirements with the Zambia High Commission in London as visa requirements may be subject to change.

Legal residents of Ireland who intend to travel with non-passport travel documents are required to obtain visa before visiting Zambia. Visa may be obtained online through the Zambia Department of Immigration.

Visas may be extended at the discretion of the immigration department up to a maximum of 90 days. Do not overstay your visa as you risk a court appearance, imprisonment, fine and/or deportation.

### **Passport**

Irish passports should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date of arrival and have at least 2 blank pages.

It is advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport when travelling to Zambia and to also carry a photocopy of your passport at all times while travelling.

If your passport is lost or stolen while in Zambia, contact the Irish Embassy in Lusaka. We can issue an emergency travel document to get you home.

We will do our best to help as quickly as possible but this can take some time. Your location and circumstances may limit the help we can give you. We will not provide a travel document without a police report.

### **Journalists**

Visitors wishing to bring in specialist/professional video recording equipment must apply for press accreditation to film in Zambia. Temporary clearance must be obtained for camera equipment from the Zambia News and Information Department. It is prudent to advise the Embassy of your arrival and departure dates with a minimum of three weeks’ notice prior to the date of arrival. Visitors without the proper documentation and clearance, may have equipment confiscated on arrival.
