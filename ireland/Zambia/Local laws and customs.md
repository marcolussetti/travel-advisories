## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to conservative local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

### **Prescription Medication**

There have been reports of tourists being detained for possession of prescription medication, without the doctor prescription. If you require medication travel with sufficient supply for your stay, and be sure to retain and carry the appropriate documentation.

### **Illegal drugs**

The possession, smuggling and/or use of narcotics, including marijuana, is strictly prohibited in Zambia and can result in severe punishments. Possession of even small quantities may result in sentences up to five years in prisons where conditions are very poor.

### **Pornography**

Possessing pornography is illegal in Zambia.

### LGBTI+

Homosexuality is illegal in Zambia and can result in long prison sentences. Caution and discretion are advised at all times.

### **Photography**

Be careful of photographing sites deemed sensitive by the authorities, such as power stations, army barracks, government buildings, river junctions and airports. It is better to err on the side of caution and not take the photographs.

### **National Parks**

Visitors to Zambia’s National Parks should be aware of recent arrests of visitors who removed items from the park such as, for example, a piece of animal bone.  Please respect local laws and do not remove any items from national parks.
