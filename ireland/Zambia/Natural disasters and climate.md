## Natural disasters and climate

### **Climate**

December to April in Zambia is hot and wet with often torrential downpours. May to August is dry and fairly cool. September to November is dry but progressively hotter.

Additional care is advised if driving during the rainy season (November to April) as roads and bridges can be washed away.
