## Travel to Zambia overview

### **Security Status**

High Degree of Caution

### **Travel Alert**

#### **Kafue River Pollution**

In February 2025, a large amount of toxic waste, including heavy metals, was released into the Mwambashi stream in the Copperbelt Province when a tailing dam collapsed at a local leach mine. The Mwambashi stream flows into the Kafue river which is a major water source for the region and country. This incident has posed a serious health risk for the surrounding area, potentially affecting local ground water sources. A fishing ban has been put in place on the Kafue river in the Central and Copperbelt Provinces.

Citizens should be aware of these health hazards if travelling in the region and are advised to avoid the immediate area where the incident took place, and water sources in the wider surrounding area, as well as avoiding the consumption of fish potentially sourced from the region. Note boiling water does not remove heavy metals.

### **General Travel Advice**

As with all international travel, Irish citizens are encouraged to [**register**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/citizens-registration/) their details and travel plans with the Embassy when visiting Zambia, and to share these details with family and friends in advance of traveling.

Irish citizens may travel to Zambia for the purpose of tourism and/or visiting friends/relatives for up to 90 days in any period of 12 months. They will receive a passport entry stamp with a specified period of stay upon arrival (generally 30 days, which can be renewed up to the 90 day limit) and there is no associated fee.

Further details regarding other types of visas are available online from the Zambian Department of Immigration. Irish citizens are advised to confirm all visa requirements with the Zambia High Commission in London as visa requirements may be subject to change.

A valid passport is required for travel to Zambia. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of six months from the date of arrival and have at least three blank pages. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, including requirements for those who plan to stay longer than 30 days, please see the Entry requirements tab.
