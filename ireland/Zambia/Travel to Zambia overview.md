The southern Africa region experienced severe drought in 2024 and many States announced national emergencies, including Zambia. Travellers should be aware that this may pose additional unforeseen difficulties and should note that many areas may still experience power shortages as a result.

#### **Kafue River Pollution**

In February 2025, a large amount of toxic wastewater, including heavy metals, was released into the Mwambashi stream in the Copperbelt Province when a tailing dam collapsed at a local leach mine. The Mwambashi stream flows into the Kafue river which is a major waterway for the region.

A fishing ban has been put in place on the Kafue river in the Central and Copperbelt Provinces.

Note boiling water does not remove heavy metals.
