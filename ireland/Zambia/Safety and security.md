## Safety and security

### **Social unrest**

Avoid any political rallies, demonstrations or large gatherings. There are occasional student demonstrations at the University of Zambia on the Great East Road (which is the main road to the airport). Keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Terrorism**

Although the threat from terrorism in Zambia is low, there is still a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Regional Risks**

There is a risk of landmines near Zambia’s borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique, and on the Angolan side of the Zambia-Angola border. Do not stray off main routes, particularly in rural areas, and always check with local contact or tour operators before travelling to affected regions.

There is also a risk of inadvertently illegally entering DRC, due to lack of border demarcation, and unrest and/or violence near the border with DRC.

### **Crime**

Pick pocketing and petty theft is not uncommon particularly at some restaurants and internet cafes near the bus and train stations in Lusaka and Livingstone. Always take sensible precautions:

* Do not carry your credit cards, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place
* Visitors must always travel with proof of ID. It is advisable to carry a certified copy of your passport with you at all times which can be used as proof of ID, and to leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and do not use ATMs after dark, especially if alone and check no one has followed you.
* Only use reputable banks or bureaux de change to exchange money or use ATMs as counterfeit notes are in circulation
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible. Avoid walking after dark particularly in downtown areas
* Keep a close eye on personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations
* Do not leave valuables in unattended vehicles and keep vehicles centrally locked when driving in city centres
* Be aware a high proportion of the civil population have access to firearms
* Security risks increase when it is dark, especially in city centres. Keep valuables and originals of important documents in safe places.

### **Reporting crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Zambia, report it to the local police immediately. Contact us at the Irish Embassy in Lusaka if you need help.

We advise all Irish citizens resident in Zambia to continue to take the usual precautions at their homes, in vehicles and when walking in public. Please remain vigilant and contact the Police or the Embassy if you have any concerns.

### **Prescription Medication**

There have been reports of tourists being detained for possession of prescription medication, without a doctor's prescription. If you require medication travel with sufficient supply for your stay, be sure to retain and carry the appropriate documentation.

### **Road Safety**

Road accidents are the major cause of fatalities in Zambia. Driving in urban areas during the day is relatively safe, but driving at night outside of main towns should be avoided where possible. Hazards poorly maintained vehicles, poor road conditions, pedestrians walking on the road without reflective clothing, stray animals and tired, distracted or drunk drivers.

Extra care is advised during the rainy season (November to April) as roads and bridges can be washed away, and as rainfall can be sudden and significant enough to reduce visibility substantially.

If driving, be vigilant, keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed, and be aware of your surroundings, especially if driving after dark.

### **Practical advice:**

* Bring a full Irish driving licence and an international driving permit and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught
* Keep vehicle doors locked, as there are occasional incidents of armed or opportunistic robberies as well as vehicle hijackings, particularly when stopped at traffic lights.
* Do not leave valuables visible when parking your car
* It is an offence to use a mobile phone while driving

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).

### **Public transport**

Caution should be exercised if considering the use of public transport, the safety standards of the vehicle and driving may be lead to unnecessary risk, especially on long journeys.

Minibuses in urban areas are usually severely overcrowded and badly driven.

A number of taxi hailing apps are in operation in Lusaka and other main population centres.

### **Wild animals**

Wild animals, including poisonous snakes, are a constant threat to travellers and residents in Zambia. There have been a number of recent tourist injuries and deaths related to wild animal incidents. In response the Zambian Ministry for Tourism has assured potential visitors of national park safety but has warned tourists to adhere to necessary safety measures and park rules and regulations. Always follow local regulations and follow your safari rangers’ instructions.

Be aware that rabies and anthrax are present in Zambia so it is advised to avoid physical contact with animals and animal corpses.

### **Adventure sports**

There are many adventure sport operators in Victoria Falls and serious accidents and deaths occasionally occur. Ensure you use a reputable operator. Check that your travel insurance will cover you in the event of death or injury to yourself or a third party.
