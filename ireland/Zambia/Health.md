Please note that while Embassy can provide information on local medical supports we cannot provide medical advice or pay for medical bills.

Before travelling, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade **strongly recommends** getting comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. Check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers all activities you want to undertake.

Medical facilities in Zambia are less developed than in Ireland, especially in rural areas.  Even basic drugs and clean needles may not be available. Take particular care if travelling with children.

Only drink or use boiled or bottled water. If you suffer from severe diarrhoea during a visit to Zambia, get immediate medical attention.
