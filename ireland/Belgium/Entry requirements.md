## Entry requirements

### Passport

Irish citizens require a passport or passport card to enter Belgium. While there is no minimum passport validity requirement, your passport or passport card must be valid for the duration of your stay.

### **Damaged Passport**

Under no circumstances should you travel to Belgium using a passport that is damaged in any way (e.g. torn cover or visa pages, cracks on the identity page). The Embassy is aware of a number of cases of citizens being detained by Border Authorities for travelling using a damaged passport. If your passport is damaged, replace it via [**Passport Online**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) prior to travel.

### **Lost or Stolen Passport**

Please keep in mind emergency travel documents cannot be issued outside of office hours except in cases of a genuine emergency. Citizens may need to arrange new flights and accommodation to allow time to obtain a travel document on the next working day.

Detailed guidance on what to do if your [**passport is lost/stolen**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/lost-stolen-passport/) is available on our website.

Please note that once a passport is reported lost or stolen it cannot be used for travel, even if found. Travelling on a passport that has previously been reported lost or stolen may result in being detained and the seizure of your passport.

### **Staying for Longer than Three Months**

All EU citizens (including Irish citizens) who want to stay in Belgium for more than three months must register with the Belgian authorities to obtain a residence card.
