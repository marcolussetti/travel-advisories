## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or even illegal.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Illegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.

### **Photo Identification**

Under Belgian law, you must carry state-issued photo ID at all times. This law applies to both residents and non-residents. Failure to produce appropriate identification when requested by Police is viewed as a serious matter by Belgian authorities and can result in being detained until your identity and nationality is confirmed.

For Irish citizens, acceptable forms of state-issued photo ID include an Irish passport or Passport Card. To avoid the inconvenience, and risk of loss/theft of your Irish passport book, we advise our citizens to obtain a Passport Card, which can be easily carried in your wallet or purse. Please find further information on how to apply for a Passport Card on the [Passport Service website](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-card/). The Irish Public Services Card is generally not an acceptable form of identification to Belgian authorities. Irish citizens residing in Belgium must carry their residence permit at all times.

### **Travelling with Children**

While there are no laws prohibiting the travel of a minor with only one parent or guardian, it should be noted that border control authorities pay particular attention to minors travelling under these circumstances. To avoid difficulties, we suggest that the accompanying parent carry a copy of the minor's birth certificate, a signed permission letter and passport/ID for the non-accompanying parent.
