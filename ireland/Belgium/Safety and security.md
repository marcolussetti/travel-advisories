## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

There is a global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, including in Belgium, which could be against civilian targets, including locations frequented by tourists.

Following a shooting incident in Brussels in October 2023 that resulted in a number of fatalities, the Belgian Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis raised the general threat level for Belgium from Level 2 to Level 3 (of 4). This means that the risk of an attack is viewed as “serious”.

In March 2016, terrorist attacks occurred at Brussels Airport and the city’s metro system. A number of incidents attributed to terrorism have occurred in the years that followed.

If in Belgium, you should expect to see additional security measures and an increased police presence in public places. We advise all citizens to maintain an awareness of their surroundings, monitor local media for up-to-date information, and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### **Petty Theft**

As with any country, crimes such as mugging, bag-snatching and pickpocketing are not uncommon in Belgian cities and towns. Always keep a close eye on your personal belongings and be vigilant at major railway stations, on the metro, buses and trams.

We advise Irish citizens to be **particularly vigilant** of belongings following a noticeable increase in reports of theft in the following areas.

* Brussels South Station (Gare du Midi/Zuidstation), which is the Eurostar terminal and the terminus for buses from Charleroi Airport
* On board international trains (particularly the Brussels – Amsterdam route)
* European Quarter/Schuman area of Brussels (particularly in bars and cafes near Schuman Roundabout. Place Jourdan, and in the vicinity of the European Parliament)

We also advise to exercise caution in the following areas:

* Brussels North & Central Station
* On board the Brussels Metro
* Buses and trains serving Brussels Zaventem Airport
* Areas with a large density of tourists, such as the Grand Place in Brussels and surrounding areas.
* Public Squares in popular tourist destinations, such as Ghent and Bruges

### **Organised Crime**

There have been a number of recent incidents of violent crime in Belgium, which have included shootings, stabbings and the use of explosive devices, such as grenades. Authorities have attributed these to criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking. These incidents have mainly occurred in Antwerp and Brussels.

It is advisable to remain vigilant and any suspicions as regards illegal activity should be reported to [**police authorities**](https://www.police.be/en).

### **Public Gatherings**

Marches and demonstrations are common, particularly in Brussels, and often result in confrontation between demonstrators and police that sometimes turn violent. We recommend, avoiding areas where large-scale demonstrations are taking place.

Always keep informed of what is going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.

### **Reporting Crime**

If a victim of a crime while in Belgium, report it to the local police immediately. Contact the Irish Embassy in Brussels if assistance is required.

### **Driving**

If you want to drive in Belgium:

* Bring a full Irish driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware that on-the-spot fines can be incurred for motoring offences. If unable to pay the fine, your vehicle may be impounded.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* Be aware of low emissions zones prohibiting certain types of vehicles from specific urban areas. Further information is available on the Urban Access Regulations [**website**](https://www.urbanaccessregulations.eu/) where you can search by city.

### **Pedestrians**

Pedestrians should be aware that ‘the green man’ signal does not mean that cars will automatically stop. Many of the zebra crossings are not accompanied by light systems. The custom is that the motorist should stop to allow any pedestrian cross at the zebra crossing as and when they choose to use the zebra crossing. Be careful in all cases and at all times as some motorists will be more vigilant than others.
