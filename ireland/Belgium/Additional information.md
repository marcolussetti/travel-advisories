## Additional information

### **Entry requirements**

Irish citizens require a passport or passport card to enter Belgium. While there is no minimum passport validity requirement, your passport or passport card must be valid for the duration of your stay.

### **Damaged Passports**

Under no circumstances should you travel to Belgium using a passport that is damaged in any way (e.g. torn cover or visa pages, cracks on the identity page). The Embassy is aware of a number of cases of citizens being detained by Border Authorities for travelling using a damaged passport. If your passport is damaged, replace it via [**Passport Online**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/passport-online/) prior to travel.

### **Lost /Stolen Passport**

Please keep in mind emergency travel documents cannot be issued outside of office hours except in cases of a genuine emergency. Citizens may need to arrange new flights and accommodation to allow time to obtain a travel document on the next working day.

Detailed guidance on what to do if your [**passport is lost/stolen**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/overseas-travel/assistance-abroad/lost-stolen-passport/) is available on our website.

Please note that once a passport is reported lost or stolen it cannot be used for travel, even if found. Travelling on a passport that has previously been reported lost or stolen may result in being detained and the seizure of your passport.

### **Staying for longer than three months**

All EU citizens (including Irish citizens) who want to stay in Belgium for more than three months must register with the Belgian authorities to obtain a residence card.

### **Driving**

If you want to drive in Belgium:

* Bring a full Irish driving license and make sure to have adequate and appropriate insurance.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught.
* Be aware that on-the-spot fines can be incurred for motoring offences. If unable to pay the fine, your vehicle may be impounded.
* Keep vehicle doors locked and bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if stopped at traffic lights.
* Be aware of low emissions zones prohibiting certain types of vehicles from specific urban areas. Further information is available on the Urban Access Regulations [**website**](https://www.urbanaccessregulations.eu/) where you can search by city.

### **Pedestrians**

Pedestrians should be aware that ‘the green man’ signal does not mean that cars will automatically stop. Many of the zebra crossings are not accompanied by light systems. The custom is that the motorist should stop to allow any pedestrian cross at the zebra crossing as and when they choose to use the zebra crossing. Be careful in all cases and at all times as some motorists will be more vigilant than others.
