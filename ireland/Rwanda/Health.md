### **Ebola**

On 17 July 2019, WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This reflects the possible increased national and regional risks of the current epidemic. As a neighbouring country, Rwanda is considered at risk. The Government of Rwanda is prepared and continues to monitor the situation. There are currently no restrictions on travel across borders. Please stay informed. The latest updates can be found on the [**World Health Organisation's**](http://www.who.int/) website.

### **Travel Insurance**

Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake.

### **Vaccinations**

Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre.

### **Medical Services**

Medical help at the scene of an accident is also likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Adequate insurance can be crucial in helping people get the medical attention required.

### **Medication**

Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
