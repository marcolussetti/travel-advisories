## Additional information

### **Entry requirements - (visa/passport)**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Rwanda.

Irish citizens travelling to Rwanda can apply for an eVisa [**online**](https://www.visagov.com/en/rwa-visa-for-rwanda). Passengers can also acquire a 30 day entry visa upon arrival.

Passports should be valid for at least 6 months from the date of entry into Rwanda. You will need one blank page on your passport for entry stamps. It’s advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you when travelling to Rwanda and you should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times during your stay.

### **Yellow fever certificates**

You may be asked for your yellow fever vaccination certificate when you are checking in for your flight to Rwanda and/or on arrival at Kigali International Airport.

### **Health**

On 17 July 2019, WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This reflects the possible increased national and regional risks of the current epidemic. As a neighbouring country, Rwanda is considered at risk. The Government of Rwanda is prepared and continues to monitor the situation. There are currently no restrictions on travel across borders.  Please stay informed. The latest updates can be found on the [**World Health Organisation's**](http://www.who.int/) website. Before travelling, the Department strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical repatriation/evacuation, repatriation of remains and legal costs. You should check any exclusions and, in particular, that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake. Check what vaccinations you may need for your trip at least eight weeks before you travel. We cannot advise you on vaccinations, but you can get information about vaccinations from your local GP or an International Health and Travel Centre. Quality medical care services are limited, especially outside Kigali and other major urban centres. Medical help at the scene of an accident is also likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. Adequate insurance can be crucial in helping people get the medical attention required. Make sure you bring enough medication for your entire trip and for any unexpected delays. You may wish to also bring copies of your prescription in case you lose your medication.
