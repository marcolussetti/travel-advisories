## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Rwanda, consular assistance is provided via the [**Embassy of Ireland in Kampala, Uganda**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/uganda/kampala/).

Please note that if you are an Irish citizen and require urgent assistance while the Embassy is closed, contact the main Embassy number, +256 417 713 000, and leave a message on the Duty Officer voice mailbox. This mailbox will be monitored regularly.

Monday to Thursday 10:00-12:00 and 14:00-16:00
