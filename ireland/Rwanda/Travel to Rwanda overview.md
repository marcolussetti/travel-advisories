Risks associated with increased fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Rwandan side of the border, due to the closeness of the fighting. On 27 January, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire in Gisenyi.

The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma and Cyangugu/Bukavu could close at short notice.

### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Rwanda.

A valid passport is required for travel to Rwanda Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

For more information on visas and passports, please see the Entry requirements tab.

Visitors to Rwanda are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains volatile, and the situation in Burundi has also become volatile with increased tensions and violence related to the ongoing political crisis. There is risk that the security situation in the region could continue to deteriorate rapidly. You should remain alert to the possibility of military incursions, stray bullets and/or artillery fire entering Rwanda if you are near the DRC border.

Rwanda is generally safe and crime levels are relatively low. However, there have been reports of burglary, theft and mugging in Kigali. You should take precautions with valuables and remain vigilant.
