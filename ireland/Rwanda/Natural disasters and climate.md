## Natural disasters and climate

### **Rainy seasons**

During the two rainy seasons (February to May and September to December), Rwanda frequently experiences intense thunderstorms. Landslides and floods are also common during these seasons. If you’re travelling to or living in Rwanda, monitor regional weather forecasts and always follow local authorities’ instructions about security and evacuation.

### **Earthquakes**

The last recorded earthquakes in Bukavu (eastern DRC) and Cyangugu in south-west Rwanda were in 2008. Both caused a number of fatalities. If you’re travelling to Rwanda, make sure you find out from local contacts or your hotel what you should do in the event of an earthquake.
