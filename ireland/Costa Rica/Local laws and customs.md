## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.

Do not get involved with drugs of any kind in any way. Penalties for drug offences are severe in Costa Rica, with convictions for drug possession or trafficking carrying very long sentences.
