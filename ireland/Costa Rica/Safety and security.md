## Safety and security

### **General Security**

Visitors should remain vigilant and aware, including when using ATMs. Petty theft of passports and other personal belongings is common. Visitors should be particularly aware when on the beach, particularly in remote or poorly lit areas, and when travelling on public transport as bags left in overhead compartments can be stolen.

Only use official taxis and avoid poorly lit or remote areas.

Exercise caution when purchasing spirit-based drinks as there have been a number of cases of serious illness or death caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol. If travellers shows symptoms of alcohol-induced methanol poisoning (including headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting), seek medical attention immediately. Tourists should not leave drinks unattended, and women travelling alone should exercise increased vigilance.

Travellers should be aware that some beaches have strong currents/riptides, while many beaches do not have lifeguards. Visitors should also be aware that crocodiles have been sighted in beaches along the Pacific coast, with some attacks in recent years. Always consult with locals before swimming.

### **Hurricane Season**

The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from July to October. Visitors should pay close attention to local and international weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Always monitor local and international weather updates for the region by accessing, for example, [**the Weather Channel**](http://www.weather.com/), or the [**US National Hurricane Centre website**](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).
