## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Costa Rica, we are limited in the help we can offer in an emergency. However, if visitors need assistance, please contact the [**Irish Embassy in Mexico City.**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/mexico/mexicocity/)

The Embassy operates an out of hours service for Irish citizens requiring emergency assistance on weekends and public holidays.

If in need of emergency assistance during these times, leave a message by calling +52 55 5520 5803.

Monday to Friday 08:30 to 17:00
