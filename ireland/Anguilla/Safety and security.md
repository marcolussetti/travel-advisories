## Safety and security

### **Terrorism**

While the threat from terrorism is minimal, it is important not to rule out the risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by tourists and expatriates.

### **Crime**

Crime remains relatively low but you should take sensible precautions:

* Don’t carry your passport unless absolutely necessary and leave a copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) with family or friends at home.
* Avoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark.
* Avoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.
* Lock doors and windows at night.

### **Reporting crime**

If you’re a victim of a crime, report it to the local police immediately. And you can contact us at the [**Irish Embassy in Washington DC**](/en/usa/washington/contact/) if you need help.

### **Driving**

If you’re planning to drive in Anguilla, be careful and take these simple precautions:

* Bring your full Irish and international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance
* Keep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights

### **Hiring a vehicle**

If you’re hiring a vehicle, do not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.
