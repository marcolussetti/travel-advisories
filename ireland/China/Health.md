## Health

### **Vaccinations**

Check with a doctor well in advance of travelling to see what vaccinations may be needed for China.

Any Irish citizen considering travel should be aware that mRNA vaccines are not available in China.

### **Infectious Diseases**

To restrict the spread of infectious diseases, China implements quarantine and monitoring measures at ports of entry. People arriving to China may be tested for infectious diseases and may be required to undergo medical treatment directly or advised to seek medical treatment.

### **Medical Facilities**

We advise all Irish citizens already in China or those visiting China to take the time to identify what medical facilities are available in their location. Irish citizens considering travel to China should be aware that health and medical care standards vary from place to place. If you become ill or have an accident, it may be difficult to secure adequate treatment, particularly in remote areas.

### **Covid-19**

Information on COVID-19, including advice for the public on protective steps, is available on the website of the [**World Health Organisation**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and on the [**HSE website**](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/).

### **Air Quality**

Many cities and areas in China can experience high levels of air pollution. We advise all Irish visitors and residents to monitor the updates and advisories from the [**Air Quality Health Index**](http://www.aqhi.gov.hk/en.html).

### **Other Health Precautions**

As a precaution, avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds; and ensure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.

The [**World Health Organisation (WHO)**](https://www.who.int/) has up to date information on their website.
