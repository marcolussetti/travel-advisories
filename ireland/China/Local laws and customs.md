## Local laws and customs

Remember, local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal. We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws.

### **Registration**

Foreigners must register with the local Public Security Bureau (police station) **within 24 hours** of arrival in China. If staying in a hotel or hostel, they will carry out this procedure on your behalf. If staying with friends or family, you must register personally.

### **Arrest or Detention**

If arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, the Consulate General in Shanghai, or the Consulate General in Hong Kong immediately.

Please note that if temporarily detained and issued with a fine, you must pay the fine within the specified period. If the fine is not paid in time, you may be placed in a detention centre. We recommend to contact the Embassy or Consulate General immediately for assistance if you have been temporarily detained or fined. The Chinese judicial system can be difficult to navigate if you do not speak fluent Chinese. The Embassy or Consulate General can assist in dealing with the authorities and provide you with information on where to find an English-speaking lawyer.

Visitors who do not have a valid visa or have overstayed their visa may be fined, detained and/or deported by the Chinese authorities. Please note that there is an average of 30 days processing time for visa overstay fines, which may be prolonged to 60 days. The Irish Embassy in China cannot influence or speed up this processing time. An overstay will prove very costly, as a person in this position will need to have sufficient money to support and accommodate themselves during this processing time.

Please note that in order to work in China you possess a valid Z-visa **and** a valid work permit. Visitors may be detained or fined if they do not have both documents.

### **Commercial and Civil Disputes**

If suspected of a crime, or involved in a personal or business dispute, the authorities may confiscate your passport, to prevent you from leaving the country or the particular region until the matter is resolved. If your passport is withheld for any reason by the Chinese authorities, please inform the Embassy or Consulate General.

In the case of disputes involving commercial law, a local lawyer should be engaged as a matter of priority. The Embassy cannot intervene in commercial disputes.

### **Illegal Drugs**

Use or possession of illegal drugs (no matter what the drug) carry stiff penalties, including fines, deportation, long prison terms or even in certain circumstances the death penalty, regardless of one's nationality. The Chinese police regularly raid bars and clubs to check for the presence of illicit substances, and have also been known to raid private residences.

Chinese authorities routinely screen passengers arriving in, or transiting through, China for illegal drugs and infectious diseases. In the case of drugs, passengers testing positive may be subject to arrest, detention and deportation, even if consumption of the relevant drug is legal in the country in which it took place. Passengers are advised to bear this in mind in the period prior to travelling to, or transiting through, China.

### **Legal Age**

In China, a person aged 14 years and above is treated as an adult under the law.

### **Religion**

There are restrictions on preaching and distributing religious materials. The Falun Gong movement is banned in China.

### **Dual Nationality**

Irish law has no bar on dual nationality. However, Chinese authorities do not recognise dual nationality. If you have both Chinese and Irish nationality and enter China on an Irish passport, the authorities may not recognise Irish citizenship and may not grant access to consular assistance. If a former Chinese national has formally renounced Chinese citizenship, they may need to carry evidence that they have done so.

### **Chinese Nationality and Children**

Irish law has no bar on dual nationality. However, Chinese authorities do not recognise dual nationality and Chinese law states that children born to Chinese nationals are Chinese nationals, regardless of the citizenship of the other parent. It is the responsibility of parents to ensure that their child is correctly registered after birth. The Chinese authorities may not recognise a child in these circumstances as an Irish citizen or grant access for consular assistance.
