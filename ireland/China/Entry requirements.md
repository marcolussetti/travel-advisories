## Entry requirements

### **Passport**

A valid passport is required to enter China, with a validity date at least six months beyond the end of the intended period of stay. It is also advisable to take a number of photocopies of your passport with you, and to store a photo of the data (personal identification) and Chinese visa pages of your passport on your phone. It is also advisable to leave a photocopy of the data page of your passport and a copy of your Chinese visa page with a family member or a friend at home.

It is a legal requirement to carry your passport at all times when travelling in China and, if living in China, your residency card.

Any citizen who has lost their passport must obtain a police report and then obtain an Emergency Travel Document from the Embassy. An exit visa must then be applied for, from the Chinese Entry Exit Bureau, to place in the Emergency Travel Document, in order to leave China. The estimated processing time for an exit visa is seven days.

### **Visa**

China has announced that from 30 November 2024 until 31 December 2025, citizens of Ireland holding an ordinary Irish passport travelling to China for business, tourism, family or friends visit, exchange and transit, are eligible for visa-free entry for a duration not exceeding 30 days. **Individuals who do not meet the visa-free conditions or who are official passport holders still need to apply for a visa or a visa free certificate before entering China.**

A valid passport is required for travel to China. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.

Further information and relevant announcements can be found on the website of the [**Embassy of China in Dublin**](http://ie.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/qzfw/). or obtained by contacting nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate. See also the Entry Requirements tab on this webpage.

Additional information regarding visa policy can be found on the website of Chinaâ€™s [**National Immigration Administration**](https://en.nia.gov.cn/index.html).

Ensure that you leave China before your visa expires, or before the period of visa-free travel expires. If you wish to extend your stay in China you must contact the local Public Security Bureau. Violations of Chinese immigration laws can result in severe penalties, including arrest, imprisonment, fine and deportation.

If planning to work in China and bring your family, you may need to submit authenticated birth and marriage certificates with their residence applications. Other documentation may need to be authenticated. The Irish Embassy cannot authenticate documents; only the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin can authenticate your certificates, and for them to be legally valid in China they should then be legalised by the Chinese Embassy in Dublin. We recommend checking these requirements with your employer before you travel.

Ensure you keep check of your visa expiry date. If you need to extend or apply for a new visa while in China, you must apply through the local Public Security Bureau. Be aware that visa extensions cannot exceed the term of the original visa so travellers issued with a 30-day visa can only apply for an extension of 30 days once. Please note that there is an average of 30 days processing time for visa overstay fines, which may be prolonged to 60 days. The Irish Embassy in China cannot influence or speed up this processing time. An overstay will prove very costly so ensure to have sufficient money to support yourself, and seek accommodation during this processing time

### **Registration**

Foreigners must register with the local Public Security Bureau (police station) **within 24 hours** of arrival in China. If staying in a hotel or hostel, they will carry out this procedure on your behalf. If staying with friends or family, you must register personally.
