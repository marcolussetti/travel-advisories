## Natural disasters and climate

### **Earthquake**

China is located in an active seismic zone and is periodically subject to major earthquakes. It is important to familiarise yourself with these guidelines from the [**Red Cross**](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/earthquake) so you know how to respond in an emergency situation.

Latest tsunami warnings can be found on the [**South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center**](http://scstac.oceanguide.org.cn/index.htm) website.

### **Flooding**

Flooding is common in some parts of China, particularly along the Yangtze River Basin, during the wet season (May to November). In cases of flooding, move to higher ground and wait for the flooding to abate. The Chinese military play a role in evacuating flooded areas; if affected, follow their instructions closely for your own safety. Citizens should, however, be aware, that flooding can occur in other areas as well, as was the case with the Zhengzhou floods (Henan Province) in July 2021.

### **Typhoons**

Typhoons are common along the south-eastern seaboard of China between May and November. Check the local and international news and [**weather**](https://severeweather.wmo.int/) before travelling to ensure that you will not be caught in a typhoon-affected area. Avoid visiting isolated or rural areas if a typhoon system is forecast. Always follow the advice of the local authorities.
