### **General Travel Advice**

Irish citizens need a valid passport or passport card to enter Guadeloupe.

Guadeloupe is an Overseas Department of France and part of the European Union. Irish passports do not have a minimum validity requirement while travelling to the UK or within the EU. When travelling within Europe with an Irish passport, it should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Irish citizens do not require a visa to enter Guadeloupe.

Visitors to Guadeloupe are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what is going on by monitoring local news and social media.

The best help is often close at hand so if a problem arises, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representatives or hotel management.

Visitors can contact the emergency services in Guadeloupe by dialling 112. Specific emergency numbers are:
