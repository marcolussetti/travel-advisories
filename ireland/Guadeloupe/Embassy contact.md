## Embassy contact

As there is no Irish Embassy in Guadeloupe, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the [**Irish Embassy in Paris**](https://www.ireland.ie/en/france/paris/contact/)**.**

If urgent assistance is required while the Embassy is closed, please contact the main Embassy number, 0033(0) 1 44 17 67 00, and leave a message for the Duty Officer.

This mailbox will be monitored regularly.
