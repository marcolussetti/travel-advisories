### **Travel Insurance / Medical Treatment**

Medical services in Timor-Leste are limited, particularly outside Dili. There are very few dental and optical services. In the event of a serious medical emergency, evacuation to Australia or Singapore is likely to be the only option for treatment.

For emergency medical assistance, **dial 110** and ask for an ambulance.

Irish citizens are advised to **make sure they have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.** Travellers are advised to contact their insurance/medical assistance company promptly if referred to a medical facility for treatment.

### **Medication**

Access to medicines is limited: bring sufficient supplies of any prescription medication

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Timor-Leste authorities to ensure the medication is legal in Timor-Leste. Medication should be in original packaging and with a copy of the original prescription.

### **Chikungunya, Dengue Fever, and Tuberculosis**

Chikungunya, dengue fever, and tuberculosis are common throughout Timor-Leste. There is usually an increase in dengue cases during the rainy season, which runs from November to April.

To avoid mosquito-borne illnesses it is advisable to use bed nets and repellents, and to wear closed shoes, long sleeves and trousers.

### **Water**

We recommend drinking only, filtered and boiled or bottled water.
