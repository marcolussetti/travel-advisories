## Embassy contact

As Ireland does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Timor-Leste, consular assistance is provided via the Embassy of Ireland in Indonesia.

If you require emergency assistance from the Embassy, please contact us on +62 (0) 21 2809 4300. If you call outside normal working hours with an emergency involving an Irish citizen, you will be given instructions to call another number to speak to a Duty Officer.

If you have a consular assistance query while travelling in Timor-Leste please email jakartaconsularassistance@dfa.ie (not monitored outside normal working hours).

You may also wish to call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin directly at +353 1 408 2000.

Monday to Friday 09:00-13:00 and 13:30-16:00 Dublin time
