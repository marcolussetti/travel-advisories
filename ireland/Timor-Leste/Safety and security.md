## Safety and security

### **Crime**

Crimes against foreigners in Timor-Leste are uncommon. However, you should be vigilant at all times and avoid displaying expensive items of jewellery or carrying large sums of money. There have been reports of harassment and violence against women.

There are occasional incidents of fighting between groups in various districts around Timor-Leste, often but not always related to martial arts groups. These incidents often involve stone throwing and occasionally machetes and knives. Most happen at night.

### **Terrorism**

There is a low threat from terrorism, but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.

### **Local Travel**

Crocodiles have been seen at beaches and inland waterways, especially in rural areas, and attacks have been reported. Always seek local advice before swimming, fishing, or any other water-related activities.

Be vigilant in border areas where there have been recent cases of rabies.

### **Road Travel**

Poor road quality and an increasing number of cars, especially in Dili, make driving in Timor-Leste hazardous. Accidents are frequent especially involving two-wheeled vehicles. If hiring a vehicle, consider hiring a local driver.

Drivers must hold a current driving licence valid for the class of vehicle they plan to drive. You should obtain motor vehicle insurance.

Take extra care when it is wet. Travel in convoy whenever possible. Main routes are often single-track mountain roads, which can deteriorate rapidly and become impassable, particularly during the rainy season (November-April).

### **Political Situation**

Avoid any demonstrations and large crowds, as these have the potential to deteriorate quickly and turn violent.
