## Local laws and customs

Remember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper or hostile, or may even be illegal.

### **Drugs**

Don't become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for breaking the law can be severe.
