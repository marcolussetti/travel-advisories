## Safety and security

### **Unrest**

Caution should be exercised on Malé Island where political protests have been ongoing and there remains a possibility of civil unrest.

Irish citizens travelling within the Maldives are advised to take extra care, follow the advice of local authorities and avoid any large gatherings, protests or rallies.

### **Crime**

Petty crime is rare; however, there are reports of theft of personal items from beaches and in hotel rooms.

Gang-related violence, including knife crime, has increased in populated areas, including Malé; however, there are no reports of any such violence on resort islands.

### **Terrorism**

There is a risk of terrorism in the Maldives. We advise you to be aware of your surroundings, avoid any demonstrations that may occur and monitor the media and other local sources for information about possible safety or security risks.

### **Safety**

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. There have been several diving injuries and deaths due to poor equipment and poor compliance to safety standards by local dive operators.

Be careful when swimming in the sea, as several people drown each year because of strong and dangerous currents.
