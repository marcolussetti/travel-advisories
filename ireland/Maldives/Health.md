### **Vaccinations**

Check with your doctor well in advance of travelling to see if you need any vaccinations for this country. We advise you to take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel.

### **Medical Facilities**

Maldives has limited medical facilities. There are two hospitals in Malé that deal with routine medical problems, but some island resorts can be several hours' travel away from Malé. Medical evacuation, which can be very expensive, may be necessary in the event of serious illness or injury, so make sure your travel insurance covers this eventuality.

### **Zika Virus**

In the past there have been outbreaks of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in the Maldives. Infection with Zika virus has been increasingly linked with a serious birth condition called microcephaly where the baby is born with an abnormally small head and/or brain damage. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and plan to travel to areas affected by the Zika Virus, you are advised to discuss your travel plans with your healthcare provider and to consider postponing your travel to affected areas. Irish Citizens are advised to follow the advice of the [**Health Protection Surveillance Centre**](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Vectorborne/Zika/).
