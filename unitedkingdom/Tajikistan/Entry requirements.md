# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Tajikistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Tajikistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Tajik Embassy in the UK](https://mfa.tj/en/london/contacts).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Tajikistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to enter Tajikistan. If you arrive without a valid visa, you may be detained and refused entry. Travellers who have arrived without the correct documentation have been fined and deported. You will be required to pay for any ticket out of Tajikistan.

If you’re entering Tajikistan on a visa, check it and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.

Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. If you overstay your visa, you could get a fine and will not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until you get an exit visa. You can pay for an exit visa at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consular Office. Once you’re in Tajikistan, you can apply for a visa extension at the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://old.consular.tj/visa.aspx).

Exit visas are not available at airports in Tajikistan. If you’re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.

### Applying for a visa

[Apply online for an e-visa](https://www.evisa.tj/index.evisa.html) from the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travelling or for a physical visa on arrival (must be pre-approved). Carefully review the guidance provided on the Tajikistan e-visa website on length of visa validity. Your e-visa will only be valid for 60 days after approval. Make sure you get the correct type of visa and that it will be valid for the duration of your visit. British nationals have been turned away with incorrect visas. Allow at least two weeks for processing.

You may be asked to provide proof of hotel bookings and any arrangements booked through a tour operator to be issued with a tourist visa or e-visa. This is usually requested in the form of a letter of invitation (LoI), a formal letter addressed to either the applicant or consular office by a Tajik-based sponsor providing details of the applicant and sponsor.

### Travelling through Tajikistan

You must have a transit visa to travel through Tajikistan on your way to another country. These are usually valid for 3 days. If you need to stay longer, you must seek an extension from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://old.consular.tj/visa.aspx) once you arrive.

## Registering with the authorities

If you are entering Tajikistan without an e-visa and staying for longer than 10 days, you must register with the Office for Registration of Foreign Citizens (OVIR) located at 5 Mirzo Tursunzoda Street, Dushanbe. Hotels are no longer permitted to complete the registration on your behalf. If you later stay at different addresses, you must register again separately.

If you do not follow the registration procedure, you may not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until your registration process is resolved. This may result in fines or detention. There have been cases where lack of registration has resulted in detention at Dushanbe airport.

## Tajik-British dual nationality

Tajikistan does not recognise dual British nationality if the person concerned is also a Tajik national. If you enter Tajikistan with dual UK-Tajik nationality, the British Embassy will only be able to provide limited consular assistance. If you’re arrested or detained, the Tajik authorities are unlikely to allow you to get help from the British Embassy.

## Travel permit for the Gorno-Badakhshan Region

You must get a separate travel permit, in addition to a Tajik visa, to travel to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. If you’re in the UK, contact the [Tajik Embassy](https://mfa.tj/en/london) to apply for a permit before you travel. If you’re in Tajikistan, contact the [Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://old.consular.tj/Default_en.aspx).

The Tajikistan government sometimes stops issuing permits to tourists at short notice due to security concerns. The Tajik Embassy can tell you whether the government is issuing permits for travel to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region.

## Travel permit for the Khatlon Region

You must get a permit, in addition to a Tajik visa, to travel to areas within 20km of the border with Afghanistan in the Khatlon Region, including Panj and Kumsangir. Apply for a permit from the [Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://old.consular.tj/Default_en.aspx) in Dushanbe before you travel  to the Khatlon region.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Tajikistan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/219/tajikistan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

### HIV screening

If you plan to stay for more than 90 days, you must show a medical certificate that you’re HIV-free or take a test. FCDO advises against taking the test in Tajikistan due to the poor quality of medical facilities.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Tajikistan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Foreign nationals travelling to Tajikistan should be aware of the country’s customs regulations regarding the import and export of cash:

### Bringing cash into Tajikistan

Travellers may bring up to $10,000 US dollars (or equivalent in other currencies) into Tajikistan without declaring it at customs. Any amount exceeding this should be declared before entry. Travellers may take up to $3,000 US dollars (or equivalent) out of the country without declaration. If the amount exceeds $10,000 US dollars, travellers must present documentation confirming the origin of the funds.

### Customs declaration forms

Customs declaration forms are available in Russian and English. It is recommended to retain your entry declaration form until departure to prove the amount of money originally brought into the country. Failure to declare or provide documentation may result in fines or delays at the border.
