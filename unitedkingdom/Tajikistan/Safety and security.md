# Safety and security

This guide also has safety advice for [regions of Tajikistan](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/regional-risks).

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Tajikistan

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Tajikistan.

Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

* transport hubs
* embassies
* religious sites and places of worship
* sporting and cultural events
* shopping centres and crowded places

Examples of previous significant attacks include:

* in March 2024, a plot to attack New Year (Nowruz) celebrations in Vahdat using poison was disrupted by Tajik authorities
* in 2023, three suspected terrorists were reportedly killed by Tajik border forces while planning an attack ahead of Tajik national day celebrations. There are infrequent incursions by armed criminal and terrorist groups across the Afghanistan border into Tajikistan, mainly at night

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

## Political situation

Avoid demonstrations or large gatherings of people, which are likely to attract a heavy presence from security forces. Use caution and maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places. Be alert to any security announcements by the Tajik authorities.

## Crime

There have been occasional muggings and petty crime against foreigners in Dushanbe. Pickpocketing is common in crowded places such as markets and on public transport. Criminals may target foreigners as they are assumed to be carrying valuable items. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view.

Use caution and take measures to reduce your personal risk, such as:

* keep sight of your belongings at all times
* be aware of thieves using distraction techniques
* avoid carrying all your valuables together in one place e.g. handbags or pockets
* consider avoiding walking alone at night
* exercise a similar level of caution as you would in the UK
* do not use unofficial taxis or a taxi already occupied by a passenger, particularly at night. Consider using private cars or pre-arranged taxis
* do not show large amounts of money and be wary of strangers offering help or being over-friendly

### Bank card fraud

Fraudsters can steal your card details without you noticing. Use ATMs inside banks if possible, and check ATMs on the street for signs of tampering. Keep cards in sight when paying in shops and restaurants. Read [more about how to avoid bank card fraud](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z-of-fraud/bank-card-and-cheque-fraud).

### Drink spiking and sexual assault

There have been cases of sexual assault, including rape, reported to the British Embassy. This includes suspected use of ‘date rape’ drugs targeting foreigners. Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. You should:

* not leave drinks unattended
* not accept drinks from strangers
* be aware of how much you are drinking
* not accept lifts from strangers or acquaintances at any time

Don’t split up from your friends, do not leave drinks unattended and do not go off with people you do not know. Save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easy to find. See [TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’](https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/#stick_with_your_mates) for tips and advice.

## Intimidation at Dushanbe International Airport

There have been cases of harassment by officials at Dushanbe International Airport. This includes requests for payment for allegedly incorrect documentation or other offences. Check with your hotel that your documentation and papers are in order before passing through border control at the airport. If you’re harassed or intimidated, report it to your travel agent or the consular bureau at the airport.

## Laws and cultural differences

Tajikistan has a secular constitution. Most Tajik citizens are Muslims and may be conservative, particularly in rural areas. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Make sure your actions do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or when you visit religious areas sites.

### Ramadan

Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Cafés and restaurants may amend their menus and be busy around fast-breaking (‘Iftar’). Areas around mosques are also likely to be busy around prayer times. Be particularly aware of religious sensitivities at this time.

### Personal ID

You must carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it, with you at all times. The police can arrest you if you do not carry ID. You can get a copy of your passport notarised in the UK and translated into Tajik or Russian, or use a copy notarised in Tajikistan.

### Alcohol laws and bans

The legal age for purchasing alcohol is 18. If you appear to be drunk, the police can take you to a police station and issue you with a fine or detain you in a police cell overnight.

### Smoking ban

It is illegal to smoke on the street in Tajikistan, and punishable by a fine.

### Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Possession of drugs is illegal. You can get a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. Prison conditions are basic.

The police may conduct drug raids in bars and night clubs. Stay calm and follow instructions.

### Woman travelling alone

Women travelling alone in Tajikistan may receive unwanted attention, harassment or other difficulties. Consider not going out alone at night. See [advice for women travelling abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad).

### Using cameras in secure areas

It is illegal to take photos of or use drones near anything related to the military or security, including border checkpoints, military sites and police stations. Check carefully that you are not near any military or security facilities. The Tajik authorities may ask you not to photograph government buildings.

### Drones

The possession or use of drones or UAVs is prohibited unless you have permission from the Tajik National Security Committee. If you are found using drones without permission, you may be detained and your equipment confiscated.

### LGBT+ travellers

Although same-sex sexual activity is not illegal under Tajik law, local attitudes are generally conservative and levels of tolerance and acceptance in society vary, particularly outside the main cities. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted and negative attention.

Read more [advice for LGBT+ travellers](https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice).

### Money

Tajikistan is mainly a cash-only economy. Very few businesses accept credit cards and travellers’ cheques are not accepted. There is an increasing number of ATMs in Dushanbe and other larger towns, but none in rural areas. Most ATMs only accept Visa cards.

Bring enough cash for your entire stay or withdraw cash from an ATM in Dushanbe ahead of any planned travel to other regions. Only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges.

Tajik somoni is only available in Tajikistan. US dollars are the most easily exchanged and widely accepted foreign currency. Euros or Russian roubles are also easy to exchange. It may be difficult to exchange other currencies. Official exchange booths may not accept damaged or marked bank notes, nor will they accept US dollars issued before 2013.

### Posting on social media

Be careful when posting images of your visit on social media. It is illegal to post images or comments on social media that show disrespect towards religion, culture or national symbols. If you share or publish images that the authorities consider to be insulting, you could get a fine or a prison sentence. Disrespectful content, including criticism of the government, could result in fines or detention.

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

### Trekking and mountaineering

Trekking in Tajikistan often involves travelling to very remote areas. There is a high risk of avalanches, landslides and rockfalls. Weather can change very quickly, and heavy rains or snowfall can block roads and trekking routes, particularly in the autumn and winter.

At higher altitudes there is a possibility of snow in the summer months. Sunstroke and serious sunburn can also cause problems, particularly in mountainous areas.

You should:

* get appropriate insurance, including for any activity at high altitude
* use a reputable trekking agency
* let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return
* not trek alone
* adapt your plans to reflect local conditions and advice

In remote areas, mobile phone coverage is extremely limited, and medical facilities are basic. Most Tajik mobile phones have difficulties connecting to satellite phones. The difficult terrain can make access impossible in some cases.

There is a limited mountain rescue service staffed by volunteers and rescue equipment they have is limited. This will be further limited in cases where individuals need rescuing at high altitudes or where weather conditions do not allow.

Weather conditions can change rapidly at short notice, particularly in mountainous and high-altitude locations. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has a Tourist Police Section and the  department can take calls 24/7 Tel (+99237) 231 80 36, Mobile phone (+992) 770 55 55 55.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Tajikistan, see information on [driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

### Driving licence and permit requirements

You are permitted to drive in Tajikistan with a valid UK driving licence for up to 30 days. In addition, you must carry the 1968 version of the International Driving Permit (IDP) alongside your UK licence:

* the IDP must be obtained before traveling, as it cannot be purchased outside the UK
* while not legally required, it is strongly recommended to have your driving licence and IDP translated into Russian or Tajik to facilitate smoother interactions with local traffic authorities

### Driving your own vehicle

You can bring your personal vehicle into Tajikistan without paying import duties or taxes for a period of up to 60 days. After this period, you will need to pay a fee. You must declare your vehicle at the point of entry, carry both your vehicle registration documents and valid insurance that covers driving in Tajikistan.

### Car rental considerations

If you plan to rent a vehicle in Tajikistan, be aware that rental companies may impose stricter requirements, such as:

* a minimum age for drivers
* at least one year of driving experience
* mandatory possession of an IDP

### Road rules and safety

Tajikistan enforces the following road laws:

* drive on the right-hand side of the road
* seatbelts must be worn by both drivers and all passengers
* mobile phone use while driving is prohibited
* there is a zero-tolerance policy for alcohol consumption while driving

### Driving conditions

Road infrastructure in Tajikistan can be challenging. Surfaces may be uneven or poorly maintained, especially in rural and mountainous areas, where areas may only be accessible by 4-wheel drive vehicles. Street lighting is often poor. Driving standards may vary significantly and can be unpredictable. Vehicles in Tajikistan are often poorly maintained. Petrol stations are rare outside towns and there are no breakdown companies. Make sure you take all you need for your journey and allow for delays. Consider bringing a satellite phone for travel outside towns to use in an emergency. Neighbouring countries may close borders temporarily.

Conditions are particularly dangerous in spring due to the risk of avalanches and landslides.

Many interior roads are only open in the summer months. It is possible to drive from Dushanbe to the north and Tajikistan’s second city, Khujand, using a tunnel. This road is particularly dangerous in winter due to icy conditions. Drivers can be trapped for a long time if caught in an avalanche due to the remote location.

Flooding in the spring and winter often damages and closes roads in areas of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region and other parts of the country. Many roads, including the Pamir Highway, are open but not fully repaired.

### Taxis and buses

Use licensed taxis whenever possible. Unlicensed taxis can occasionally be found, despite licensing laws. Many taxis do not have rear seatbelts, so you may want to request a taxi that has them.

### Air travel

In May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes buying flight tickets.

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to [prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

### Earthquakes

Earthquakes are a risk in Tajikistan, particularly the east in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Avalanches and landslides caused by earthquakes often block roads in the spring and early summer.

Learn earthquake safety procedures and follow the advice of the local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about [what to do before, during and after an earthquake](https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes).

### Flooding

In late spring and summer, there can be seasonal flooding and mudslides caused by melting glaciers. Take care, follow local advice and be aware that conditions can change suddenly.

### Snow

Heavy snowfall in winter can cause delays and cancellations at airports and disrupt travel, particularly in mountainous regions where there’s an increased risk of avalanches. Take local advice on road conditions during or following severe weather.
