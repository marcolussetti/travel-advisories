# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Tajikistan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security).

## Border crossings

Tajikistan’s borders with neighbouring countries can close without notice and some borders may not be open to foreign travellers.

Check with the Tajikistan authorities before you travel to see which crossings are open.

### Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border

There is a history of border clashes in this area, and the security situation can change at short notice. There have been no further clashes since the border agreement in 2025. However, unexploded landmines and weapons continue to pose a serious risk. Border areas may be subject to sudden restrictions on movement and a heightened security presence. You should exercise caution if travelling near the Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan border, check local conditions before travel, and follow the advice of the local authorities.

### Tajikistan-Afghanistan border

In November 2025, five Chinese nationals were killed in two separate cross-border attacks launched from Afghanistan in the Shamsiddin Shohon (Khatlon) and Darvoz (GBAO) regions.

Armed clashes or incursions by armed terrorist or criminal groups may occur without notice near the border with Afghanistan. Stay alert and be cautious in these areas. Do not walk off-road – there are both marked and unmarked minefields. Read [information on terrorism](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tajikistan/safety-and-security#terrorism).

## Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region

There is a risk of civil unrest in Khorog and other towns in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO). There were serious disturbances in 2021 and there have been violent clashes in and around Khorog since 2022 with casualties. There is an increased security presence. Some roads in Khorog, Rushan and other parts of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region are temporarily closed. The security situation can change at short notice, with the possibility of further unrest.

Border Guard patrols may ask to see your passport and GBAO permit when you travel in GBAO, particularly in areas close to the border with Afghanistan

If you’re travelling in the region, be alert in public places and check for security announcements by the local authorities.

## Tavildara Region

Take local advice in the Tavildara Region of central Tajikistan, as there are minefields dating from the civil war in the mountains.

Medical and rescue facilities are unreliable where they exist at all.
