# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 03 (or 103 from a mobile phone) and ask for an ambulance. The operator will likely only speak Tajik and Russian.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Tajikistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/219/tajikistan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Tajikistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/219/tajikistan).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Tajikistan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air quality

Tajikistan, particularly Dushanbe and Khatlon region, often suffers from poor air quality, particularly during dust storms. Try to minimise your exposure to outside air by staying in an air-conditioned indoor place as much as possible, with windows and doors closed and well sealed.

Wash all fruit, vegetables and other foods, which might have been exposed. Regularly damp-dust all indoor surfaces, washing your hands afterwards. Monitor local reports and weather forecasts for the latest information and advice.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Basic medicines including painkillers are available without a prescription. Phone a Tajik pharmacy in advance to check if your UK prescription will be accepted. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Tajik. You can get a translation in Tajikistan– [find an interpreter or translator](https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/translators-interpreters?country=Tajikistan).

Some prescription medications are not widely available. Medications often come under different brand names and Western brand name drugs may be counterfeit, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If your medication is not available, you may be able to get it couriered from a third country, though this could take time.

You may need to pay cash for medication

## Healthcare in Tajikistan

The quality of medical care in Tajikistan is generally poor. Most medical facilities are badly equipped and unhygienic, with a limited supply of drugs. Medical facilities outside Dushanbe are quite basic and, in some locations, almost non-existent. There is no guarantee that equipment will have been properly sterilised, especially in rural hospitals. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Tajikistan

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Tajikistan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tajikistan-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
