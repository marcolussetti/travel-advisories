## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

### Turkey-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 10km of the border with Syria due to fighting and a heightened risk of terrorism.

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/regional-risks).

## Support from the UK government

While 24-hour consular assistance is available by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in areas where we advise against travel.

## Regional escalation

Regional escalation poses significant security risks and has led to travel disruption.

British nationals should:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* follow advice from the local authorities
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, stay indoors or find the nearest safe building or designated shelter. An interior stairwell or a room with as few external walls or windows as possible may provide additional protection
