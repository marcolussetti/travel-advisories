## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

### Turkey-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 10km of the border with Syria due to fighting and a heightened risk of terrorism.

## Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests are currently taking place in Istanbul and other cities across Turkey. Demonstrations may become violent. The police response has included use of tear gas and water cannons. You should:

* monitor local media
* plan ahead to avoid disruption
* avoid crowds and demonstrations

## Counterfeit alcohol

There has been an increase in the number of deaths and serious illnesses in Turkey, including in Ankara and Istanbul, caused by drinking illegally produced local spirits and counterfeit bottles of branded alcohol. For advice on how to avoid these products, see [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/safety-and-security#counterfeit-alcohol).

## Support from the UK government

While 24-hour consular assistance is available by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in areas where we advise against travel.
