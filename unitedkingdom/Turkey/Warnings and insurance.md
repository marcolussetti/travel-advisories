## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

### Turkey-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 10km of the border with Syria due to fighting and a heightened risk of terrorism.
