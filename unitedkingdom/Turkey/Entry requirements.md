# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Turkey set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Turkish Embassy in the UK](https://london-emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Turkey, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 150 days after the date you arrive and at least 1 blank page.

If you live in Turkey, your passport must be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.

If entering at a land border, make sure officials stamp and date your passport at the border crossing.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can visit Turkey without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, for business or tourism.

If you hold a British citizen passport, you can visit Turkey  without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period, for business or tourism

If you hold [another type of British passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality), you will need a visa and should check visa requirements with the Turkish Embassy or Consulate General before you travel.

To enter Turkey for education, employment or medical purposes, or in other special cases, check the [information on applying for a visa](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/general-information-about-turkish-visas.en.mfa). If you plan to work in Turkey, make sure you have the correct permits.

## Day trips to Greek islands

If you are considering a day trip to a Greek Island, be aware that Greece is in the Schengen Zone and has introduced the European Union (EU) [Entry Exit System (EES)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-entryexit-system).

This applies to any non-EU national travelling from Turkey into the EU by land, sea or air (excluding airport transit). EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete, so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border.
