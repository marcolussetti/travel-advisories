# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the Philippines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/178/philippines#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in the Philippines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/178/philippines), including  :

* dengue
* tick-borne encephalitis
* Zika virus

Mosquito-borne diseases are a risk all year round. However, there’s a heightened risk of dengue during the rainy season from June to October. Take precautions to [avoid being bitten by mosquitoes](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of the Philippines. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in the Philippines

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in the Philippines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/philippines-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines and may not meet the standards of care in the UK, particularly in rural and remote areas. Many places, including some tourist destinations, do not have easy access to emergency medical care.

Private hospital treatment and medical transport is expensive – the daily cost in intensive care units can be more than £1,000. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment, including repatriation.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
