# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Philippines’ rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the Philippines set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Philippine Embassy in the UK](https://londonpe.dfa.gov.ph/).

## Philippines e-travel system

You must [register with the ‘e-travel’ system](https://etravel.gov.ph/) before boarding your flight to the Philippines. You can register up to 72 hours before your arrival in the Philippines.

## Passport validity requirements

To enter the Philippines, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit the Philippines without a visa for tourism or business for up to 30 days.

Some airlines will not carry you if you cannot produce your departure ticket and show the QR code issued by the [e-travel system](https://etravel.gov.ph/).

To enter the Philippines as a visitor, you must have a ticket for your return or onward travel.

To stay more than 30 days, you can [apply for an extension](https://e-services.immigration.gov.ph/Dashboard/Index) when you are in the Philippines. If you overstay any visa without authority, it is a serious matter. You could face fees and fines, and detention if you cannot pay them, or you could be deported at your own expense.

If you want a visa to live, work, or study in the Philippines, you’ll need to meet the requirements of the [Philippine immigration regulations](http://immigration.gov.ph/). This includes having certain UK documents (birth certificates, marriage certificates, UK police certificates and school documents) [legalised by the Legalisation Office](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised) (not by the Philippine Embassy in London).

### Children travelling without their parents

If your non-Filipino children aged 14 or under are travelling without either parent, you must apply for a [waiver of exclusion ground](https://londonpe.dfa.gov.ph/consular-matters/forms) for entry into the Philippines.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter the Philippines, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio   vaccine if you are coming from certain countries with a transmission risk

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Philippines guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/178/philippines#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of the Philippines](https://customs.gov.ph/home/traveler-homepage/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into the Philippines

You cannot take in more than 50,000 Philippine pesos.

If you are bringing in foreign currency (cash or cheques) worth more than 10,000 US dollars, you must declare it on your foreign currency declaration form on arrival.

## Exit requirements

If you have stayed in the Philippines for 6 months or more on a tourist visa, you must get an [emigration clearance certificate](https://e-services.immigration.gov.ph/Dashboard/Index?ReturnUrl=%2FEmigrationClearanceCertificateB) (ECC) during the 72 hours before you leave the country.

If you were in the Philippines on a visa issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Board of Investments (BoI), or the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), you will need a travel pass from the department that issued your visa to leave the Philippines. If you have an ECC, you do not need a travel pass.

### Airport tax

If you’re leaving the country from Cebu Mactan airport, you must pay a departure tax of 850 Philippine pesos in local currency or the equivalent in US dollars. There’s no longer a departure tax at Manila airport. This information can change and you should check with your airline before you travel.
