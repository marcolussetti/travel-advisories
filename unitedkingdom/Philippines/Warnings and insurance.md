Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago

FCDO advises against all travel to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to the remainder of Mindanao, except for:

* Camiguin Island
* Dinagat Island
* Siargao Island

This advice is due to terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups in south Philippines.

## Typhoon Fung-Wong

Typhoon Fung-Wong, locally named Uwan, made landfall in the Philippines on 9 November 2025, bringing damaging winds, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding to large parts of Luzon and the Visayas.

There are reports of disruption to transport (including domestic flights), electricity and communications in affected areas. The risk of flooding and landslides in affected areas is likely to remain over the coming days.

If you are in the affected areas:

* follow and monitor local weather updates from the [Philippines state weather agency](http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/) and the [Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council](http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/index.php)
* follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders

If you are planning to travel to Luzon or the Philippines:

* check with your travel provider or accommodation before travelling
* ensure your travel insurance covers natural disasters

## Tropical storm season

Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year. Most typhoons happen between June and November. Follow the advice of local authorities, and monitor the progress of storms on the [Philippines state weather agency](http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/) and the [Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council](http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/index.php).
