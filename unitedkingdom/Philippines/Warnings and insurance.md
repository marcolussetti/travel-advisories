Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago

FCDO advises against all travel to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to the remainder of Mindanao, except for:

* Camiguin Island
* Dinagat Island
* Siargao Island

This advice is due to terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups in south Philippines.

Planned demonstrations are expected in Metro Manila on Sunday 21 September 2025. Locations may include Rizal Park (Luneta) in Manila and the People Power Monument, EDSA in Quezon City.

You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities. Demonstrations may lead to travel disruption. You should allow extra time for journeys and monitor local media for updates.
