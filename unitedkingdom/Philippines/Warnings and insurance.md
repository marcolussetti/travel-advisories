Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago

FCDO advises against all travel to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to the remainder of Mindanao, except for:

* Camiguin Island
* Dinagat Island
* Siargao Island

This advice is due to terrorist activity and clashes between the military and insurgent groups in south Philippines.

## Typhoon Ragasa

Typhoon Ragasa is currently expected to bring heavy rainfall and devastating wind impacts to the Batanes or Babuyan Islands in the northern Philippines from Monday 22 to Tuesday 23 September.

Typhoons can change course and intensity. Follow the advice of local authorities, and monitor the progress of storms on the [Philippines state weather agency](http://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/) and the [Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council](http://www.ndrrmc.gov.ph/index.php).

## Demonstrations

Demonstrations are expected over the coming weeks in Metro Manila and elsewhere in the Philippines.

You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings and follow the advice of local authorities. Demonstrations may lead to travel disruption. You should allow extra time for journeys and monitor local media for updates.
