# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

There is no general emergency medical number in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). If you have a medical emergency which requires an ambulance, contact a hospital to make this request.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for DRC](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in DRC](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/63/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) including:

* ebola
* malaria
* cholera
* yellow fever
* mpox

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of DRC. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in DRC

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in DRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-drc#healthcare-in-democratic-republic-of-congo) if you’re living in DRC.

Medical care is extremely limited. The Centre Prive d’Urgence (CPU) clinic in Kinshasa is able to cope with basic health problems and to stabilise a patient after most serious accidents. Outside Kinshasa, Western-standard medical facilities are almost non-existent. Medical evacuation to South Africa (or elsewhere) could be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

If you take medication regularly, make sure you bring enough for your time in the DRC, and that it is in properly marked packaging.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
