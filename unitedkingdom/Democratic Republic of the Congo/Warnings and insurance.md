## Security situation in DRC

### North and South Kivu

If you are in Goma or Bukavu and judge it safe to do so, and if routes are available, you should leave.

M23 rebels and Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and the surrounding areas in North and South Kivu. The situation remains highly unstable and unpredictable. Routes to depart Goma and Bukavu are limited and may change at short notice.

The border crossings between Rwanda and the DRC at Gisenyi-Goma and Ruzizi-Bukavu could close at short notice.

Goma and Bukavu airports have been attacked and commercial flights are no longer operating from the airports.

Support from the UK government is severely limited outside Kinshasa. You should not assume that FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country in the event of serious unrest or crisis.

### Kinshasa

There are increased security measures in the city of Kinshasa on 2 September 2025, particularly the area of Gombe. Measures may include vehicle checks and searches. There may be an increased risk of protests.
