# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 192 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Myanmar](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/156/myanmar-burma#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Myanmar](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/156/myanmar-burma) including:

* schistosomiasis – a parasitic infection caught in river water
* diseases spread by contaminated food and water – including:
  + hepatitis A
  + cholera
  + typhoid
* mosquito-borne diseases, including:
  + chikungunya
  + dengue
  + malaria
  + Zika virus

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Myanmar. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in pharmacies in Myanmar. Pharmaceutical products for sale could be counterfeit.

## Healthcare in Myanmar

The Myanmar public health sector is under severe strain. Private medical facilities continue to operate. In areas where an overnight curfew is in place, such as Yangon, you may struggle to access emergency healthcare during the night.

You’re unlikely to find competent medical advice and treatment easily outside Yangon and Mandalay, and any services provided will not be to the standard of those in the UK. For serious illness or injury, you may need to be transferred to a neighbouring country, most likely Thailand.

You’ll usually need to make cash payments up front to get medical treatment in Myanmar. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. The UK government cannot pay for medical expenses overseas.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Myanmar](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners)  where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health
