## Taking money into Myanmar

Myanmar is largely a cash-based society. Expect to rely on cash for most of your stay. There is significant disruption to banking services. Many ATMs do not accept UK or international bank cards and some banks have limits on daily withdrawals. Electronic payments and transfers are mostly working, but many commercial outlets will only accept cash. Visa is more widely accepted than Mastercard.

If you plan to bring more than 10,000 US dollars-worth of any foreign currency, you must declare this to customs on arrival or risk imprisonment.

If you have to pay a visa overstay fine or pay for excess baggage on departure, you will need to pay in US dollars.

Once you’re in Myanmar it is possible to change US dollars into Kyat, including at banks . However, some money exchanges have closed due to pressure from the authorities. Check your US dollars are in good condition, with no pen marks, folds or tears. Exchange counters prefer high-denomination bills and they typically inspect all notes  carefully.

Due to concerns over counterfeit money, exchange counters may refuse dollars with the letters AB and CB at the start of the serial number (top left-hand corner of the note).

If you want to pay for hotels or restaurants with a credit or debit card, phone ahead to check this will be possible.

You cannot import gold or gold bullion into Myanmar for trading and risk arrest for doing so. On arrival, you  must declare any valuable articles including gold, gems and jewellery with customs.
