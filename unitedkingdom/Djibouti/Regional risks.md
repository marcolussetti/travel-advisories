# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Djibouti. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/djibouti) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/djibouti/safety-and-security).

## Djibouti-Eritrea border

FCDO advises against all travel to the Djibouti-Eritrea border.

In 2008 there were military clashes between Djibouti and Eritrea after Eritrean forces entered the disputed Djibouti border region. The situation remains fragile and further conflict is possible.

## Djibouti-Somaliland border

Take great care if you travel to the Djibouti-Somaliland border. The Djiboutian military have set up roadblocks and checkpoints. Follow the advice given by the authorities and seek military approval for journeys in this area.

## Landmines near borders

There are unmarked landmines near the Djibouti-Eritrea border. In other border areas most landmines have been marked or cleared. Djibouti’s borders with Ethiopia and Somalia are not always clearly identified.

## Roads north of Tadjoura

Take great care travelling on roads north of Tadjoura and Obock where there are military roadblocks.

Respect advice given by those operating the roadblocks. If required, get formal military approval for your journey.
