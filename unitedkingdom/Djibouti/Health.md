# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 21 35 09 62 or 21 35 27 12 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Djibouti](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/65/djibouti#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Djibouti](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/65/djibouti#General_Information), including:

* dengue
* Zika virus
* schistosoma

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
