# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Grenada’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Grenada set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Grenadian High Commission in the UK](https://grenada-highcommission.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To visit Grenada, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport. If you do not get a stamp in your passport, you’ll be considered an illegal visitor.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Grenada without a visa.

On entry, you’ll be allowed to stay for a maximum period of 3 months.

To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Grenada Immigration Department’s entry requirements.

It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Grenada, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Grenada guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/93/grenada#Vaccine_Recommendations).
