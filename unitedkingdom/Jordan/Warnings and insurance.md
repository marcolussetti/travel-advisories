Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Jordan-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 3km of the border with Syria.

## Regional risks and airspace closure

Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Iran could escalate quickly and pose security risks for the wider region. There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. Travel disruption, including flight cancellations and airspace closures may occur. Demonstrations and protest activity may take place. Land border crossings may close with no notice.

You should:

* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities
* take shelter and stay away from windows if you hear air sirens. In the event of injuries or damage, call 911 immediately

As of 07:30 local time 14 June, Jordanian airspace has reopened but airports and airspace may close at short notice. Queen Alia International Airport is also closed. Before you travel:

* if you are in Jordan, contact your airline and follow the advice of the local authorities
* if you are not yet in country, check with your airline and travel insurer
