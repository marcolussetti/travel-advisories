Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Jordan-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 3km of the border with Syria.

## Regional risks

Hostilities in the region and between Israel and Iran have the potential to deteriorate further, quickly and without warning. On 22 June the US launched military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and on 23 June Iran launched military strikes against a US military base in Qatar. Iran aligned militia groups are also likely to continue to conduct attacks.

The current situation has disrupted air links and may disrupt road links and border crossings. Demonstrations and protest activity may take place.

As a precautionary measure, we encourage you to:

* read the FCDO’s advice on [if you’re affected by a crisis abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas)
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities
* take shelter and stay away from windows if you hear air sirens. In the event of injuries or damage, call 911 immediately
* avoid military or security facilities
* check with relevant airlines for the latest updates before travelling
* See [safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jordan/safety-and-security).

Jordanian airspace is open but airports and airspace may close at short notice. Before you travel:

* if you are in Jordan, contact your airline and follow the advice of the local authorities
* if you are not yet in country, check with your airline

There are three land border crossings from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  They are open most days from 8 or 8.30am.  Closures may happen at no notice, including over the weekend.

* King Hussein/Allenby Bridge
* The Northern (Sheikh Hussein/Bet Shean) crossing
* The Southern (Wadi Araba) crossing
