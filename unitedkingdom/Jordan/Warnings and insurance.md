Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Jordan-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 3km of the border with Syria.

## Regional risks

Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Iran could escalate quickly and pose security risks for the wider region. There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. Iran aligned militia groups are also likely to continue to conduct attacks.

The current situation has disrupted air links and may disrupt road links and border crossings. Demonstrations and protest activity may take place.

You should:

* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities
* take shelter and stay away from windows if you hear air sirens. In the event of injuries or damage, call 911 immediately
* See [safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jordan/safety-and-security).

Jordanian airspace is open but airports and airspace may close at short notice. Before you travel:

* if you are in Jordan, contact your airline and follow the advice of the local authorities
* if you are not yet in country, check with your airline

There are three land border crossings from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  They are open most days from 8 or 8.30am.  Closures may happen at no notice, including over the weekend.

* King Hussein/Allenby Bridge
* The Northern (Sheikh Hussein/Bet Shean) crossing
* The Southern (Wadi Araba) crossing
