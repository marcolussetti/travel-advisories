Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Jordan-Syria border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 3km of the border with Syria.

## Regional risks

Following hostilities in the region a ceasefire between Israel and Iran began on 24 June. Iran aligned militia groups are likely to continue to conduct attacks.

It could take time for transport networks and border crossings to get back to normal. Demonstrations and protest activity may take place.

You should:

* stay up to date with events in the region
* check for any transport disruption that may still be occurring
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* read the FCDO’s advice on [if you’re affected by a crisis abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas)
