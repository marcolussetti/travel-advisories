# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Jordan

Telephone: 911 (ambulance, fire, police)

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.

* where to get advice if you are in a dispute with a provider
* how to access previous versions of travel advice to support a claim

### Thefts

Your insurer may require a police report or crime reference number if you want to make a claim. This usually means you need to report the theft while you are still in the country. If your passport is stolen you must [cancel it as soon as possible](https://www.gov.uk/report-a-lost-or-stolen-passport).
