# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Jordan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Jordan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Jordan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Dual nationals

If you are a British-Jordanian dual national, you can use your British passport to enter Jordan, but you must show your Jordanian passport when you leave.

### Children with a Jordanian passport

Children with a Jordanian passport, who are travelling without their father, cannot depart Jordan without a letter of permission signed by their father. They must have a letter even if they enter Jordan on a British passport.

### Previous travel to Israel

If your passport has an Israeli stamp, you will not usually experience difficulties entering Jordan. If you have concerns, contact the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Jordan. You can get this on arrival.

If you wish to also visit Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and re-enter Jordan, you can get a multiple-entry visa from the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

### Applying for a visa

You can buy a single-entry visit visa when you arrive at a Jordanian airport or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border crossing. It costs 40 Jordanian dinars and is valid for one month. Some airlines may ask you to submit a health declaration at check-in.

If you’re visiting for tourism, you can [apply for a Jordan Pass online](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) before you arrive. You will not need to pay tourist entry visa fees if you stay at least 3 nights (4 days). The pass gives discounted entry to major tourist sites.

You can [extend your Jordan visa online](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf) for up to 6 months. You could get a fine if you overstay.

## Land border crossings

Land crossings with Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories may be restricted or close at short notice. There is also the possibility of trade union strikes closing the Israeli side of the border. See [Israel travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) and [Occupied Palestinian Territories travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories) and check with the Jordanian authorities before crossing.

The King Hussein Bridge/Allenby crossing is not an international crossing between Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Israel. You cannot enter Jordan using the King Hussein Bridge/Allenby crossing without getting a visa beforehand. You can get a visa from the [Jordanian Ministry of Interior](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf).

If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you can get a multiple-entry visa before you travel from the [Jordanian Ministry of Interior](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf). You should also check the [Israel travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) before using the land borders to enter Israel.

On the Jordanian side, board guards will stamp passports unless the traveller requests otherwise and tells them before they hand over their passport.

Photography and videography are not permitted on the border crossings.

## Departure tax

You must pay a departure tax of 10 Jordanian dinars in cash at all land border crossings. There are usually ATMs at the border.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Jordan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/115/jordan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Health screening

### HIV test

You must have a HIV test if you are staying in Jordan for more than 30 days. It costs 20 Jordanian dinars to get the health certificate.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Jordan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Drones

You must [apply for approval to take a drone](https://carc.gov.jo/en/drones) into Jordan at least 10 working days before you travel. If you have not received a permit before you arrive, the authorities will hold your drone at the airport. You can collect it when you leave Jordan.
