# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Jordan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Jordan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Jordan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

### British-Jordanian dual nationals

If you are a British-Jordanian dual national, you can use your British passport to enter Jordan, but you must show your Jordanian passport when you leave.

### Children with a Jordanian passport

Children with a Jordanian passport, who are travelling without their father, cannot depart Jordan without a letter of permission signed by their father. They must have a letter even if they enter Jordan on a British passport.

### Previous travel to Israel

If your passport has an Israeli stamp, you will not usually experience difficulties entering Jordan. If you have concerns, contact the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Jordan.

If you wish to also visit Israel or Palestine and re-enter Jordan, you can get a multiple-entry visa from the [Jordanian Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London).

### Applying for a visit visa

You can buy a single-entry visit visa when you arrive at a Jordanian airport or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border land crossing. It costs 40 Jordanian dinars (JOD) and is valid for 3 months. Some airlines may ask you to submit a health declaration at check-in. Check with your airline.

If you’re visiting for tourism, and you will stay at least 3 nights in Jordan, you can [apply for a Jordan Pass online](https://www.jordanpass.jo/) before you arrive. A Jordan Pass costs between 70 and 80 Jordanian dinars, which includes the visa fee and gives discounted entry to major tourist sites. You should only purchase a Jordan Pass from the official website. The Jordan Pass is valid for 3 months from date of entry.

You can [extend your Jordan visit visa online](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf) for up to 6 months. You could get a fine if you overstay.

### Visiting Jordan for purposes other than tourism

If you are visiting Jordan for purposes other than tourism, you must apply for your visa in advance [online](https://moi.gov.jo/EN/Pages/Visa_E_Applications). This includes travel for the purposes of work or study.

### Registering with the local authorities

If you are planning to remain in Jordan for more than 14 days, you must report to the police station with a residency extension office that is nearest to your place of residence. You will be required to provide your biometrics (fingerprint and iris scan).

Failure to report within 14 days of arrival will result in a fine of JOD 200 to be paid upon leaving the country. This rule applies to anyone who entered Jordan after 1 October 2025, but not to holders of annual residency visas, tourists, pilgrims, or transit visa holders.

## Land border crossings

There are three land border crossings from Israel and Palestine.  They are open most days from 8 or 8.30am. Closures may happen at no notice, including over the weekend.

* King Hussein/Allenby Bridge
* The Northern (Sheikh Hussein/Jordan River Crossing) crossing
* The Southern (Wadi Araba/Yitzhak Rabin) crossing

Those traveling from Israel or Palestine should refer to [Israel’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) and [Palestine’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/palestine).

The King Hussein Bridge/Allenby crossing is not an international crossing between Jordan and Palestine or Israel. You cannot enter Jordan using the King Hussein Bridge/Allenby crossing without getting a visa beforehand. You can get a visa from the [Jordanian Ministry of Interior](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf).

If you are travelling on a British passport, you do not need to prebook to leave Jordan via the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge.

If you have entered Jordan using a non-British passport you may need to prebook to enter Israel or Palestine via the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge. Bookings are made via [Jordan Express Tourist Transport Company](https://jett-khb.com.jo/about), at busy times they can be booked up several days in advance.

If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel or Palestine, you can get a multiple-entry visa before you travel from the [Jordanian Ministry of Interior](https://eservices.moi.gov.jo/MOI_EVISA/faces/Pages/Runnables/login.jsf). You should also check the [Israel travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) before using the land borders to enter Israel.

On the Jordanian side, board guards will stamp passports unless the traveller requests otherwise and tells them before they hand over their passport.

Photography and videography are not permitted on the border crossings.

## Departure tax

You must pay a departure tax of 10 Jordanian dinars in cash at all land border crossings. There are usually ATMs at the border.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Jordan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/115/jordan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Health screening

### HIV test

You must have a HIV test if you are staying in Jordan for more than 30 days. It costs 20 Jordanian dinars to get the health certificate.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Jordan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Drones

You must [apply for approval to take a drone](https://carc.gov.jo/en/drones) into Jordan at least 10 working days before you travel. If you have not received a permit before you arrive, the authorities will hold your drone at the airport. You can collect it when you leave Jordan.
