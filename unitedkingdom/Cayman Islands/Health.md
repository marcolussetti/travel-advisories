# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the Cayman Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/45/cayman-islands#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the Cayman Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/45/cayman-islands), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in the Cayman Islands

There are 3 well-equipped hospitals on Grand Cayman, 2 in the capital, George Town, and one in the Eastern part of the island. A smaller facility, Faith Hospital, on Cayman Brac, can cope with most routine medical and dental problems.

Treatment is expensive and more serious cases will normally be stabilised in the Cayman Islands before being transferred to the USA.

### Hospital treatment

For non-urgent medical assistance, contact:

* Grand Cayman Hospital: (345) 949 8600
* Cayman Brac Hospital: (345) 948 2225
