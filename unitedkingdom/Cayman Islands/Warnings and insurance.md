Latest update:
:   New information about Hurricane Melissa ('Warnings and insurance' page).

The Cayman Islands is a British Overseas Territory, so there is no British Embassy, and the Cayman Islands authorities will support you if you need help.

## Hurricane Melissa

We are closely monitoring Hurricane Melissa. We advise those in the Cayman Islands to monitor local and international weather updates, including from the [Cayman Islands Weather Forecast Service Provider - CINWS](https://www.weather.gov.ky/) and the [US National Hurricane Centre](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=7), and follow the guidance of local authorities. British nationals on package holidays should contact their travel provider for advice.

Those in Cayman should also register with the [National Emergency Notification System](https://caymanprepared.ky/nens) (NENS), the Hazard Management Cayman Islands’ emergency alert tool for further updates.
