# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Cayman Islands’ current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the Cayman Islands set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, check the [Cayman Islands Customs and Border Control](https://cbc.gov.ky/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter the Cayman Islands, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

You can enter the Cayman Islands [for up to 30 days without a UK passport](https://www.cbc.gov.ky/index.php/travel/entry-and-landing-requirements) if you have photo identification and a certified copy of a UK birth certificate, or a naturalisation certificate.

## Visa requirements

You can visit the Cayman Islands without a visa for up to 6 months, for business or tourism.

After 6 months, you can [apply for an extension](https://www.cbc.gov.ky/index.php/travel/visitor-extensions-2) – applications are considered on a case-by-case basis.

To work, study or request residency, check the [Cayman Islands immigration requirements](https://www.gov.ky/immigration). It is not usually possible to apply for a work permit while you are in the country as a visitor.

### Checks at border control

Border officials may ask to see a return or onward ticket and proof of funds.

## Vaccine requirements

## Customs rules

Check customs regulations if you want to import pets, plants, or animal or plant products.

It is illegal to take some marine and animal specimens from the islands. If in doubt, check with the customs office before buying such items.

### Taking money into the Cayman Islands
