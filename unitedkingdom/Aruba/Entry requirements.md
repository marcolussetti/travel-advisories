# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Aruba’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

Aruba is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It sets and enforces its own entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Netherlands Embassy in the UK](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/contact/embassies-consulates-general/united-kingdom/embassy-london).

## Passport validity requirements

If you’re visiting Aruba, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Aruba for up to 3 months without a visa.

To stay longer (or to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the [Aruban government’s entry requirements](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/caribbean-visa).

It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

You must complete an [embarkation card](https://edcardaruba.aw/) up to 7 days before you arrive. You’ll need to show proof of approval to travel to your airline before you can fly.
