# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Netherlands’ current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the Netherlands set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Netherlands Embassy in the UK](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/contact/embassies-consulates-general/united-kingdom/embassy-london).

## Passport validity requirements

The Netherlands follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes the Netherlands, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* or for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in the Netherlands](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-the-netherlands-for-work) are different.

If you are travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

See [passport stamping if you live in the Netherlands](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-netherlands#passports-and-travel).

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must meet the Dutch government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need on the [Dutch government website](https://www.government.nl/topics/immigration-to-the-netherlands/question-and-answer/which-visa-do-i-need-to-travel-to-the-netherlands).

If you’re in the Netherlands with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

## New Schengen entry requirements

The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.
