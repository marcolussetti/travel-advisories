# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 995 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Singapore](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/196/singapore#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Singapore](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/196/singapore), including :

* Zika virus
* dengue
* chikungunya

[Hand, foot and mouth disease](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/44/hfmd) is common in Singapore with more serious outbreaks from time to time. Young children are particularly at risk.

### Air quality

From June to October Singapore can experience high levels of pollution (haze) from land clearance fires in Indonesia. The haze can cause disruption to local and regional air travel and may have an impact on public health. Monitor the [Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) updates and health advisories](http://www.haze.gov.sg/) from the Singapore government.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Check to see whether you need approval from the Health Sciences Authority to [bring in medication from the UK](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/personal-medication).

Not all medicines from the UK are available in Singapore. Make sure you have a prescription from your GP and check with a doctor in Singapore who may be able to issue a prescription for a local equivalent. See the [HCI Directory](https://www.hcidirectory.gov.sg/hcidirectory/) for a listing of licensed healthcare institutions.

## Healthcare in Singapore

Healthcare in Singapore is of a high quality and expensive. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals, whether private or public, will have English-speaking medical staff.

Take enough medication for your stay and carry it in your hand baggage. Make sure you have travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and possible medical repatriation.
