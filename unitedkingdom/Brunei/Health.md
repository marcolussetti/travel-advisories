# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have an existing health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 991 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Brunei](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/35/brunei#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Brunei](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/35/brunei).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Most branded pharmaceuticals are readily available, though some items available without a prescription in the UK may need a doctor’s prescription in Brunei.

## Healthcare in Brunei

Standards of healthcare in Brunei are generally acceptable, though basic hospital supplies can occasionally run low. There are 2 significant medical facilities, the Government General Hospital (RIPAS) in Bandar Seri Begawan and the private Jerudong Park Medical Centre (JPMC).

You may need medical evacuation to Singapore if there are complications. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
