# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Brunei’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Brunei set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Brunei High Commission in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.bn/uk-london/SitePages/Home.aspx).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Brunei, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It must not be damaged or have any pages missing. If your passport does not meet these conditions, you may be refused entry and detained.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

 You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

British citizen passport holders may enter Brunei for up to 90 days without a visa as a visitor. If you have another type of British nationality, check visa requirements with [Brunei immigration authorities](http://www.immigration.gov.bn/en/SitePages/Visa,%20Visit%20and%20Diplomatic.aspx).

To stay longer or if you’re travelling for work, study, business travel or other reasons, you must meet the Brunei government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the [Brunei High Commission in the UK](https://www.mfa.gov.bn/uk-london/SitePages/Home.aspx).

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure you get your passport stamped when you enter Brunei. Do not overstay your visa or violate the terms of entry. Penalties include detention and caning.

## Dual nationality

Brunei does not recognise the dual nationality of Bruneians. The immigration authorities can refuse your entry if you hold a Bruneian passport and a passport of a different nationality.

If you’re a dual national, you should use the same passport to enter and exit Brunei. The passport you use for entry will determine your nationality in Brunei. If you enter on a Brunei passport, you cannot access British consular assistance, as you will be treated as a Bruneian national.

## Declaration form

You must [submit an e-arrival declaration form](https://www.imm.gov.bn/) to enter Brunei. Do this before you travel as it may be requested at check-in. You do not need to complete the arrival form if you are not passing through immigration.

You must also complete the [Health Declaration Form](https://www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel#/user/login) before or upon arrival. More information can be found at the [Ministry of Health website](https://www.moh.gov.bn/).

## Land and sea travel

Check [border post opening hours](https://www.immigration.gov.bn/SitePages/Pos-Pos%20Kawalan.aspx) before you travel. They are not open 24 hours. Make sure your exit and entry stamps are correct before leaving the border post.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Brunei, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio vaccine, in some circumstances

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Brunei guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/35/brunei#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods and the amount of alcohol you can take into and out of Brunei](https://bdnsw.mofe.gov.bn/Pages/ImpExpProh-RestictionGoods.aspx). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

You can complete a declaration through the Customs.BN app or on arrival at the airport.
