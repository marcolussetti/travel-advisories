# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [BVI Immigration Department](https://bvi.gov.vg/departments/immigration-department-0).

From 01 January 2025, all travellers entering the BVI will need to complete an [online embarkation card](https://bviedcard.gov.vg/).  Applications can be made up to 72 hours in advance of arrival.

## Passport validity requirements

To visit the BVI, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

 Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

If you are a resident in the BVI, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months after the date you arrive.

## Visa requirements

You can visit the BVI without a visa for up to 1 month. The BVI immigration authorities will issue you with a 1-month entry stamp on arrival.

The Chief Immigration Officer can grant extensions of up to 6 months. You may need to show:

* proof of independent financial means
* evidence of accommodation
* plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay

For information about work permits or other immigration issues, contact the [BVI’s Immigration Department](https://bvi.gov.vg/departments/immigration-department-0).

The [Labour Department](https://bvi.gov.vg/departments/labour-department-0) handles queries about working in the BVI. If your work permit expires while you are absent from the BVI, you must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days before you travel.  This also applies to holders of work permit exemptions.

## Airport and ferry charges

If you arrive by air or sea you must pay an environmental and tourism levy of 10 US dollars on arrival.

There is a departure tax of 50 US dollars for all passengers, to be paid when leaving the BVI by air. This consists of:

* 15 dollars departure tax
* 5 dollars security charge departure tax
* 30 dollars airport development fee

The tax is generally included in the ticket price.

If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, you must pay a departure tax of 20 US dollars per person or 15 US dollars for residents.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s BVI guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/241/british-virgin-islands#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of the BVI. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

See [customs clearance rules for vessels entering and leaving the BVI](https://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/clearing-vessels).

A permit is required to import or export any plants, agriculture products or animals. There are several  marine and animal specimens that must not be taken from the BVI.
