# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 or 999 and ask for an ambulance.

You can also contact emergency rescue services on their local number, +1 (664) 491 7790.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Montserrat](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/153/montserrat#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Montserrat](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/153/montserrat), including:

* dengue
* Zika virus

If you suffer from asthma or other respiratory problems, you could be affected by airborne dust, volcanic ash and gases, including sulphur dioxide – SO2.

## Healthcare in Montserrat

Good healthcare is limited in availability. There is a small hospital and 4 district health centres. You may have to pay in advance to obtain medical services and it can be expensive. If you need specialist medical treatment, you may need to travel to a neighbouring island. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

Dental care is by private practice, which is only available in the evenings and at weekends.
