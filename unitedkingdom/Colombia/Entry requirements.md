# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Colombia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Colombia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Colombian Embassy in the UK](https://reinounido.embajada.gov.co/) (for English choose ‘Ingles’ from the drop down menu).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Colombia, your passport must be valid on entry. However, Colombian immigration authorities recommend your passport has an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Dual nationals

If you’re a British-Colombian dual national, you must enter and leave Colombia using your Colombian passport and Colombian identification card (Cedula).

## Visa requirements

You can visit Colombia for up to 90 days without a visa for business or tourism, at the discretion of the Colombian immigration officer on arrival.

You must be able to show an onward or return ticket valid within the 90-day period.

### Applying for a visa

Check the latest entry requirements and how to apply for a visa with the [Colombian Consulate General](https://londres.consulado.gov.co/) in London before you travel.

If you have a Colombian visa with more than 90 days of validity, you must register the visa at a [Migración Colombia office](https://unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia.micolombiadigital.gov.co/cedula-de-extranjeria/agende-su-cita) (in Spanish) or [register the visa online](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf) (in Spanish) within 15 days of arrival in Colombia. If you do not register, you may get a fine.

You may be able to extend your stay once you are in Colombia by up to 120 days by applying at the immigration office [Migración Colombia](https://unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia.micolombiadigital.gov.co/directorio-institucional/unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia) (in Spanish). As a visitor, you cannot remain in Colombia for more than 180 days in any 12-month period.

If you overstay your visa, you could get a fine, or be deported at your own cost.

## Checks at border control

Colombian authorities advise that you can speed up your entry to the country by [completing the ‘Check-Mig’ form on Migración Colombia](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/pre-registro/en/DatosViaje), although this is not mandatory. You can complete the form between 72 hours and one hour before you travel to Colombia. You will receive a confirmation email that you will need to show to immigration officials when you arrive.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

If you enter Colombia by land, sea or river, make sure the immigration authorities stamp your passport. If it is not stamped, you could get a fine when you leave. If the immigration office on the border is closed, go to the nearest office of [Migración Colombia](https://unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia.micolombiadigital.gov.co/directorio-institucional/unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia) (in Spanish).

## Travelling with children

Children aged 17 and under who have resident status in Colombia and who are travelling on a British passport need a [notarised letter of permission from any non-accompanying parents or parent](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/entidad/salida-de-menores-del-pais) (in Spanish). The letter must be authenticated by a notary or by a Colombian consulate. You can get more information from [Migración Colombia](http://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) (in Spanish) or by contacting the [Colombian Consulate in the UK](https://londres.consulado.gov.co/) (in Spanish).

## San Andres Archipelago

If you’re travelling to the islands of San Andres, Providencia or Santa Catalina, you must buy a tourist card from the boarding gate, on the day of the flight. You do not need one if you’re staying less than 24 hours.

## Departure tax

Departure tax is usually included in the price of the airline ticket, but check with your airline.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Colombia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from certain countries with a transmission risk.

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Colombia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/53/colombia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Colombia](https://www.dian.gov.co/) (in Spanish). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into Colombia

You can bring up to 10,000 US dollars-worth of any currency into Colombia. You must declare anything above this amount with the [National Tax and Customs Directorate (DIAN)](https://www.dian.gov.co/Viajeros-y-Servicios-aduaneros/Paginas/Inicio.aspx) (in Spanish).
