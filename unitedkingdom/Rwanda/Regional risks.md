## Rwanda-DRC border

See [advice for the Rwanda-DRC border on the Warnings and insurance page](/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda).

## Rwanda-Burundi border

Burundi closed the border to Rwanda in January 2024. There might be some tension near the border, as both sides have accused the other of cross-border raids targeting local inhabitants.

## Rwanda-Uganda border

Border crossings Uganda have temporarily closed at short notice in recent years. Be aware of the impact that short-notice border closures could have on any travel plans in the region.

## Cross-border additional risks

If you’re travelling near the DRC or Burundi borders, be aware of the risk of cross-border attacks and government security operations given the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC.

In recent years, armed incursions have occurred into south-west Rwanda:

* on 18 June 2023, 2 people were killed and 6 were injured when suspected militants opened fire on a public passenger bus on Nyamagabe-Rusizi road, in Nyungwe Forest, Nyamgabe District
* on 17 June 2023, a Congolese soldier crossed into Rwanda at Gisenyi and fired on civilians and Rwandan security personnel near the border, injuring 2 Rwandan police officers – the soldier was shot dead
* in 2022, artillery fire from the DRC hit Rwandan territory, close to the border in Kinigi sector of Musanze District in the north-west
