# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest information on [recommended vaccinations](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/187/rwanda#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Rwanda](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/187/rwanda#General_Information) including mpox.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Rwanda. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Marburg virus disease (MVD)

On 20 December 2024, the Government of Rwanda announced the end of the outbreak of Marburg virus disease that began on 27 September 2024. The outbreak was linked to contact with fruit bats in a mine near Kigali.

The last confirmed case of Marburg virus disease was reported on 30 October 2024. There remains a risk of re-emergence of the disease linked to viral persistence in body fluids of recovered patients and the potential animal reservoir in the country, so if visiting or working in caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, you should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including face masks).

Check the latest situation with local authorities before travelling. You can find more information on Marburg virus disease from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease), and [TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/799/marburg-virus-disease-in-rwanda).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Rwanda

Only limited medical facilities are available in Rwanda. If you have a serious accident or illness, you may need to be evacuated by air ambulance to Kenya or South Africa.
