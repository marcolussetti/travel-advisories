Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Rubavu District

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the parts of Rubavu District which are north-west of the NR2 road west of the NR11 road, leading from Nyamyumba to Mukamira. This includes the town of Gisenyi and the border crossing point at Gisenyi-Goma.

### Rusizi District

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the parts of Rusizi District which are within 10km of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including the Rwandan islands in Lake Kivu and Kamembe Airport.

## Rwanda-DRC border

Risks associated with the proximity of potential fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Rwandan side of the border, including Rubavu and Rusizi districts, Volcanoes National Park, Nyungwe Forest and Lake Kivu. International borders are often not well marked in remote areas, and you could unknowingly cross into DRC. You may see a presence of military personnel on both sides of the border. On 27 January, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire in Gisenyi.

See [Democratic Republic of the Congo’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) for more information. Keep up to date with developments through local media.

The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma could close at short notice.

## UCI Road World Cycling Championships

Rwanda is hosting the UCI Road World Cycling Championships from 21-28 September in Kigali. Several major roads will be closed between 7am and 6pm for the race. Large crowds will gather and watch the event each day. Pedestrian crossings will be available. Alternative routes to hospitals, hotels and the airport are open, but may take longer than usual. Monitor local news and official sources of information for the latest updates, including [UCI](https://ucikigali2025.rw/).
