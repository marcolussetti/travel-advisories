Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

## Rubavu District

FCDO advises against all travel to Rubavu District. This includes the town of Gisenyi and the border crossing point at Gisenyi-Goma.

## Areas where FCDO advises all but essential against travel

### Rusizi District

FCDO now advises against all but essential travel to the parts of Rusizi District which are within 10km of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including the Rwandan islands in Lake Kivu and Kamembe Airport.

## Rwanda-DRC border

Risks associated with increased fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Rwandan side of the border, in both Rubavu and Risizi districts. There are risks because of the closeness of the potential fighting. You may see a presence of military personnel on both sides of the border. On 27 January, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire in Gisenyi. The security situation in DRC near to Rwanda’s border is unstable (see [Democratic Republic of the Congo’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) for more information). Keep up to date with developments through local media.

The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma could close at short notice.
