# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 or 114 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before you travel:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mauritius](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/145/mauritius#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations)

See [what health risks you’ll face on Mauritius](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/145/mauritius), including:

* dengue
* Schistosomiasis
* Chikungunya

Stonefish stings are rare but can be fatal. Get urgent medical attention if you are stung. Many hotels stock anti-venom serum.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You can bring common medicines for your own use but you must carry a copy of the prescription. Tranquillisers, hypnotics, narcotics and other strong painkillers will require prior authorisation. You can check details with the [Mauritius Ministry of Health and Wellness](https://health.govmu.org/health/). If in any doubt, get advice from the [Mauritius High Commission in the UK](https://mauritius-london.govmu.org/Pages/index.aspx) .

## Healthcare in Mauritius

Good private healthcare is available but can be expensive. More complex cases may require evacuation to Réunion or South Africa. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

Private and state ambulance services are available, but the quality and response speed can vary. If you can, go directly to the hospital.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Mauritius](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mauritius-list-of-doctors) where most staff will speak English.
