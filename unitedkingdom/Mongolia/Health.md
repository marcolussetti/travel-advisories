# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mongolia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/151/mongolia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Mongolia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/151/mongolia).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Mongolia. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

The high levels of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter, may aggravate bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. You can check the levels for Ulaanbaatar on the [Real-time Air Quality Index](https://www.aqicn.info/city/ulaanbaatar).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

It is best to bring prescription medication and a first aid kit with you. Medical products in pharmacies are mainly from China and Russia, so you may not easily recognise what you need.

## Healthcare in Mongolia

There are no reciprocal healthcare agreements between the UK and Mongolia, so you cannot get free healthcare in Mongolia.

If you are injured or become ill in a remote part of the country, it may be a long journey to the nearest medical facility. Outside Ulaanbaatar, the standard of healthcare is limited, and doctors may not speak English.

At hospitals, you will have to pay 80% of the treatment cost in advance. Make sure you have access to funds and that your insurance covers:

* full medical expenses
* an air ambulance, in case you need to be flown home
* bringing a body home in the event of a death
* bringing your family home, if one of you is seriously ill or injured

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Mongolia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mongolia-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
