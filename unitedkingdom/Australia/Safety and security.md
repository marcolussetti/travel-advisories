# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Australia

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Australia.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. You should be vigilant, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

In December 2025, 15 people were killed in an antisemitic terrorist attack at Bondi Beach, Sydney.

In April 2024, several people were injured in a terrorist incident at a church in Wakeley, Sydney.

See the [Australian government’s national terrorism threat level](https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/national-threat-level/current-national-terrorism-threat-level).

## Crime

### Protecting your belongings

Take precautions to protect yourself from petty crime, including:

* not leaving your bag or luggage unattended
* keeping luggage out of sight in cars
* keeping valuables and passport in a hotel safe
* leaving copies of important documents with family and friends in the UK
* carrying a photocopy of your passport for ID
* being particularly careful at night in busy tourist areas

### Scams

There are many different types of scams targeting people in or travelling to Australia, including dating and romance scams, websites offering fake services or building repair scams. You can check current scams or report your concerns about a scam on the [government’s scamwatch website](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/).

## Laws and cultural differences

### Personal ID

You can reduce the risk of losing your passport by carrying a proof of age card – this could be a driving licence or a student ID. This is accepted ID for many services like opening a bank account or entering licensed premises.

### Smoking and e-cigarette laws

Laws on smoking and e-cigarettes (vapes) differ between states. The Australian government is reviewing laws, so the rules may change. You must have a prescription to buy e-cigarettes containing liquid nicotine. There are [strict rules on importing vaping goods](https://www.odc.gov.au/importers/importing-vaping-goods-australia).

In all states it is illegal to smoke in enclosed public spaces. Get local advice on any restrictions, and see [smoking and tobacco laws in Australia](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/smoking-vaping-and-tobacco/about-smoking/laws-in-australia).

### Alcohol

Some drinks served in bars in Australia can be stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.

### Illegal drugs and prison sentences

The Australian authorities act against anyone who imports or traffics illegal drugs. Prosecution can lead to a lengthy prison sentence and deportation.

### LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex marriages are legally recognised. Australia is generally open-minded about homosexuality, but there are isolated incidents of homophobic crime. [Visit Gay Australia](http://www.visitgayaustralia.com.au/) is a useful travel planning resource alongside [LGBT+ information from the Australian Human Rights Commission](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/lgbti).

Read more [advice for LGBT+ travellers](https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice).

### Mobile phones

The mobile phone network generally works well in cities and large towns, but coverage elsewhere can be very limited or non-existent. If you’re travelling to remote areas, check with your phone provider about coverage. You can use your UK mobile phone in Australia if global roaming has been activated, but making and receiving calls can be expensive. Many visitors prefer to buy an Australian SIM card on arrival.

You can use any Telstra public payphone to make free phone calls to Australian numbers. Free wifi is also available at some payphones around the country.

### Working holidays

If you’re in Australia on a working holiday visa, the [Fair Work Ombudsman](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/) website has information about:

* your rights as an employee in Australia
* how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment online – you can also call 131 394

Different tax rules and rates apply to residents and non-residents. Working holidaymakers are usually regarded as non-resident for tax purposes. This means they do not qualify for any tax-free personal allowance on earnings. Get guidance from the [Australian Taxation Office](https://www.ato.gov.au/).

See [information for people working in Australia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-australia#working-in-australia).

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

### Swimming safety

Rip currents are the main hazard for all swimmers and surfers. They can happen at any beach and can sweep even the strongest swimmer out to sea.

Follow guidance on [beach safety in Australia](https://beachsafe.org.au/surf-safety) and tips from [Surf Life Saving Australia](https://sls.com.au/).

British nationals have been injured diving into water that was too shallow. Make sure there is sufficient depth of water before diving, and always follow warning signs.

### Diving and snorkelling safety

Snorkelling accidents can happen and have sometimes been fatal.

You are required by law to complete a medical declaration for diving or snorkelling at a resort. For your own health and safety, you must be truthful about any medical conditions you have.

### Dangerous wildlife

Australia has many dangerous animal species. There are crocodiles, jellyfish, sharks, venomous insects, spiders and snakes in many parts of the country.

See Beachsafe’s [information on dangerous marine creatures](https://beachsafe.org.au/surf-safety).

### Walking and hiking

If you’re planning to walk or hike, research the area you’re visiting and prepare for the terrain and weather, including intense heat. It can take hours to get help in an emergency in the bush or national parks. There is advice on bush safety on each state or territory’s government website. See:

* [New South Wales](https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/safety_and_prevention/safe_and_secure/outdoors)

* [South Australia](https://www.police.sa.gov.au/your-safety/crime-prevention-and-security/safety-and-security-tips)
* [Tasmania](https://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=5576)

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Australia, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Australia if you remain a temporary overseas visitor. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to [update it to a photocard licence](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence) or get the [1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP)](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit) as well.

If you plan to stay in Australia and have a permanent visa, you can drive using your UK licence for up to 3 months. To continue driving, you must get an Australian licence within this 3-month period.

Driving laws and regulations differ in each state and territory. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. The penalties can be severe. You must always wear a seat belt. See the [Australian Road Rules](https://www.ntc.gov.au/laws-and-regulations/australian-road-rules).

You must carry your driving licence and passport when driving. Make sure you have sufficient insurance, including if you borrow a car from a friend or relative.

### Hire cars

Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.

If you’re hiring a car immediately on arrival, be cautious about driving. You might be jetlagged and tired from your flight. Take regular rest breaks at the many rest stops on the roads.

Hire car insurance often does not cover driving on unsurfaced roads. Check your policy before you set off.

### Road conditions

Australia is known for having large distances between towns and amenities.

To reduce your risk:

* make sure you have enough water before travelling
* tell someone about your plans
* check road conditions before starting
* stay with your vehicle if it breaks down
* check the weather forecast – avoid travelling in extreme heat or severe weather

Sudden storms and strong winds can make driving difficult.

Take particular care when driving on unsurfaced roads, 4-wheel-drive tracks and desert or beach roads. Northern Territory Police have warned tourists to stay off unsurfaced tracks in remote areas of Central Australia, following reports of stranded motorists.

### Driving in the outback

Prepare thoroughly if driving in remote outback areas, which can present unexpected hazards. To reduce your risk:

* take a roadworthy vehicle fitted with GPS and 2 spare tyres
* take good maps and extra food, water and fuel
* plan your route carefully and get local advice before you set out
* leave your route details and expected time of return with the local tourist authorities, police, your hotel or hostel, or friends and relatives, and let them know when you’ve arrived safely

### Driving on K’gari (Fraser Island)

Following a number of serious accidents, all vehicles on K’gari (Fraser Island) must not drive faster than 80km/h on beaches and 30km/h in towns. Four-wheel-drive vehicles must have no more than 8 occupants, including the driver. You must store all luggage inside the vehicle.

Avoid driving at night and be aware of beach hazards like ditches created by the surf. K’gari is remote and emergency services can take many hours to reach an accident. Carry a well-stocked first-aid kit and personal medication as there is no pharmacy on the island. The Queensland government has more [information on keeping safe in K’gari](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/kgari-fraser).

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to [extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

### Bushfires

Bushfires can occur in any part of Australia, including areas close to towns and cities.

Be aware of the risk of bushfires, especially at the height of the Australian summer from November to February. Bushfires can start and change direction and become a risk to life very suddenly.

Australia regularly battles devastating bushfires. Previous fires resulted in the loss of lives and property with many residents and visitors advised to evacuate.

Australian authorities have a range of online information and apps to help citizens and visitors keep track of weather and bushfire warnings. You should consider downloading weather and emergency information apps from the Australian or State governments:

* ‘[BOM Weather’](http://www.bom.gov.au/app/) – all-Australia weather forecast and warnings .
* ‘Hazards near me’ – New South Wales
* [‘VicEmergency’](https://emergency.vic.gov.au/prepare/#where-do-i-get-information-in-an-emergency) – Victoria
* [‘AlertSA’](https://www.alert.sa.gov.au/) – South Australia
* ‘[EmergencyWA’](https://news.dfes.wa.gov.au/media-releases-feature-stories/feature-story-emergency-wa-app/) – Western Australia

If you’re in or near an affected area, follow the advice of local authorities:

* [Australian Capital Territory Fire and Rescue](http://esa.act.gov.au/actfr/)
* [New South Wales Rural Fire Service](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/)
* [Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service](http://www.pfes.nt.gov.au/Fire-and-Rescue.aspx)

* [Victoria](https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/EPAAirWatch)
* [Western Australia](https://www.wa.gov.au/service/environment/environment-information-services/air-quality)

### Heatwaves

Extreme heat is a serious risk in Australia. See the Australian Red Cross’s [information on heatstroke and heat exhaustion](https://www.redcross.org.au/emergencies/prepare/heatstroke-and-heat-exhaustion/).

### Flooding

Heavy rain and tropical cyclones can cause flooding, including flash floods in some areas. You can get [flood warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/floods/floodWarningServices.shtml). Check [local media reports](https://www.abc.net.au/emergency/?nw=0).

Significant weather events can happen suddenly. Spillways, flood plains and drains can quickly become submerged.

The local authorities may issue stay-at-home or leave-now orders. Always follow the advice of local authorities.

### Tropical cyclones

Tropical cyclones affect some parts of Australia, mainly Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. The cyclone season normally runs from November to April.

Monitor local and international weather updates from the [World Meteorological Organization](http://severe.worldweather.org/) and the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/).

If you are in or near an affected area, follow the advice of local authorities.

### Dust storms

Dust storms happen regularly in Australia, usually only in outback areas. Follow the advice of local authorities.
