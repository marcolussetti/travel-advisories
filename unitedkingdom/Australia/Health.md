# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 000 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Australia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/15/australia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Australia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/15/australia#General_Information) including:

* dengue
* Japanese encephalitis and other insect or tick-borne diseases

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Australia

While you are in Australia, you can access essential and urgent medical care through the UK-Australia Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement. Find out more about [healthcare for UK citizens in Australia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-reciprocal-healthcare-agreements-with-non-eu-countries#australia).

Essential and urgent hospital treatment is free. There is a charge to visit GPs and receive prescriptions. You can recover some costs through Medicare, Australia’s universal health insurance scheme. You can [enrol with Medicare through Services Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements-visiting-from-united-kingdom?context=22481#a3).

If you’re not covered by reciprocal healthcare arrangements between Australia and the UK, costs of treatment can be high.

The standard of healthcare in Australia is very good. UK residents are entitled to limited subsidised health services from Medicare for medically necessary treatment while visiting Australia. These provisions do not apply to non-visitors, for example those studying in Australia. Other exclusions under the reciprocal agreement include pharmaceuticals (unless you’re in hospital), use of ambulance services and medical evacuations, which are very expensive.
