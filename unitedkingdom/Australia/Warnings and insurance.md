## Bushfires

Australian authorities have advised that there is an increased risk of bushfires for large areas of the country from now and throughout summer 2024/2025 . Be aware of the risks and follow the advice of local states and territories on what you should do to prepare for and how to respond to any emergency.

See our advice on the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/australia/safety-and-security#Bushfires).

## Tropical cyclone Alfred

Tropical cyclones affect some parts of Australia, mainly Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. The cyclone season normally runs from November to April.

Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred has been downgraded to a tropical low but continues to bring adverse weather to Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast, South East Queensland and Northern New South Wales. This could result in localised flash flooding and severe coastal hazards which could lead to transport disruption and power outages.

Monitor weather updates, follow the advice of local authorities and check with your airline or travel agent for any travel updates.

**Remember in Australia, the Emergency Services number is 000.**
