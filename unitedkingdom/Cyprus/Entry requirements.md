# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Cyprus’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Cyprus set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Cyprus High Commission in the UK](https://cyprusinuk.com/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Cyprus, your passport must have:

* a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)
* at least one blank page for stamping

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid British passport or [proof of right of abode](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can travel without a visa to Cyprus for up to 90 days. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

At Cyprus border control, you may also need to:

* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have enough money for your stay

The [requirements for working in Cyprus](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-cyprus-for-work) are different.

Cyprus is not part of the Schengen area, so:

* visits to Cyprus do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
* visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Cyprus
* Cyprus is not affected by the new Entry/Exit System (EES) that will be introduced in Schengen countries from 12 October 2025. You will not need to register for EES when entering Cyprus. Read more [information on the EU Entry/Exit System and to understand which countries are in the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-entryexit-system).

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left Cyprus (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, [check with the Cyprus High Commission](https://cyprusinuk.com/visa-information/).

Do not overstay your permitted time. You could be:

* questioned by immigration at the airport on exit
* put on a ‘stop list’ and refused entry for up to 5 years

### Entry requirements for the north of Cyprus

The Republic of Cyprus authorities will count time in the north of Cyprus towards the 90-day visa-free total. You can use any crossing point to move between the north and south of the island.

See a [list of the crossing points from the Cyprus Ministry of Finance](https://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/customs/customs.nsf/All/05AEEF243C9BFC8BC22572BF002D0A28?OpenDocument).

Only pedestrians can use the crossing points at Ledra Palace and Ledra and Lokmaci Street.

If you enter the Republic of Cyprus through the north (such as through Ercan Airport), authorities will consider you to have entered illegally. You could be:

* fined for illegal entry
* refused entry to or exit from the Republic of Cyprus
* prevented from crossing back into the north of Cyprus

For more information about the north of Cyprus, see [Regional risks](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/regional-risks).

### UK residents of Cyprus or other EU countries

Residents should carry residency documents issued by the Republic of Cyprus when entering and exiting Cyprus.

If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Cyprus.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Cyprus guide](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/61/cyprus#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Cyprus](https://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/customs/customs.nsf/All/0D56470143C54886C22572BF002D7648?OpenDocument). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking food into Cyprus

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Customs rules between the north and south of Cyprus

There are [controls on quantities and types of goods](https://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/customs/customs.nsf/All/05AEEF243C9BFC8BC22572BF002D0A28?OpenDocument) that can be bought in the north of Cyprus and taken across the ‘Green Line’ to the south of the island. This includes goods from the bicommunal village of Pyla in the buffer zone.

For example, the Republic of Cyprus enforces a 40-cigarette per person limit. The authorities can confiscate goods at the checkpoint and you could be fined.
