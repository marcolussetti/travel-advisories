# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Afghanistan

Telephone: 119 (police)

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.

## Support from FCDO

There is no British Embassy in Afghanistan and our ability to provide help to British nationals is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person.

The UK government cannot help British nationals who are in Afghanistan and who wish to leave. Anyone who wants to leave Afghanistan should do so by commercial means or through a land border. FCDO cannot advise on the safety of routes to leave Afghanistan.

FCDO has guidance on staying safe and what to do if you need help or support abroad, including:

* getting help if you’re a [victim of crime](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-crime-abroad)
* what to do if you’re [in hospital](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/in-hospital-abroad)
* if you’re [affected by a crisis](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas), such as a terrorist attack

For information about applying for a British passport, or to check on your passport application, see [overseas British passport applications](https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports) or [call the Passport Adviceline](https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/help).
