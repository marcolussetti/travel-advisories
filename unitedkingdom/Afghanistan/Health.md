# Health

Only very limited medical facilities are available in Afghanistan. There is no guarantee local health practitioners will be available.

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have valid and [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical treatment

There are limited public ambulance services in Afghanistan. The telephone number for the ambulance service in Kabul  is 102 and each province has a separate emergency number. If you need urgent attention, speak directly with a local medical practitioner and use local transport to get to hospital when safe to do so. Ambulances sent by hospitals may require payment or evidence of insurance before they treat you.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Afghanistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/1/afghanistan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Afghanistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/1/afghanistan), including:

* diarrhoeal diseases and other gastrointestinal infections
* measles and other viral infections
* respiratory tuberculosis
* malaria

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Afghanistan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. There are serious shortages of some medicines in Afghanistan.
