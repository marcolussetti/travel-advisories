Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan

You should not travel to Afghanistan. The security situation is volatile. Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous and border crossings may not be open.

There is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained in Afghanistan. If you are a British national and you are detained in Afghanistan, you could face months or years of imprisonment. FCDO’s ability to help you is extremely limited and support in person is not possible in Afghanistan.

For more details about the risks in Afghanistan, see [Safety and security](/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security).

## UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Afghanistan. There is no British Embassy in Afghanistan and we cannot give help in person in Afghanistan. If you are detained, the British government may not be informed.

FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any departure point within Afghanistan.

If you are a British national in Afghanistan and need help from the UK government, you can:

* call FCDO on 020 7008 5000 (24 hours)
* [submit an enquiry](https://www.contact.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/posts/afghanistan/british-embassy-kabul)
* contact us on [X](https://twitter.com/FCDOtravelGovUK) or [Facebook](https://en-gb.facebook.com/FCDOTravel)

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
