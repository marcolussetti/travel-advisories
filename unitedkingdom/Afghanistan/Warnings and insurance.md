Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan

You should not travel to Afghanistan. The security situation is volatile and tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have previously resulted in violent clashes in border regions. Travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous and a number of border crossings are not currently open.

There is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained in Afghanistan. If you are a British national and you are detained in Afghanistan, you could face months or years of imprisonment. FCDO’s ability to help you is extremely limited and support in person is not possible in Afghanistan.

For more details about the risks in Afghanistan, see [Safety and security](/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/safety-and-security).
