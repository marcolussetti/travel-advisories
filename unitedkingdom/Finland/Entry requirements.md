# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Finland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Finnish Embassy in the UK](https://finlandabroad.fi/web/gbr/frontpage).

## Passport validity requirements

Finland follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport if you need to](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew).

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes Finland, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in Finland](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-finland-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.

Until the Entry-Exit System (EES) is fully rolled out, make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit (read ‘New Schengen entry requirements’).

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At Finnish border control, you may also need to:

* show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must meet the Finnish government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or permit you need with the [Finnish Embassy in the UK](https://finlandabroad.fi/web/gbr/frontpage).

If you’re in Finland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

## New Schengen entry requirements

From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin roll out.

This means that when you travel into the Schengen area for short stays, you may need to register your biometric details, such as fingerprints and a photo. You do not need to take any action before you arrive at the border, and there is no cost for EES registration.

On your first visit into a Schengen country from 12 October onwards, you may be asked to register your details at a special booth before proceeding to the immigration desk. Follow directions from your travel operator or the staff at your port of entry. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area. Children aged 11 or younger will not have their fingerprints scanned but can be required to have their photo taken.

EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border.

EES will not be rolled out to all ports of entry at once, the numbers of passengers being registered at each port of entry will vary, and some destinations may take up to 6 months to fully roll out the new process.

Until EES is fully rolled out your passport will continue to be stamped, even if you’ve already been registered for EES. Once EES is fully rolled out, it will replace the current system of manually stamping passports when visitors arrive in the Schengen area for short stays and you will input biometric details every time you enter or exit.

If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or Eurostar at St Pancras International and you are asked to register for EES, the information will be taken at the border before you leave the UK.

## Travelling with children

To enter Finland with an adult who is not a parent or legal guardian, minor children must carry a [letter of consent from a parent or legal guardian](https://raja.fi/en/document-required-for-a-minor-to-travel).

## Travelling from Russia

All border crossing points on the land border between Finland and Russia will remain closed until further notice. Monitor the [Finnish Border Guard website](https://raja.fi/en/frontpage) for details of border closures with Russia.

The border crossing points for maritime traffic at Haapasaari, the port of Nuijamaa and Santio will be closed to leisure boating until further notice.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into and out of Finland](https://tulli.fi/en/frontpage). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking food and drink into Finland

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en) into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Restrictions on Russian vehicles in Finland

There are restrictions on vehicles with Russian licence plates in Finland. See [Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more information](https://um.fi/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/ued5t2wDmr1C/content/rajoituksia-venajalle-rekisteroityjen-autojen-tuontiin/35732).

### Taking money into Finland

Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.

See [guidance on declaring cash from Finnish Customs](https://www.suomi.fi/services/declaring-cash-when-travelling-to-or-from-eu-nations-finnish-customs/5dc6e849-7d54-4847-83bd-7094033c380c).
