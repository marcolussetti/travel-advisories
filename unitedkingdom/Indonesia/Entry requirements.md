# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Indonesia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Indonesian Embassy in the UK](https://kemlu.go.id/london/en).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Indonesia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Indonesia.

You can get a [30-day visa on arrival (VOA)](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/) for:

* tourism or visiting
* some business purposes or an official meeting
* procurement of goods
* official visits or government duties

The VOA is not suitable for all business activities or for volunteering. You should confirm the appropriate visa for your visit at the [Indonesian immigration website](https://www.imigrasi.go.id/wna/permohonan-visa-republik-indonesia).

The VOA costs 500,000 Indonesian rupiah, payable in cash or by card. It is valid for single entry only. You must meet passport validity requirements and have a return or onward ticket. Most of the [main airports and ports](https://kemlu.go.id/london/en/news/18631/visa-on-arrival-voa-for-foreign-travellers) issue VOAs.

You can also apply for a visa at least a week before you leave on the [Indonesian immigration website](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/). You will find options to apply for a multiple-entry visa or a 60-day visa.

Make sure your visa is approved before arriving in Indonesia, otherwise you may only be eligible for a 30-day visa on arrival. Online visas approved after entry are not valid and may result in overstaying penalties.

### All Indonesia Declaration Form

Before travelling to Indonesia, fill out the online customs and health declaration on the [All Indonesia arrival card website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indonesia-visa-overstay-and-deportation) or app within 72 hours of arrival. After completing the form, you can use the All Indonesia app to apply for a visa.

### Extending your visa or residence permit

The 30-day visa can be extended once, for another 30 days, at any immigration office within Indonesia. If you applied online, you can get the extension on the [Indonesian immigration website](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/).

Make sure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine of 1 million rupiah a day.

### KITAS extension (stay or work permit)

If you’re a KITAS holder with an expired stay permit, you can apply for an extension from outside Indonesia through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of your passport and proof of your departure from Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report your arrival within 30 days.

### Visa scams

Beware of visa scams by fake visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong visa. This could result in you overstaying and getting a fine of 1 million rupiah a day, plus possible deportation and a re-entry ban. Use the [Indonesian immigration website](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/) to get or extend your visa.

Visa scams are increasing in Indonesia. Some travellers have lost significant amounts of money. Others have been deported despite paying a large fee to an agent to get the correct visa or extension.

### Not following visa conditions

Using the wrong type of visa, or staying in Indonesia after your visa expires, is taken very seriously. It can lead to prosecution, detention and deportation at your own cost. The cost of overstaying your visa is one million rupiah a day.

If your visa will expire while you are in hospital or in detention, contact Indonesian Immigration before it expires to avoid any overstay fines.

You can find more [information about visa overstays, deportation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indonesia-visa-overstay-and-deportation) and how the British Embassy in Jakarta can help in these situations.

## Registering with the police

If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia, you must register your presence with the local police at the nearest police station. You could be fined 5 million Indonesian rupiah if you do not register. If you’re staying in a hotel, you will be registered automatically.

## Bali tourist levy

The Bali provincial government has introduced a tourist levy of 150,000 Indonesian rupiah (approximately £8) for all foreign tourists arriving in Bali. You can pay online or on arrival. See the [Bali provincial government website](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/) for more details.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Indonesia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Indonesia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/106/indonesia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Departure tax

Airport tax is included in the cost of all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport departure tax might not be included in the price of the ticket. Check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
