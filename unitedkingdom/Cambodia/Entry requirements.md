# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Cambodia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Cambodia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Royal Embassy of Cambodia in the UK](https://www.cambodiaembassyuk.org/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Cambodia your passport must be:

* valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive in Cambodia
* undamaged and complete – entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing

If you apply to renew or extend your visa from within Cambodia, your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the start date of that subsequent renewal or extension.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to enter Cambodia as a visitor.

Tourist visas are valid for 30 days from the date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you’ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements.

### Applying for a tourist visa

[Apply for an e-visa](https://www.cambodiaembassyuk.org/visa-cosular-services/apply-e-visa/) at least 4 days in advance (this website may not work in certain web browsers). You can also apply on the official e-visa app on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/evisa-cambodia/id1436702505) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ptel.cambodia_evisa&hl=en-US).

Check with the [Royal Embassy of Cambodia in the UK](https://www.cambodiaembassyuk.org/) for the latest information on fees, conditions and photograph requirements. If you do not get an e-visa, you can get a visa on arrival at airports or land border crossings. You need to provide a photo and pay in US dollars.

You can also get an extension of a tourist visa while you are in Cambodia.

You can be fined, detained and deported if you overstay your visa. There is no limit to this fine. If you overstay more than 30 days, you will need to leave Cambodia and pay the fine.

### Electronic arrival card

On 1 September 2024, Cambodia implemented an electronic Arrival Card.  If you are entering Cambodia by air at either Phnom Penh, Siem Reap or Sihanoukville international airports, you must complete and submit an electronic [e-Arrival Card](https://arrival.gov.kh/) within 7 days prior to your arrival. There is no charge for this.

### Business visas and work permits

Business visas are issued by the immigration department and are available:

* on arrival in Phnom Penh airport
* at the immigration department
* in advance from any Cambodian embassy

To work in Cambodia you need a business visa and a work permit. Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.

The Cambodian government strictly enforces these rules, so ask the relevant department for the latest advice.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Cambodia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Cambodia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/39/cambodia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Registering with the authorities

The Cambodian Department of Immigration runs an online registration app called the [Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS)](https://fpcs.immigration.gov.kh/login).

If you’re staying in a hotel, guesthouse or rented accommodation, make sure the manager or landlord registers you using the app.

If you are staying with friends or family or own your own home in Cambodia, you will need to register yourself, using the app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fpcs.immigration.gov.kh&hl=en) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fpcs-gdi/id1484912224). You need to enter a Cambodian phone number for your registration to be valid.

If you fail to get yourself registered, you may be unable to extend your visa if you want to.
