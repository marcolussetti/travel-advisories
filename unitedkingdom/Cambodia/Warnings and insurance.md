FCDO advises against all but essential travel to border areas with Thailand. Specifically:

* within 50km from the whole border with Thailand

### Border with Thailand

There are updated reports of fighting including rocket and artillery fire on 24 July between Cambodia and Thailand, spreading across locations along the border. Casualties have been reported, as well as evacuations of areas close to the border. Land borders/crossings between Cambodia and Thailand have been suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Preah Vihear/Khao Phra Wihan temple, the Ta Krabey/Ta Kwai temple and the Tamone Thom/Ta Muen Thom temple are currently closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

We advise against all but essential travel to the affected border areas.
