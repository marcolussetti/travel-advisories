FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km from the land border with Thailand.

## Border with Thailand

Heavy fighting along parts of the Thailand and Cambodia border, including the use of airstrikes, rocket and artillery fire is ongoing. While most military activity is focused in the contested areas, strikes have happened more than 50km from the border. Targets have been military but have also included infrastructure such as bridges.

Land borders and crossings between Cambodia and Thailand continue to be suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Preah Vihear/Khao Phra Wihan temple, the Ta Krabey/Ta Kwai temple and the Tamone Thom/Ta Muen Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

We advise against travel to the affected land border areas. All travellers to Cambodia should remain alert and follow advice of local authorities.
