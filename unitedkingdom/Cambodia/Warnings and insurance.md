FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 50km from the whole border with Thailand.

### Border with Thailand

In July 2025, Thailand and Cambodia fought along parts of the border. The fighting included the use of rocket and artillery fire. Tensions remain with reports of the latest round of gunfire on 23 September. Land borders and crossings between Cambodia and Thailand continue to be suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Preah Vihear/Khao Phra Wihan temple, the Ta Krabey/Ta Kwai temple and the Tamone Thom/Ta Muen Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

We advise against all but essential travel to the affected border areas.
