# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Malaysia. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/safety-and-security).

## Eastern Sabah coast

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to all islands and dive sites off the coast of eastern Sabah from Sandakan to Tawau, including Lankayan Island, due to the threat of kidnapping. This does not apply to the mainland of Sabah.

Commercial shipping companies have been advised to adopt heightened vigilance when navigating the Sulu and Celebes seas. Most maritime incidents occur in the Sulu Sea in the area between Sabah (Malaysia) and Mindanao, the Sulu Islands and Palawan (Philippines).

The [Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combatting Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia](http://www.recaap.org/) (ReCAAP) advises all ships to re-route from the area where possible.
