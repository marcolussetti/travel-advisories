# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Malaysia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/137/malaysia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Malaysia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/137/malaysia#General_Information), including:

* malaria
* dengue
* rabies in the states of Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Sarawak

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Malaysia, including Mount Kinabalu in eastern Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air pollution

High levels of air pollution in major towns and cities in Malaysia may make respiratory conditions worse.

Forest fires in Indonesia can cause haze between June and October. Haze can cause disruption to local travel, regional air travel and to schools.

Monitor the [Air Pollutant Index Management System (APIMS)](http://apims.doe.gov.my/) updates and health advisories issued by the [Malaysian Department of Environment](https://www.doe.gov.my/en/utama-english/).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Malaysia

Government and private hospitals charge for all services. Private care is expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Malaysia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-medical-facilities/list-of-medical-facilities-in-malaysia) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Malaysia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-malaysia#healthcare-in-malaysia).
