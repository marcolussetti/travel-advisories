Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Transnistria

FCDO advises against all travel to Transnistria. There is widespread military activity in Ukraine, including close to some Moldovan borders. Transnistria is outside the control of the Moldovan government.

FCDO’s ability to offer support is extremely limited and will be more limited if there is military action on or near the Moldova-Ukraine border.

## Energy shortages

The Government of Moldova announced an energy state of emergency on 16 December 2024 linked to the cut off of gas supplies on 1 January 2025. Managed power blackouts may occur.

Please follow updates from local authorities and energy companies for information.
