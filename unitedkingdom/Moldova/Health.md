# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Staff may only speak Russian or Romanian.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Moldova](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/149/moldova#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Moldova](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/149/moldova), including:

* biting insects and ticks
* tick-borne encephalitis

### Water quality

Only drink bottled or boiled water.

### HIV risk

The UNAIDS 2010 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 12,000 adults aged 15 or over in Moldova were living with HIV. The prevalence was estimated at around 0.4% of the adult population compared to the UK rate of around 0.2%. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Moldova

State medical facilities in Moldova are generally poor. Private clinics and hospitals offer a better standard of care. If you are involved in an accident or taken ill, it is likely that you would be taken to a state hospital.

Most medical service providers in Moldova will expect cash or card payment for their services at the time of treatment. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [medical facilities in Moldova](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moldova-list-of-medical-facilities-and-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.
