# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Liberia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Liberia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Liberian Embassy in the UK](https://www.embassyofliberia.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Liberia, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to enter Liberia.

### Applying for a visa

Apply for a visa to visit Liberia through the [Liberian Embassy in the UK](https://www.embassyofliberia.co.uk/consular-services/visa-application/). Your passport must have at least 6 months validity remaining when you make your application.

Once in Liberia, you can apply for an extension of your existing visa for a maximum of 60 days. To apply for an extension in Monrovia, you should visit the Immigration Office at Gbarngaye’s Town, 24th Street, Sinkor. You’ll need to take your passport and pay a fee of 25 US dollars.

If you’re staying outside Montserrado County, contact your local Immigration Office to get a visa extension authorised by the Immigration County Commander.

To stay longer you must [apply for a Liberian residence permit](https://lis.gov.lr/service).

## Vaccine requirements

As part of the visa application process, you need to provide a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.
