# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 511 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Barbados](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/23/barbados#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Barbados](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/23/barbados), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue
* chikungunya

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Barbados

The Barbados healthcare system is not as extensive as the UK. Queen Elizabeth Hospital can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may need emergency evacuation. You can [call the hospital helpline](https://www.qehconnect.com/contact-us/) to speak with a healthcare professional.

Medical treatment in Barbados can be expensive. Check private clinics’ prepayment policies, as they may not accept medical travel insurance as payment.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Barbados](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barbados-list-of-medical-facilities-practioners).

## Travel and mental health
