# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Healthcare in Sudan

The current conflict has severely affected health services and many may be unavailable, including [hospitals for British nationals in Khartoum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sudan-list-of-medical-facilities/list-of-hospitals-for-british-nationals-in-khartoum).

Medical facilities in the country are limited and medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for all but the most basic treatments. Make sure you have [adequate travel and medical insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There is a particular risk to public health in areas of conflict where immunisation coverage is poor.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Emergency services in Sudan have been severely impacted by the conflict and are often unresponsive.

If you need emergency medical treatment you should make your own way to hospital, if you can.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Sudan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/212/sudan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Sudan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/212/sudan), including:

* cholera
* malaria
* yellow fever
* dengue

TravelHealthPro has more information on [malaria in Sudan](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/212/sudan#Malaria).

### Other health risks

There are regular outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, measles and other diseases in Sudan, particularly in refugee camps. There is a lack of clean water and the inability to remove dead bodies means Sudan is at high risk from various diseases.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
