## Crossing Sudan’s borders

Sudan’s borders with [Chad](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/chad) and [Eritrea](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/eritrea) are currently closed.

FCDO advises against all travel to [Central African Republic](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/central-african-republic), [South Sudan](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan), [Libya](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya) and within 20km of the [Ethiopian](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ethiopia) side of the border with Sudan.

## Sudan-Egypt border

Significant numbers of people are trying to cross the border from Sudan into Egypt. There are 2 main land border crossings between Egypt and Sudan, at Argeen and Qustul. The nearest town in Sudan to the crossings is Wadi Halfa, 30km from border.

There is almost no infrastructure at these border crossings. People are waiting several days to cross the border, with limited access to food and water.

The British Embassy in Egypt does not have staff at the border. Our ability to provide help is very limited.

If you’re a British national planning to cross into Egypt at Argeen or Qustul and you do not have valid documentation with you, call the British Embassy in Cairo: + 20 (0) 2 2791 6000.

See our [Egypt travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) for entry requirements, including information on visas.
