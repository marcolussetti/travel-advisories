You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/sudan) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/sudan/safety-and-security).

## Leaving Sudan by a land border

If you’re considering leaving Sudan across a land border, check that the border crossing will be open.

Sudan’s borders with [Chad](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/chad) and [Eritrea](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/eritrea) are currently closed.

[Check the travel advice for the country you will be entering](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) to understand the entry requirements for that country and whether FCDO advises against travel.

## Sudan-Egypt border

Significant numbers of people are trying to cross the border from Sudan into Egypt. There are 2 main land border crossings between Egypt and Sudan, at Argeen and Qustul. The nearest town in Sudan to the crossings is Wadi Halfa, 30km from border.

There is almost no infrastructure at these border crossings. People are waiting several days to cross the border, with limited access to food and water.

The British Embassy in Egypt does not have staff at the border. Our ability to provide help is very limited.

If you’re a British national planning to cross into Egypt at Argeen or Qustul and you do not have valid documentation with you, call the British Embassy in Cairo: + 20 (0) 2 2791 6000.

See our [Egypt travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) for entry requirements, including information on visas.
