# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kosovo set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Kosovan Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Kosovo, your passport must be undamaged and valid for the duration of your stay. You do not need an additional period of validity beyond this.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Kosovo-Serbia border

The authorities in Serbia do not consider the designated crossing points with Kosovo to be official international border crossing points.

However, it is possible to travel from Serbia to Kosovo, and back again.

You cannot travel from Kosovo to Serbia without a Serbian entry stamp from Belgrade, Niš or Kraljevo airports, or one of Serbia’s other border crossings with:

* Bosnia and Herzegovina
* Bulgaria
* Croatia
* Hungary
* Montenegro
* North Macedonia
* Romania

You are likely to be refused entry without a valid Serbian entry stamp. You should take a route through a third country.

Border guards have denied foreign nationals entry to Serbia if they have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passports. We are also aware of isolated incidents where Serbian authorities have cancelled Kosovo stamps in passports of foreign nationals.

Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo can cause difficulties at border crossings with Kosovo.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Kosovo without a visa for up to 90 days, for business or tourism.

Officials may ask you to provide documentary evidence giving a reason for your stay or showing you have sufficient finances. They will issue a 90-day entry stamp, which is renewable for longer stays.

If you plan to stay in Kosovo for longer than 90 days, you will need to register with the [Ministry of Internal Affairs](https://mpb.rks-gov.net/f/45/Temporary-residence-permit-for-foreigners) for a residence permit.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Kosovo guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/121/kosovo#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Kosovo](https://dogana.rks-gov.net/Individs/Index?individId=1084). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
