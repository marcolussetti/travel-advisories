# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 94 from a landline or 194 from a mobile and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Kosovo](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/121/kosovo#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Kosovo](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/121/kosovo) including biting insects and ticks.

Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever is endemic in Kosovo. Most cases occur in the region around Malisheva (central Kosovo), but during the summer months other rural areas of Kosovo can be affected.

Mosquito-borne diseases are present, including West Nile virus.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Kosovo. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air quality

High levels of air pollution can occur in Kosovo, particularly in Pristina. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) website and check air quality levels on the [World Air Quality Index Website](https://aqicn.org/map/europe/).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Kosovo

The public health system in Kosovo is poorly funded. Hospitals lack specialist equipment and there is a widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials. Many doctors and nurses lack training in modern techniques and practices.

Treatment is also available at private medical clinics, which are of better quality than the public health system and are relatively affordable. A small payment in cash is required for treatment in the public health system.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [medical facilities in Kosovo](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kosovo-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
