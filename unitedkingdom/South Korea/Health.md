# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 119 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for South Korea](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/120/south-korea#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in South Korea](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/120/south-korea#General_Information), including:

* malaria
* insect and tick bites
* tick-borne encephalitis

Air pollution, including yellow dust pollution, is common, especially during spring months. Follow local media reporting and check the [Korean Meteorological Administration](https://www.kma.go.kr/neng/index.do) website. On days when concentrations are high, most residents will stay indoors or use face masks outside. It’s also important to drink plenty of water.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

South Korean customs authorities allow you to bring small amounts of medication for your personal use, if it is kept in carry-on baggage. Take an English language prescription from your doctor at home for both your prescription drugs and non-prescription medicines. Consult the website of the [South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety](https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/index.do) before you travel to South Korea.

## Healthcare in South Korea

Medical and dental care in South Korea is usually of a good standard, but can be expensive. Staff may not speak English. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

If you need to stay in a South Korean hospital, particularly if your condition is severe, the hospital may ask you to bring a guardian or ‘bohoja’ to assist you with basic care needs such as trips to the bathroom, washing and exercise. It is possible to find agencies who will provide a caregiver or ‘ganbyungin’ for a fee, but these caregivers generally do not speak English. If you know that you may need to enter a Korean hospital, you should try to organise a guardian such as a friend or relative in advance.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in South Korea](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-korea-list-of-lawyers) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in South Korea](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-south-korea).

## Doctor shortage

South Korea is experiencing an ongoing doctor shortage which could cause disruption and delays at hospitals nationwide, including at large hospitals with international clinics. Patients may experience postponed surgeries and cancelled medical appointments. Some hospitals are prioritising access to emergency care based on the severity of injury or illness, which may result in complications accessing emergency care. Private hospitals and clinics are generally less affected but may still experience some disruptions.

The South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) maintains an [online database](https://www.e-gen.or.kr/egen/holiday_medical.do?emergencyViewYn=Y) (in Korean) of emergency services at available medical centres nationwide.

## Medical tourism

If you are travelling to South Korea for elective treatment, such as cosmetic surgery or a dental procedure, consider that no medical procedure is risk-free. Make sure that your travel health insurance covers complications that may arise and repatriation to the UK if required.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
