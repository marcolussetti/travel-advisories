## Elevated Political Tensions

We are aware of heightened political tensions in South Korea. Large demonstrations are likely to continue following President Yoon’s impeachment and arrest. Protests are particularly likely in the areas around Gwanghwamun and the Constitutional Court (Anguk), and could also occur in various parts of Seoul at different times, including in the areas around the Seoul Western District Court (Gongdeok) and the National Assembly (Yeouido). Follow the advice of local authorities and avoid large public gatherings. See the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-korea/safety-and-security#demonstrations) for more information.
