# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Japan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/japan) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/japan/safety-and-security).

## Fukushima

There is a [restricted area around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/) where only authorised persons can enter. Areas where evacuation orders are ready to be lifted are still subject to some restrictions – for example, visitors are not allowed to stay overnight. Follow local guidance.

The Japanese authorities carry out comprehensive checks to monitor radiation in the area around Fukushima Daiichi and to monitor possible [contamination of water](http://radioactivity.nsr.go.jp/en/) and [food and produce](https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/food_safety/index.html). They impose strict controls where necessary.

Although the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi site and full clean-up of the surrounding area will take many years, the risks are gradually declining.

## Noto Peninsula

A series of earthquakes hit the Noto Peninsula on 1 January, causing a minor tsunami and fires in various parts of Ishikawa Prefecture. Infrastructure damage was extensive, and some transport links remain disrupted. Take care in affected areas and follow local guidance.
