# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Iceland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Icelandic Embassy in the UK](https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-of-iceland-in-london/).

## Passport validity requirements

Iceland follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can travel to the Schengen area, which includes Iceland, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The requirements for [working in Iceland](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-iceland-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

Until the Entry-Exit System (EES) is fully rolled out, make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit (read ‘New Schengen entry requirements’).

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At Icelandic border control, you may also need to:

* show a return or onward ticket
* show you have enough money for your stay

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, to work or study, or for other reasons, you must meet the Icelandic entry requirements. Check what type of visa or work permit you need with the [Icelandic Directorate of Immigration](https://island.is/en/o/directorate-of-immigration).

If you‘re in Iceland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

## New Schengen entry requirements

The European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) is being rolled out.

EES checks are being introduced in a phased way across external borders, with full operation expected from 10 April 2026.

This means that when you travel into the Schengen area for short stays, you may need to register your biometric details, such as fingerprints and a photo. You do not need to take any action before you arrive at the border, and there is no cost for EES registration.

On your first visit into a Schengen country, you may be asked to register your details at a special booth before proceeding to the immigration desk. Follow directions from your travel operator or the staff at your port of entry. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area. Children aged 11 or younger will not have their fingerprints scanned but can be required to have their photo taken.

EES may take each passenger a few minutes extra to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border.

Until EES is fully rolled out your passport will continue to be stamped, even if you’ve already been registered for EES. Once EES is fully rolled out, it will replace the current system of manually stamping passports when visitors arrive in the Schengen area for short stays and you will input biometric details every time you enter or exit.

If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or Eurostar at St Pancras International and you are asked to register for EES, the information will be taken at the border before you leave the UK.

Your digital EES record is valid for 3 years. If you enter the Schengen area again during this time, you will still only need to provide a fingerprint or photo at the border, when you enter and exit.

### Whale products

It is illegal to import whale products from Iceland into the UK. You could get a fine of up to £5,000 or a prison sentence.

### Taking money into or out of Iceland

You must declare if you’re carrying any currency worth 10,000 euros or more.

### Taking food and drink into Iceland

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into Iceland](https://www.mast.is/en/travel). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
