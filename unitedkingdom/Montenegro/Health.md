# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 124 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Montenegro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/152/montenegro#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

 See what [health risks you’ll face in Montenegro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/152/montenegro), including:

* biting insects and ticks
* tick-borne encephalitis

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Montenegro. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-and-travel).

## Healthcare in Montenegro

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Montenegro](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-montenegro) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards

Montenegro recognises the Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC).

You will need to take your British passport and GHIC to a local office of the [Montenegrin Health Insurance Fund](https://fzocg.me/podrucne-jedinice/) (in Montenegrin) to request a certificate of entitlement to medical care. You need this in advance of medical treatment, or as soon as possible after an urgent admission to hospital. If you do not have a certificate, the hospital will charge for the treatment and paid bills will not be reimbursed.

Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Montenegrin nationals. You’ll have to pay for your prescribed medicines and for other medical treatment.

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* what special conditions apply in Montenegro

A GHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC does not cover.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Montenegro](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-montenegro#health).
