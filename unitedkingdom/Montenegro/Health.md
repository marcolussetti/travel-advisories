# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Montenegro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/152/montenegro#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

 See what [health risks you’ll face in Montenegro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/152/montenegro), including:

* biting insects and ticks
* tick-borne encephalitis

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Montenegro. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Healthcare in Montenegro

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Montenegro](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-montenegro) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards

Montenegro recognises the Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* what special conditions apply in Montenegro

A GHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC does not cover.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Montenegro](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-montenegro#health).

## Accessing emergency medical treatment

The UK has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Montenegro, enabling British nationals to receive free emergency treatment in Montenegro. You must have a valid British passport and the GHIC to apply for a certificate of entitlement from the [Montenegrin Health Insurance Fund](https://fzocg.me/podrucne-jedinice/), to access free or subsidised medical care at state run medical facilities. You must apply for a certificate in advance or as soon as possible after an urgent admission to hospital. Further details on applying for a Montenegrin Health Insurance Fund can be found in the [Living in Montenegro](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-montenegro#healthcare-in-montenegro) guide.

If you do not have a certificate, you will have to pay for the treatment and paid bills cannot be reimbursed.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travel-and-mental-health)
