# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Montenegrin Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.me/en/diplomatic-missions/embassies-and-consulates-of-montenegro/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland).

The authorities may close land border crossings at short notice.

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Montenegro, your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Montenegro without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

If you are travelling to Montenegro without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Montenegro within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.

Montenegro is not part of the [Schengen area](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en), so:

* visits to Montenegro do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
* visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Montenegro

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

The dated entry stamp helps avoid any problems about the length of your stay in the country.

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must meet the Montenegrin government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you may need with the [Montenegrin Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.me/en/diplomatic-missions/embassies-and-consulates-of-montenegro/united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland).

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Montenegro guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/152/montenegro#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Registering with the authorities

All visitors to Montenegro must [be registered with the local tourism office or police](https://www.montenegro.travel/en/plan-your-stay-in-montenegro/how-can-you-journey-to-us/conditions-for-entering-montenegro) in the town or city where they’re staying.

If you’re staying in a hotel or in some holiday lets, the staff or the owner will register you. If you’re staying with family or friends, or in rented accommodation, make sure you register within 24 hours of arrival in Montenegro.

If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.

## Entry by sea

If you are sailing to Montenegro, enter only at a designated port or harbour. If this is not possible, contact the [local harbour master](https://www.luckekapetanije.me/) (in Montenegrin) or the police before entering.

## Customs rules

Declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment or anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking pets into Montenegro

Montenegro accepts pet passports. You can bring up to 5 pets, as long as they meet [medical and other requirements](https://www.montenegro.travel/en/plan-your-stay-in-montenegro/how-can-you-journey-to-us/conditions-for-entering-montenegro).

### Taking food into Montenegro

You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into Montenegro. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
