# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Samoa](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/188/samoa#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Samoa](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/188/samoa), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue take [precautions against being bitten by mosquitos](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance)

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Samoa

If you have a medical emergency, evacuation to Australia, New Zealand or Hawaii is likely to be the only option for treatment.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
