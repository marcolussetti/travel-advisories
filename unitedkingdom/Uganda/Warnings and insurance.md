## Presidential and Parliamentary elections

Presidential and Parliamentary elections took place in Uganda on 15 January 2026. Results are due to be announced on or before 17 January.

Previous election campaigns and result announcements have led to protests and violence, including fatalities. There are some current reports of violent incidents, including in Kampala.

Stay away from political gatherings and large crowds and monitor local media to see when and where major protests are likely. Follow local news and the instructions of local authorities.

The Uganda Communications Commission announced the temporary suspension of public internet access, sale and registration of new simcards, and outbound data roaming services from 6pm local time on 13 January. There is likely to be an indefinite internet outage from this time.

Make a note of important phone numbers including your airline, travel operator, insurance company and the FCDO’s consular assistance number in case the internet is not accessible.

Consular assistance can be reached 24/7 on +256 (0) 312 312 000 or +44 (0) 20 7008 5000.
