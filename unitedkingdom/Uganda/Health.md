# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Medical help at the scene of an accident is likely to be limited, particularly outside Kampala.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [recommended vaccines for Uganda](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/231/uganda#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Uganda](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/231/uganda#General_Information), including:

* malaria
* yellow fever
* mpox

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Uganda. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Ebola

There are occasional Ebola outbreaks in Uganda. See [information on Ebola and similar diseases](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/68/viral-haemorrhagic-fever).

Some countries have heightened health screening for travellers from Uganda. [Check entry requirements](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/) for the country you’re travelling to or transiting.

Public Health England has [Ebola information for humanitarian or healthcare workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ebola-virus-disease-information-for-workers-in-at-risk-countries).

### Drinking water

Only use boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Avoid eating food prepared by unlicensed vendors or if you are concerned about kitchen hygiene. See [food and water hygiene](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/44/food-and-water-hygiene).

If you are staying in Uganda for a long time, store basic provisions such as drinking water and non-perishable foods at your accommodation, in case of supply problems.

### HIV and AIDS

UNAIDS estimate that around 1,400,000 adults aged 15 or over in Uganda are living with HIV. Read more about [precautions](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/29/hiv-and-aids) and [how to avoid exposure to HIV or AIDS](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/search?s=HIV&ge_srch=).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Uganda

Medical facilities in Uganda are limited, especially outside Kampala. Many popular tourist attractions have poor medical facilities. If you are seriously ill or have an accident, you may need an air ambulance. Make sure you have appropriate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Uganda](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uganda-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
