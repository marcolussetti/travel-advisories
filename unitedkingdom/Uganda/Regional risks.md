# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Uganda. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/warnings-and-insurance) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/safety-and-security).

## Kampala

Kampala is a busy capital, take the same precautions as you would in the UK. See [Safety and Security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/safety-and-security) for general risks.

In June 2025, two security operations took place in Kampala. On 3 June, there was an explosion near the Catholic Basilica in the Munyonyo area. On 22 June, security forces killed one person in a security operation in Kalerwe Market.

## Uganda-DRC border

### Western Uganda

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant group with links to Daesh, may target tourists and foreign nationals near the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). There have been several terrorist attacks in western Uganda, especially around the Bwera border crossing. See [Terrorism](/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/safety-and-security#terrorism).

Uganda and the DRC conduct joint military action against the ADF near parts of the Ugandan border, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of eastern DRC. Ugandan troops are present on both sides of the border as part of the operations.

Border crossing points could close at short notice.

There is also a risk of banditry and localised violence near the Uganda-DRC border. There were co-ordinated attacks by local armed men against police and army installations in Kasese and Bundibugyo in November 2025, resulting in multiple deaths including of one civilian. Local authorities deployed security forces to the areas and multiple suspects were arrested. While tourists and foreign nationals were not specifically targeted, the attacks were close to tourist areas. If you plan to visit these areas, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution, and follow the advice of local security agencies.

FCDO advises against all travel to the DRC provinces that border Uganda. See [DRC travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo).

### South-west Uganda

The provinces of DRC bordering south-west Uganda have a history of instability and violent conflict and this can flare up with little notice. FCDO advises against all travel to these DRC provinces. There is a potential for some spillover into Uganda. Take care when travelling in the area.

There are periodic clashes between DRC government forces and armed groups in the DRC close to the Ugandan border. The M23 armed group controls the Bunagana and the Kitagoma-Buszana border crossings in Kisoro district on the DRC side of the border. If you are in this area, keep your security situation under constant review.

Border crossing points have been temporarily suspended in the past following clashes, and could be closed again at short notice.

### National parks near DRC and Rwanda

Use reputable, registered tour operators and contact the [Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA)](https://ugandawildlife.org/) for up-to-date advice and information before you travel. Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park are in the extreme south-west of Uganda near the borders with DRC and Rwanda. It’s routine practice for security personnel to accompany tourists on gorilla-tracking visits in this area.

Some gorilla trekking operators cross into DRC. Avoid taking these tours. FCDO advises against all travel to the provinces of DRC that border Uganda, including Virunga National Park.

## Uganda-South Sudan border

Be extra cautious near the Uganda-South Sudan border. FCDO advises against all travel to South Sudan. See [South Sudan travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-sudan).

## North-east Uganda

There is an increased security presence in north-east Uganda in the Karamoja sub-region (districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Abim, Moroto and Nakapiripirit) due to cattle theft. Military and civilians have been killed during security operations.

Armed raids to steal cattle and robberies related to cattle trading, some resulting in killings, have been reported in Karamoja. There have also been robberies that have resulted in multiple killings in districts that neighbour Karamoja in the Teso and Acholi sub-regions. The attackers do not usually target foreign nationals, but you should always:

* stay alert
* be cautious
* avoid travel at night

Parts of the north-east are likely to experience flooding during the rainy seasons, from March to May and October to November. Monitor local media and only use suitably equipped 4-wheel-drive vehicles.

## Eastern Uganda

Travel to eastern Uganda is largely trouble-free, but during heavy rains there is a risk of landslides, particularly in Bulucheke sub-county in Bududa District near Mount Elgon National Park, a popular tourist destination.
