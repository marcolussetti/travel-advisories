# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 124 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/32/bosnia-and-herzegovina#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/32/bosnia-and-herzegovina), including biting insects and ticks.

High levels of air pollution can happen across the country. See [air quality guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease-details.php?dis=219).

## Medication

Pharmacies may not recognise prescriptions issued in the UK. Take your prescription to a local doctor who can issue a prescription to use in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Bosnia and Herzegovina

Medical and dental facilities, particularly outside Sarajevo and major towns, are limited.

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) do not cover Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ensure that you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bosnia-and-herzegovina-list-of-medical-facilities/bosnia-and-herzegovina-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.
