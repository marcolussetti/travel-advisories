# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Uruguay’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Uruguay set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Uruguayan Embassy in the UK](https://mapaconsular.mrree.gub.uy/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=item&item_id=250).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Uruguay, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay and have at least one blank page for an entry stamp.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Uruguay without a visa for up to 90 days.

To stay longer or take up residency in Uruguay, see [Dirección Nacional de Migración](https://migracion.minterior.gub.uy/) (in Spanish). For other information on entry regulations and living in Uruguay, contact the nearest Uruguayan Embassy.

## Travelling with children

If they travel on a non-Uruguayan passport, alone or with just one parent, children aged 17 and under who live in Uruguay and non-resident children who have been in Uruguay for a year or more need [written permission (‘Permiso de Menor’) from non-accompanying parents to leave the country](https://www.gub.uy/tramites/permiso-menor-edad) (in Spanish). Children travelling on a Uruguayan passport do not need permission.

The [Uruguay Ministry of the Interior](https://migracion.minterior.gub.uy/index.php/93-tramites/permiso-para-menor-de-edad/1365-permiso-de-menor) (in Spanish) has more information. If you’re in the UK, contact the [Uruguayan Embassy in the UK](https://mapaconsular.mrree.gub.uy/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=item&item_id=250).
