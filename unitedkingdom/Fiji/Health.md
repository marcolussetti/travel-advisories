# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Fiji](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/79/fiji#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Fiji](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/79/fiji) including:

* dengue
* Zika virus
* chikungunya

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Fiji

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Fiji](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fiji-doctors-and-medical-facilities/list-of-english-speaking-doctors-and-medical-facilities-in-fiji) where some staff will speak English.

Healthcare facilities are limited in range and availability. In serious medical emergencies, people are often evacuated to another country for treatment.

There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Fiji. Hospitals usually ask for immediate cash payment for health services.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
