# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 811 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Trinidad and Tobago](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/225/trinidad-and-tobago#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

The yellow fever vaccination is recommended for some travellers if visiting Trinidad – see [TravelHealthPro’s vaccine recommendations](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/225/trinidad-and-tobago#Vaccine_Recommendations).

See [what other health risks you’ll face in Trinidad and Tobago](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/225/trinidad-and-tobago#Other_Risks).

The 2022 UNAIDS Country Factsheet estimated that around 12,000 adults aged 15 or over in Trinidad and Tobago were living with HIV. Take precautions to avoid exposure to HIV.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Trinidad and Tobago

Medical facilities can be limited in some areas of Trinidad and Tobago. Private clinics can treat most ordinary problems, but medical evacuation may be necessary in more serious cases. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
