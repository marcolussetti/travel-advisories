# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kazakhstan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Kazakh Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/mfa-london?lang=en).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Kazakhstan, your passport must be valid for at least 30 days from the date you arrive and have at least one blank page.

If you have a visa for Kazakhstan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after your visa’s expiry date.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 days for business or tourism. You can make as many visa-free visits as you like, but you must not stay more than 90 days without a visa in any 180-day period.

To stay longer, to work or study or for other reasons, you must meet the Kazakh government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the [Kazakh Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/mfa-london?lang=en). Also see [visa information from Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/mfa/activities/3053?lang=en&parentId=3051).

## Applying for a visa

You can apply for a visa from the [Kazakhstan government’s visa website](https://vmp.gov.kz/en/). Check the validity dates of your visa and any restrictions before you travel.

British nationals aged 17 or over who apply for a visa or residency must submit biometrics (fingerprints) as part of the application process.

## Registering with the authorities

Your hotel or the person hosting you must [register your arrival with the Kazakh authorities](https://vmp.gov.kz/en/services/notice-service). They must do this within 3 working days of your arrival in Kazakhstan.

## Travelling overland between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Belarus

Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Belarus are in a single customs union. If you want to travel overland in your own vehicle between these countries, make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for your whole stay in all 4 countries. You can extend the import licence for up to one year by contacting the customs authorities in any of the countries.

## Customs rules

### Taking money into Kazakhstan

There are limits on [how much foreign currency you can bring](https://egov.kz/cms/en/articles/customs/rules-for-importing-goods) to Kazakhstan or take with you when you leave.

You must declare to customs authorities if you arrive in Kazakhstan with cash of a value greater than 10,000 US dollars. If you do not declare it the funds may be confiscated, and you may receive a fine.
