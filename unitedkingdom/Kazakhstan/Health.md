# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance. The operator answering may not speak English.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Kazakhstan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/116/kazakhstan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Kazakhstan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/116/kazakhstan) including biting insects and ticks.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Kazakhstan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Basic medications such as aspirin are available without a prescription. It’s best to bring enough medication with you.

If you need prescription medication while in Kazakhstan, you will need a valid prescription either from a local doctor or your UK prescription translated into Kazakh or Russian. Medications often come under different brand names, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If they are not available locally, it may be possible to get drugs to be couriered through a private clinic, for example, International SOS clinic.

## Healthcare in Kazakhstan

The medical facilities in Kazakhstan are not as advanced as in the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical treatment or evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation. Medical staff do not typically speak English.

FCDO has a list of [medical facilities in Kazakhstan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kazakhstan-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Kazakhstan](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kazakhstan).

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
