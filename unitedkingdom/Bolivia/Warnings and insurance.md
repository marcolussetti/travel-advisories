Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department including Villa Tunari and highway routes 4 and 24 that pass through Chapare.

The transport union in Bolivia has announced extensive road blockades across La Paz starting from Friday 19 December, including on roads to and from airports. These blockades are expected to spread to other regions and cities across Bolivia. This will restrict public and private transport services.

Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and do not attempt to cross blockades. Check [road status updates from the Bolivian road authority](https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/) (in Spanish) to see which roads are blocked.
