Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department including Villa Tunari and highway routes 4 and 24 that pass through Chapare.

## Road blockades

Extensive road blockades have been announced in Bolivia. Due to the blockades, the city of La Paz is cut off from Copacabana, Oruro, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Potosí and Sucre.

Avoid large crowds and demonstrations, and do not attempt to cross blockades. Check [road status updates from the Bolivian road authority](https://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa/) (in Spanish) to see which roads are blocked.
