# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 118 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccination recommendations for Bolivia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/30/bolivia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Bolivia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/30/bolivia), including:

* Oropouche virus disease
* Zika virus

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Bolivia, including in La Paz and the Salar de Uyuni salt flats. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

Some medications are currently in short supply in Bolivia. If you take prescription medicine, please ensure you have enough medicine to cover your stay in Bolivia.  You must bring your prescription with you.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Bolivia

The public healthcare system does not meet the same standards as the UK, and you may not be able to access the public health system as it is already overstretched. There are private clinics in all main cities that work with international insurance. It is very important to have travel insurance and access to funds, as you will need to pay up front to receive treatment.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Bolivia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bolivia-medical-facilities-and-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Bolivia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bolivia--2).

## Travel and mental health
