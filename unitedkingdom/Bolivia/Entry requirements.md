# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bolivia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Bolivia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Bolivian Embassy in the UK](https://bolivianembassy.co.uk/) (in Spanish).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Bolivia, your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least two blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Checks at border control

You may need to show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel or hostel booking and its address, at least for your first night in Bolivia.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure you get an entry stamp when you arrive in Bolivia, otherwise you’ll have to pay a fine when you leave.

If you enter Bolivia overland, make sure you get your passport stamped on both sides of the border, with an exit stamp from the country you are leaving and an entry stamp on the Bolivian side.

Bolivia no longer stamps passports on the border with Argentina, but you must [register your exit with Argentina’s immigration authorities](http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/transitos/) (in Spanish) who pass the information to Bolivian immigration.

The British Embassy cannot intervene in immigration issues.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Bolivia for up to 90 days without a visa. Border officials issue 30-day stamps, but you can stay for 90 days without any new stamp.

As a tourist, you get 90 days of visa-free travel in a one-year period. If you want to stay longer, check with the [Bolivian Embassy in the UK](https://bolivianembassy.co.uk/) (in Spanish) or the [Department of Immigration](https://migracion.gob.bo/index.php/) (in Spanish).

To work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you must meet the [Bolivian government’s entry requirements](http://www.migracion.gob.bo/index.php?idiom=ingl) (in Spanish).
Requirements include a police criminal record certificate from the UK, which you can get from the [ACRO Criminal Records Office](https://acro.police.uk/s/). If you need any documents from the UK, get them translated into Spanish and [legalised by the Legalisation Office](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised).

## Travelling with children

If only one parent or legal guardian is travelling with a child, you cannot visit Bolivia for longer than 90 days. If you stay for more than 90 days, the child will need a judicial permit to leave Bolivia with only one parent.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Bolivia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Bolivia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/30/bolivia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Bolivia](https://www.aduana.gob.bo/aduana7/content/viajero) (in Spanish). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. You should declare through [Bolivia’s 250 declaration form](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=12b180b923e5007f8fdbbcd8b267ca6f06c33b30efbe1b0caa06c551e0985ba7JmltdHM9MTc1MzY2MDgwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=360c5dd0-5880-67e2-0ccc-49fa59f966a1&psq=bolivia+250+form&u=a1aHR0cDovL2FuYnN3MDEuYWR1YW5hLmdvYi5ibzo3NDAxL3ZpYWplcm8vUHVibGljbzI1MC5qc3A&ntb=1) (link only works in Bolivia).
