# Regional Risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Bolivia. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/bolivia/warnings-and-insurance) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/bolivia/safety-and-security).

## Chapare Region of Cochabamba Department

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Chapare region of Cochabamba Department. This includes Villa Tunari and highway routes 4 and 24 that pass through Chapare. This is due to a high level of gang-related violent crime predominantly linked to the production and trafficking of illegal drugs.

Tourists are not usually targeted; however, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or by getting caught up in a security incident involving others.

It is difficult for the British Embassy to provide in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. The local authorities may also be very limited in the help they can provide.
