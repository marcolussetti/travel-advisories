## Shelter in place

We advise that British nationals in the city of Duqm and surrounding area shelter in place. Any British nationals currently visiting Salalah, or within 100km, should look to leave as soon as possible if commercial means allow. British residents in Salalah should follow the advice of local authorities, sheltering in place as required.

## Regional escalation
