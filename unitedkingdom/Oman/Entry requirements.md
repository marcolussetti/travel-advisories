# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Oman’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Oman set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Omani Embassy in the UK](https://www.fm.gov.om/london/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Oman, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

### British-Omani dual nationals

Oman does not recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Omani passports, the Omani authorities may confiscate one of your passports.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Oman for up to 14 days without a visa.

If you overstay or do not extend your visa or residency, the Omani authorities may fine and detain you. Fines can be up to 10 Omani rials a day, with a total maximum fine of 500 rials.

### Applying for a visa

To stay longer than 14 days or for work, study or other reasons, you must have a visa. To avoid the risk of refusal, it’s better to [apply for a visa online](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/) before you travel – you can select the ‘unsponsored visit visa’ option if you’re a tourist.

You can also get a visit visa on arrival at an airport in Oman.

## Checks at border control

At Omani border control, you must be able to show:

* a ticket for return or onward travel
* proof of your accommodation – for example, a hotel booking
* proof of your travel health insurance

## Vaccine requirements

You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from Rwanda, Tanzania or a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Oman guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/170/oman#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Oman](https://www.customs.gov.om/en). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking medicines into Oman

Some UK prescription and over-the-counter medicines are illegal in Oman. Carry a copy of your prescription if you’re bringing medicine. Check with [Oman’s Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.om/en/-/---276) well before you travel.
