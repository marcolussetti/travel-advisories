# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 110, +670 331 1044 or +670 723 3212 and ask for an ambulance.

Emergency medical services in Timor-Leste are unreliable. Make your own way to hospital if you can.

There may be other numbers for the areas you visit – ask your hotel or the local police.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Timor-Leste](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/68/timor-leste#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Go to TravelHealthPro to see [what health risks you’ll face in Timor-Leste](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/68/timor-leste), including:

* rabies (Oecusse exclave, Bobonaro and Covalima municipalities, and
  possibly elsewhere)
* chikungunya
* dengue
* gastroenteritis
* typhoid
* hepatitis
* tuberculosis
* malaria

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Timor-Leste. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Timor-Leste

Medical services in Timor-Leste are limited, particularly outside Dili.

In a medical emergency, it’s likely you’ll need to be evacuated to Australia or Singapore. However, medical evacuation is difficult because of the limited number of airlines from Timor-Leste. You should make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
