# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Morocco’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Morocco set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Moroccan Consulate General in the UK](https://www.consulat.ma/en).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Morocco, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you arrive.

Make sure [your passport is not damaged](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damaged-and-faulty-passports/damaged-british-passports-accessible#definitions-of-damage-or-fraudulent-tampering). The Moroccan authorities have denied entry to some travellers with damaged passports. Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Morocco without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism.

To stay longer than 90 days, you must request an extension at a Moroccan police station.

If you’re going to Morocco for reasons other than tourism, check visa requirements with the [Moroccan Consulate General in the UK](https://www.consulat.ma/en).

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure the border official stamps your passport. Some travellers have had difficulties leaving Morocco because their passport has no entry stamp.

## Arriving by private boat

If you arrive by private boat, you must enter at a [recognised port of entry](https://www.anp.org.ma/en/). It is illegal to enter through other ports.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Morocco, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a polio vaccine if you’re coming from a polio-affected country.

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Morocco guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/154/morocco#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Morocco](https://www.douane.gov.ma/web/guest/particuliers) (in French). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into or out of Morocco

You can take up to 2,000 Moroccan dirham into or out of Morocco. The dirham is ‘non-convertible’ – it cannot be easily exchanged for other currencies .

You must declare foreign currency worth 100,000 Moroccan dirham or more (about 10,000 US dollars) when you enter or leave the country. There is no limit on the amount of foreign cash you can carry.
