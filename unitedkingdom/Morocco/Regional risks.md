# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Morocco. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/morocco) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/morocco/safety-and-security).

## Western Sahara

Western Sahara is a disputed territory. If you’re in Western Sahara and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco, who provide consular assistance for Western Sahara. See [Western Sahara travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/western-sahara).

## Morocco-Algeria border

The authorities have closed land and sea borders between Morocco and Algeria. They patrol and closely monitor them. Do not attempt to cross the border – it is illegal to cross without authorisation.

If you are in a boat or jet ski, make sure you:

* know where the border is
* stay within Moroccan waters
* have enough fuel to return to shore

People entering Algerian waters illegally are likely to be intercepted and investigated.
