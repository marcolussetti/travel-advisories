# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 150 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Morocco](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/154/morocco#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Morocco](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/154/morocco).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Morocco. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Henna tattoos

Henna tattoos can cause a painful allergic reaction including swelling and an itchy rash in some people.

## Medication

If you have a UK prescription and need medication in Morocco, contact the nearest pharmacy. If they do not have your medication, they will ask you to get another prescription from a Moroccan doctor for an alternative medication. Pharmacies are open 24 hours in every city and district.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Morocco

Public health facilities in Morocco struggle to provide adequate medical care. Private clinics are available. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Morocco](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/morocco-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.
