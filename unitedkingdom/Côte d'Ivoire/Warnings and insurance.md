Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Borders with Burkina Faso and Mali

FCDO advises against all travel to:

* within 40km of the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali
* Northern Zanzan and Savanes provinces
* Comoé National Park

This is due to an increased risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps by terrorists based in the Sahel region, which includes Burkina Faso and Mali.

### Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the border with Liberia owing to the risk of serious violence by local militias.
