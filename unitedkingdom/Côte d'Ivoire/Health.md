# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 185 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Côte d’Ivoire](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/112/cote-divoire-ivory-coast#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Côte d’Ivoire](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/112/cote-divoire-ivory-coast), including:

* Zika virus
* malaria and dengue
* yellow fever
* Ebola virus

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Côte d’Ivoire

Medical facilities in Abidjan are of a reasonable standard but can be expensive. Emergency facilities are limited to a few major hospitals. Outside of Abidjan medical facilities are rudimentary.

Serious medical treatment could require medical evacuation back to the UK. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Côte d’Ivoire](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cote-divoire-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/cote-divoire-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.
