# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Côte d’Ivoire. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/cote-d-ivoire).

## Borders with Burkina Faso and Mali

FCDO advises against all travel to within 40km of the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali. There is an increased risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps by terrorists based in the Sahel region, which includes Burkina Faso and Mali.

## Northern provinces

FCDO also advises against all travel to:

* Northern Zanzan and Savanes provinces
* Comoé National Park

See [Safety and security](/foreign-travel-advice/cote-d-ivoire/safety-and-security) for details about terrorism risks in Côte d’Ivoire.

## Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the border with Liberia. This is due to the risk of clashes between local militias and security forces. Fatal clashes have taken place in and around this area in the past. If you travel to this area, seek professional security advice locally.
