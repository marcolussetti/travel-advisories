# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kiribati’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kiribati set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Fiji High Commission in the UK](http://www.fijihighcommission.org.uk/index.html).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Kiribati, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Kiribati without a visa for up to one month.

You must hold a ticket for return or onward travel and enough funds for your stay.

The authorities will normally grant you a one-month stay on arrival. You can apply for one-month extensions, up to a maximum of 3 extra months, from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration](https://www.mfa.gov.ki/immigration/) in Bairiki. Your passport must remain valid to extend your stay.

## Departure tax

You must pay a 20 Australian dollar departure tax at the airport.
