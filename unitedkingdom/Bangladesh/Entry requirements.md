# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bangladesh’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Bangladesh set and enforce entry rules. If you are not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK](https://bhclondon.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Bangladesh, your passport must have at least 2 blank pages and no damage.

See ‘Applying for a visa’ for passport validity requirements for visas.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet the requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure you get an entry stamp in your passport when you arrive. Immigration officers will check the date on your entry stamp when you leave Bangladesh. You could get a fine for overstaying.

At Bangladeshi border control, you may also need to show a return or onward ticket.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Bangladesh for up to 3 months, unless you have a ‘no visa required’ stamp in your UK passport.

### Applying for a visa

[Apply in advance for a visa](https://bhclondon.org.uk/visa) from the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date your visa starts. The visa starts from the date of issue, not the date of travel. If you plan to use Bangladesh as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple-entry visa.

The Visa on Arrival service continues to operate, including in the period before the national elections on 12 February. See [Checks at the border](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bangladesh/entry-requirements#checks-at-the-border).

You may be able to [apply for a visa on arrival at Dhaka airport](https://bhclondon.org.uk/visa-on-arrival). You must have a return ticket and proof of funds to apply for a visa on arrival. Visas on arrival are:

* single entry
* valid for 15 to 30 days
* not guaranteed – Bangladeshi immigration officers issue them at their discretion
* also available for business travel if you have a letter of introduction

If you want to stay longer, you can [apply for a visa extension from the Department of Immigration and Passports](https://dip.gov.bd/).

### Working in Bangladesh

If you are working in Bangladesh, you must get a work permit, and you’ll need an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before leaving Bangladesh. You get application forms from the [National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh](https://nbr.gov.bd/form/income-tax/eng).

### ‘No visa required’ stamp

British nationals of Bangladeshi origin may be eligible to [apply for a ‘no visa required’ stamp](https://bhclondon.org.uk/no-visa-required-old) from the Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK.

## Checks at the border

During the election period, you may face further checks at the border and be asked for additional documents such as:

* proof of an onward or return ticket
* confirmation of accommodation
* contact details

Check with your travel operator for the latest information before travelling.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Bangladesh, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio vaccine, in certain circumstances

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Bangladesh guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/22/bangladesh#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Bangladesh](http://bangladeshcustoms.gov.bd/legislation/travelers_info). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into or out of Bangladesh

You may need to [declare foreign currency or Bangladeshi taka](http://bangladeshcustoms.gov.bd/relevant/foreign_currency_declaration_form), depending on the amount you are travelling with.

You can cash travellers cheques at banks and airports. ATMs are available in most urban areas and accept UK cards. There are fewer ATMs in rural areas.
