Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Bangladesh

There is a threat of political violence and extremist attacks during the election period.  The security situation in Bangladesh may change quickly with no advance warning. For more information on the security situation, see [‘Safety and security’](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bangladesh/safety-and-security).

## Support from the UK government

FCDO’s ability to provide assistance is severely limited in areas where we advise against travel.

## National elections

Elections will take place in Bangladesh on 12 February. The election campaign started on 22 January. There is a threat of political violence and extremist attacks during the election period. Attacks could target political rallies and polling stations. They could also be indiscriminate. Remain aware of your surroundings. Stay away from large gatherings and other locations with a police or security presence. Follow the advice of local authorities. Plan carefully and make sure you have alternative plans if faced with any disruption.
