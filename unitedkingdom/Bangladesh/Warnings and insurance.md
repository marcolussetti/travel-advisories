Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Chittagong Hill Tracts

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as there are regular reports of violence and other criminal activity, particularly in more remote parts. The area is made up of the districts of:

* Rangamati
* Khagrachari
* Bandarban
