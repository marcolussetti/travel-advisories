Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Chittagong Hill Tracts

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as there are regular reports of violence and other criminal activity, particularly in more remote parts. The area is made up of the districts of:

* Rangamati
* Khagrachari
* Bandarban

## Support from the UK government

FCDO’s ability to provide assistance is severely limited in areas where we advise against travel.

## National elections

Elections will take place in Bangladesh on 12 February. The election campaign started on 22 January. Political rallies will become more frequent, with large crowds, an increased security presence and likely disruption to transport. Plan carefully and make sure you have alternative plans if faced with any disruption.
