# Safety and security

This guide also has safety advice for [regions of Bangladesh](/foreign-travel-advice/bangladesh/regional-risks).

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Bangladesh

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks. These attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, and places such as:

* public buildings, including restaurants and cafés
* public transport
* crowded areas
* religious buildings
* political rallies

Some groups have targeted people who they consider to have views and lifestyles contrary to Islam, including religious minorities.

Islamist extremist groups operate in Bangladesh.

The Bangladeshi authorities continue to disrupt planned attacks. Increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.

Remain aware of your surroundings. Avoid large gatherings and other locations with a police or security presence. Follow the advice of local authorities.

## Political situation

Bangladesh held national elections on 12 February 2026. Political rallies and demonstrations can quickly turn violent leading to clashes. During demonstrations and strikes (‘hartals’), there can be arson, violence and vandalism in towns and cities across the country, which can result in fatalities.

There have been occasional attacks against minority religious communities.

There have also been attacks targeting the police and security forces. These have included improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in major cities.

In July and August 2024, a popular uprising led to widespread violence across Bangladesh, with many deaths and injuries.

Be alert to quickly changing situations on the streets. Stay away from protests or demonstrations, rallies and large gatherings. If you see a demonstration starting, move to a place of safety. Follow the advice of local authorities.

## Crime

### Robbery and violence

There are reports of an increase in violent crime since the popular uprising in Bangladesh in July and August 2024.

Criminal gangs operate in Dhaka and other cities. Thieves often work in pairs on motorcycles or motorised rickshaws known as ‘CNGs’.

Potential threats include armed robbery, violent crime and rape.

Passengers using rickshaws, taxis, buses or trains are vulnerable to violent crime, particularly at night. Avoid using public transport if you’re travelling alone. See [Transport risks](/foreign-travel-advice/bangladesh/safety-and-security#transport-risks).

### Protecting yourself and your belongings

Be alert when using and carrying your phone in public and crowded spaces. To reduce your risk, do not carry large quantities of money or wear expensive-looking jewellery or watches.

### Sexual assault

There is a risk of sexual assault, including attacks on female foreign national visitors.

Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Avoid isolated areas when alone at any time of day. Be vigilant, particularly at night.

See [advice for women travelling abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad).

### Methanol poisoning

There have been deaths and cases of serious illness caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol in Bangladesh.

Alcohol is strictly regulated in Bangladesh. Non-Muslim citizens over 21 and foreign visitors may drink in licensed venues with permits, while it is banned for Muslims except for medical reasons. These restrictions often lead people to seek alcohol from unlicensed sources, creating a black market, which can use methanol, and increasing the risk of methanol poisoning.

Even small amounts of methanol can kill. It is not possible to identify methanol in alcoholic drinks by taste or smell. See [Travel Aware Drink Spiking and Methanol Poisoning](https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/spiking-and-methanol-poisoning/) for information about how to reduce the risks.

Seek urgent medical attention if you or someone you are travelling with show the [signs of methanol poisoning](https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/spiking-and-methanol-poisoning/) after drinking.

### Dhaka and Sylhet airports

Dhaka international and Sylhet airports are fully operational. Check with your travel provider for updates.

Risks at Dhaka and Sylhet airports include:

* theft, including passport theft
* harassment
* overcharging of taxi fees

To reduce your risk:

* avoid touts offering to carry your bags
* keep documents and belongings safe
* arrange taxis in advance

## Laws and cultural differences

Bangladesh is a majority Muslim country. Respect the customs and laws. Make sure your actions do not cause offence.

### Personal ID

Local officials may ask you for ID.

Carry copies of the photo page in your passport and your Bangladeshi visa. Keep the originals somewhere safe and leave copies with friends or relatives in the UK.

### Dress code

Both men and women should dress modestly to avoid causing offence. Women should cover their shoulders and legs in public.

### Ramadan

Ramadan in 2026 is expected to start on the 17/18 February and last until the third week of March.

Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Get advice on respecting Ramadan from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.

You should:

* check opening hours of shops and restaurants
* follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time, both for women and men
* be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening

### British nationals of Bangladeshi origin

If you’re a British national of Bangladeshi origin, the Bangladeshi government will consider you to be a Bangladeshi citizen, even if you:

* have never had a Bangladeshi passport
* were born outside of Bangladesh

This may limit the help the UK government can offer you. For more information on Bangladeshi nationality, check with the [Bangladeshi High Commission in the UK](https://bhclondon.org.uk/).

The [Bangladesh Police Expatriate Help Cell](https://www.police.gov.bd/en/expatriate_help_cell) offers services to foreign nationals, including dual nationals.

### Alcohol laws

You may need a liquor permit to drink alcohol in Bangladesh. A liquor permit allows you to drink alcohol in government-licensed bars. Check the requirements at your local district office and apply for a permit if necessary.

### Illegal drugs penalties

There are severe penalties for possessing and trafficking illegal drugs. Some drug-related offences are punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment.

### Prison sentences and conditions

If you break local laws, you may get a prison sentence, served in a local prison. Delays and inefficiency in the judicial system can result in long detentions until court hearings eventually take place. Prison conditions are far below UK standards.

British nationals detained in Bangladesh have the right to request access to British High Commission officials.

### Family law and property disputes

Family law in Bangladesh is very different from UK law. Always check your legal position when, for example, child custody is an issue.

The British High Commission in Dhaka cannot help British nationals of Bangladeshi origin with land or property problems.

### LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Bangladesh.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Bangladesh, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

You need a [1949 international driving permit (IDP)](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit) and a UK driving licence to drive in Bangladesh. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.

### Driving standards

Road accidents are common in Bangladesh due to:

* poor driving standards
* many unlicensed and/or unroadworthy vehicles
* large numbers of rickshaws on the roads

Driving at night is especially dangerous as many drivers do not use headlights or use undipped headlights. There is also a risk of robbery if you travel between towns after dark. Avoid driving alone at night.

### Cycle rickshaws and taxis

Cycle rickshaws used on main roads alongside traffic are not safe – they offer little protection if there is an accident.

Police are often unable to verify private hire drivers’ details, as driving records are often inaccurate.

Ride-hailing apps like Uber are available in Bangladesh. Uber drivers generally only accept cash payment. To make sure you get in the right car safely:

* wait in a safe location, not out on the street
* match the car’s registration plate, make and model (registration plates are generally in Bangla and appear on Uber in English)
* ask the driver to state your name
* check the driver’s photo
* share your journey details and consider enabling GPS tracking on your phone so trusted contacts can see your location

### Buses

The risks of travelling by bus include:

* extremely poor maintenance and driving standards
* lack of seat belts
* frequent traffic collisions, some resulting in deaths
* rape, sexual assaults and other crimes, sometimes committed by the bus crew

Avoid travelling by bus alone and at night.

### Air travel

Due to the security situation in Bangladesh, there are frequent disruptions to air travel, often at short notice. Stay in touch with your airline. Security checks at the airport can also be slow.

### Rail travel

The rail network is extensive but old and generally considered slow.

Rail travel risks include:

* frequent fatal accidents
* flood-damaged bridges and culverts in dangerous condition
* crime, including theft and sexual assault

On some trains, you may be able to lock first-class compartment doors. Make sure the door is locked if you’re travelling at night.

For information see [Bangladesh Railways](http://www.railway.gov.bd/).

### Sea and river travel

River and sea ferry risks include:

* dangerous overcrowding, particularly during religious holidays and other festivals
* falsified safety certificates on some vessels
* missing or inappropriate safety and survival equipment
* lack of communication equipment
* criminal gangs targeting vessels

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to [prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/extreme-weather-and-natural-hazards).

### Monsoon season

The monsoon season runs from June to September and can cause widespread flooding and travel disruption.

If travelling, you should check:

* access routes
* weather updates from the [Bangladesh Meteorological Department](http://www.bmd.gov.bd/)
* the advice of local authorities

### Tropical cyclones

There is a risk of tropical cyclones in Bangladesh. Check weather reports from the [Bangladesh Meteorological Department](http://www.bmd.gov.bd/) and the [World Meteorological Organization](https://severeweather.wmo.int/tc/in/index.html).

### Earthquakes

Around half of Bangladesh, including the cities of Moulvibazar and Sylhet, is in a high-risk earthquake zone. Other areas, including Dhaka, are at moderate risk. Tremors and earthquakes, usually minor ones, happen occasionally.

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about [what to do before, during and after an earthquake](https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes).

### Tsunamis

Bangladesh can be affected by tsunamis. In some cases the Bangladeshi government will issue tsunami warnings. Monitor local news and follow any advice given by local authorities.
