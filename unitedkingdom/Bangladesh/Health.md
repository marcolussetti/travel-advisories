# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) and access to money for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

If you suspect a heart attack, ask for a ‘cardiac ambulance’.

It may be faster to travel to the nearest hospital yourself if you have a vehicle.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccination recommendations for Bangladesh](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/22/bangladesh#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Bangladesh](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/22/bangladesh), including:

* dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can occur year-round but is more widespread during the rainy season, May to September
* other mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, chikungunya and Zika virus
* severe air pollution, especially from November to March

Dengue cases are increasing, including in Dhaka. See [insect bite avoidance advice on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You should carry any medical papers or prescriptions and be prepared to answer questions if police ask you about any medication you’re carrying.

## Healthcare in Bangladesh

Medical facilities in Bangladesh are poor. Routine tests and X-rays are unreliable.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Bangladesh](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bangladesh-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
