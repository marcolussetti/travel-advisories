## Period of national mourning

Following the death of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, Kenya is observing 7 days of national mourning from 15 October. Roads to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi have sometimes been blocked by demonstrations and the airport was temporarily closed due to a security situation following the arrival of the body of Raila Odinga on 16 October. It has since reopened.

There could be further disruption, particularly in Nairobi and Kisumu, over the period of national mourning. Stay away from political gatherings and large crowds and monitor local media to see when and where major demonstrations are likely. Follow local news and the instructions of local authorities.

## Risk of Kidnap

There is a high risk of kidnapping across Kenya. British nationals are seen as legitimate targets. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps and further kidnaps are very likely.
