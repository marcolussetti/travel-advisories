Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Kenya-Somalia border and northern parts of the east coast

Due to the risk of terrorism from groups based in Somalia, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:

* within 60km of Kenya’s border with Somalia
* Eastern Garissa County, up to 20km north-west of the A3 road, including the Boni National Reserve
* Mandera County, excluding Mandera West sub-county
* Lamu County, excluding Lamu Island and Manda Island
* Tana River County north of the Tana River, up to 20km north-west of the A3 road
* within 15km of the east coast between the Tana River and the Galana (Athi-Galana-Sabaki) River

## Risk of Kidnap

There is a high risk of kidnapping across Kenya. British nationals are seen as legitimate targets. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps and further kidnaps are very likely.
