# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Kenya

Telephone: 999 (ambulance, fire, police)

## Kenya Tourism Federation

Kenya Tourism Federation’s [Safety and Communication Center](https://ktf.co.ke/?page_id=857) provides tourist advice and emergency help.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
