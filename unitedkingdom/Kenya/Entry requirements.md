# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kenya set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Kenyan High Commission in the UK](https://www.kenyahighcom.org.uk/).

## COVID-19 rules

You do not need a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination to enter Kenya.

If you have flu-like symptoms when you arrive, you must take one or more COVID-19 tests at your own expense. If tests show you have COVID-19, you must isolate. For more information see [COVID-19 travel requirements from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/travel-to-kenya/covid-19/covid-19-travel-requirements).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Kenya, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You must [apply online for electronic travel authorisation](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en) in advance of travel. The local authorities recommend applying at least 2 weeks before your departure.

Travellers who currently hold a visa can continue to travel using their visa until it expires.

For information on work permits and residency, check the [Kenyan Department of Immigration](https://immigration.go.ke/) requirements.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Kenya, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Kenya guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/117/kenya#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules
