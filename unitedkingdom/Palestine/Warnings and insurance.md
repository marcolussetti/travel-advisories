## Regional risks

There is a heightened risk of regional tension. Escalation could lead to travel disruption and other unanticipated impacts.

British nationals should take sensible precautions, considering their own individual circumstances. These include:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* Follow advice from the local authorities and sign up to receive information and alerts. Read [Israel’s Home Front Command](https://www.oref.org.il/eng)
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, [Israel’s Home Front Command provides guidance on how to find a protected space](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/emergencies/protection-guidelines). The best option is a residential protected space (Mamad, Mamak or Maman) or a communal shelter. If that is not possible, choose a stairwell without windows and exterior walls and stay at its centre

## If you are in Israel and Palestine

Due to ongoing regional tensions, we recommend against all but essential travel to Israel and Palestine. We continue to recommend against all travel to parts of Israel and Palestine.

We have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily move some of our staff and their dependents from Tel Aviv to another location within Israel. Our Embassy continues to operate as normal.

The situation could escalate quickly and poses significant risks. Regional tensions may cause international borders (air and land) to close.

If you are in Israel and Palestine, be aware that whilst the frequency of missile and drone attacks has decreased, there is still a risk of rocket and drone attacks throughout Israel. There is a risk of shrapnel from intercepted missiles falling across Israel and Palestine, and possible disruption at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.

Political tension can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events.

Keep up to date through local media and follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:

* visit the [Israeli Home Front Command website](http://www.oref.org.il/en) (available in Israel only)
* call 104 if you are in Israel

Before travelling within Israel or Palestine, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.

Travel within or out of Israel or Palestine is at your own risk. You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter.

## Leaving Gaza

Border crossings out of Gaza have been closed to civilians and general traffic since the Israeli military took control of the Rafah crossing on 6 May 2024. Consular support is not available from within Gaza. If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, you should make contact with us as soon as possible. There are currently no exit routes available for foreign nationals to depart Gaza independently. We are working with the Israeli, Palestinian and other authorities in the region to help British nationals leave via safe routes.

If you are a UK visa holder who meets all of the following criteria, you can contact us to request support to leave Gaza if:

* you have a spouse/partner or a child aged 17 or under currently living in the UK, and
* you hold valid permission to enter or remain in the UK for longer than 6 months

## Help from other organisations

Keep up to date with local travel advice through local news outlets and international outlets like the [Access Coordination Unit](http://www.accesscoordination.org/).
