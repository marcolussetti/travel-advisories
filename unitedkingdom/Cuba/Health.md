# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 104 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Cuba](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/60/cuba#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Cuba,](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/60/cuba) including:

* dengue
* Zika virus
* malaria
* Oropouche virus disease

To control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, the Cuban authorities may carry out chemical fumigation measures across the island. The chemicals used may cause some discomfort if you come into contact with them.

## Medication

There are severe shortages of basic medicines, but clinics treating foreigners are more likely to stock basic medical supplies. Many medicines, pharmacy items and sanitary products that are easily accessible in the UK, are not available in Cuba.

If you have a pre-existing medical condition, do not expect to buy medication in Cuba. A letter from your GP stating treatment and dosage may be helpful if you need treatment from a medical practitioner.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Cuba

Medical facilities in Havana are better than elsewhere in Cuba. If you need medical treatment, you or your insurance company will need to pay by card with foreign currency before any treatment. Make sure you have accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Cuba](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cuba-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Psychiatric care facilities for foreigners are limited and difficult to access.
