## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Cuba

## Power outages and fuel shortages

Cuba is experiencing severe and worsening disruption to essential infrastructure, persistent nationwide power outages and fuel shortages. These conditions significantly affect the ability of visitors to access reliable transport, medical care, communications, and basic services.  Authorities have introduced fuel rationing, scaled back public services, and made temporary changes to healthcare, education, transport and tourism operations in order to conserve severely limited energy supplies.  Flight schedules are also being disrupted due to aviation fuel shortages, with some airlines reviewing routes or temporarily cancelling services which risk visitors being unable to leave the country.

If you are currently in Cuba, carefully consider if your presence is essential. Take precautions by conserving fuel, water, food and mobile phone charge, and be prepared for significant disruption.  Check for messaging from your airline or tour operator.
