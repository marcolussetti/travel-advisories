## Power outages and fuel shortages

Cuba is experiencing serious issues with its national power grid and fuel supply. Prolonged power outages – over 24 hours in some instances – are a daily occurrence across the country, affecting water supply, lighting, refrigeration and communications.  There is also a shortage of fuel affecting transportation and resulting in long queues at petrol stations. The fuel shortage also impacts resorts and businesses which often rely on oil/diesel-powered generators. Take precautions by conserving fuel, water, food and mobile phone charge, and be prepared for significant disruption.

The Cuban government has imposed strict limitations on the purchase of fuel at petrol stations from 7 February 2026. This will impact travel within Cuba.

You will need to factor this into planning for any journey. Diesel fuel cannot be bought in Cuban Pesos or US Dollars. Petrol is currently limited to a maximum purchase of 20 litres.

We understand that some tourists are being relocated to different hotels to maximise fuel consumption from generators. You should contact your tour operator for further details.
