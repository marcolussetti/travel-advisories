## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Cuba

### Power outages and fuel shortages

Cuba is experiencing severe and worsening disruption to essential infrastructure, persistent power outages across the country and fuel shortages. These conditions are significantly affecting the ability of visitors to access reliable transport, medical care, communications, and basic services. Authorities have introduced fuel rationing, scaled back public services, and made temporary changes to healthcare, education, transport and tourism operations to conserve severely limited energy supplies.

Cuban authorities have announced that all of its international airports are without aviation fuel. Some airlines, including all Canadian airlines and LATAM, have suspended flights to and from Cuba, with others reviewing routes. This limits your options to leave the country.

The situation has the potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning. Make sure you are ready to change your plans quickly if needed. If you are considering leaving Cuba, check for messaging from your airline or tour operator for up to date information. Ensure your travel documents remain valid and confirm you have any required visas for onward travel.

If you are currently in Cuba, carefully consider if your presence is essential. Take precautions by conserving fuel, water, food and mobile phone charge, and be prepared for significant disruption.
