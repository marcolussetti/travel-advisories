## Mosquito-borne diseases

The Cuban government has declared an arbovirus epidemic following the increase in cases of Dengue, Oropouche and Chikungunya in Cuba. Take precautions to avoid or prevent mosquito and other insect bites. Please refer to the Health section for more information.

## Hurricane Melissa

As a result of Hurricane Melissa, infrastructure and services, including access to electricity and water, remain severely impacted in the East of Cuba.

Follow the guidance of local authorities. See ‘Extreme weather and natural disasters’ on the [‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cuba/safety-and-security).

## Power outages

Lengthy power outages are a daily occurrence across Cuba. Take precautions such as conserving fuel, water, food and mobile phone charge, particularly if travelling outside Havana. Transport may be affected due to fuel shortages and the inability to refuel during power outages. Ensure you have enough fuel before setting off on your journey.
