# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 or 919 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for The Bahamas](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/19/bahamas#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in The Bahamas](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/19/bahamas), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue

### HIV and AIDS

It’s estimated that at least 7,600 adults aged 15 or over in The Bahamas are living with HIV – around 3.2% of the adult population. This compares to around 0.3% in the UK. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in The Bahamas

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in The Bahamas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners-in-bahamas).

Medical treatment is of a good standard but can be expensive. Emergency medical facilities are limited on all the Family Islands. Serious cases are transferred to Nassau or Freeport – or Miami, USA – by air ambulance. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

## Travel and mental health
