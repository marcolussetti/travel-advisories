# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

## Passport validity requirements

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Permits

Anyone on a British expedition to Antarctica or taking a British vessel or aircraft into Antarctica must apply for a [permit from the Polar Regions Department of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)](https://www.gov.uk/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit).

For passengers on an organised visit to Antarctica, the tour operator usually arranges a permit. If you are concerned, talk to your operator.

If you travel to any part of Antarctica without permission, you could get a fine or a prison sentence.

## Vaccine requirements
