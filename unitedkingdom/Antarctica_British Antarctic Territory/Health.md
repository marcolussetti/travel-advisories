# Health

Before you travel check that:

* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) that specifies Antarctica
* you have accessible funds to cover unexpected medical evacuation. This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Antarctica](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/9/antarctica#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

There are very limited medical facilities within the Territory. Be aware of the harsh climatic conditions in Antarctica.

Most people visit the Antarctic by ship. Some areas of the Antarctic are uncharted and ice-covered. Search and rescue teams called to vessels in Antarctic waters may be far away and take several days to arrive, particularly in bad weather. They can only offer basic transport and medical care and are unlikely to be able to offer advanced life support.

Before you book:

* check the experience and credentials of operators
* review the on-board medical facilities and discuss any pre-existing conditions with your operator

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of the British Antarctic Territory. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).
