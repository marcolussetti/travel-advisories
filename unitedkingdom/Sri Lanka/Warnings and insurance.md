## Travel disruption caused by Cyclone Ditwah

Cyclone Ditwah hit Sri Lanka on 28 November, and has caused flooding and landslides throughout much of Sri Lanka, resulting in the loss of life. As a result, travel in many areas has been disrupted. Check before travelling, including with your airline and/or tour operator, to understand how this might affect your travels.

Sri Lanka Tourism has a 24-hour hotline available on 1912.
