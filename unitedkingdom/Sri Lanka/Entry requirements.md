# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Sri Lankan High Commission in the UK](https://srilankahc.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Sri Lanka, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

To enter Sri Lanka, you need to apply for an ‘Electronic Travel Authorization’ (ETA) which is a form of visa.

### Applying for an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA)

Apply for a [Sri Lanka ‘Electronic Travel Authorization’ (ETA)](https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/extsheta.jsp?locale=en_US) online. You should do this before travel. ETAs will be valid for 30 days. Alternatively, you can also apply for an on-arrival ETA at the airport’s Immigration counter.

If you plan to stay longer, you can apply for an extension online through Sri Lankas [official Immigration portal](https://eservices.immigration.gov.lk/vs/home.php). You do not need a visa if you are transiting through Sri Lanka by air, if the connecting flight is within 24 hours of your arrival. Check with your airlines about transit times.

For more information on Sri Lankan visas, please visit [Department of Immigration and Emigration](https://www.immigration.gov.lk/index_e.php).

### Overstaying your visa

If you overstay the period of your ETA (30 days), you risk being subject to immigration procedures that may include temporary detention, a fine, deportation at your own expense, a travel ban or refusal of entry to Sri Lanka in the future.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Sri Lanka, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Sri Lanka guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/204/sri-lanka#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Sri Lanka](https://www.customs.gov.lk/personal/travellers/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into Sri Lanka

Most major banks allow Visa and Mastercard cash withdrawals. There are ATMs in major towns and cities, but not all accept international cards.

You cannot transfer money without an exchange control permit issued by the [Central Bank of Sri Lanka](https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en).
