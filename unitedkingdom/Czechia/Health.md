# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Czechia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/62/czech-republic#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Czechia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/62/czech-republic#General_Information).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Czechia

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Czechia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/czech-republic-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards

To get medically necessary state healthcare in Czechia, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
* what treatment counts as medically necessary

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:

* changes to travel and accommodation bookings
* additional standard costs for treatment
* medical repatriation to the UK
* treatment that is ruled non-urgent
* private healthcare
* private clinics

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Czechia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-czech-republic#healthcare-in-the-czech-republic).
