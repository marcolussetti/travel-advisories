# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 1122 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest vaccinations and health risks in [TravelHealthPro’s Pakistan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/171/pakistan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

### Polio vaccination programme

Pakistan is rolling out a widespread polio vaccination programme in an effort to eradicate polio. You should provide proof of polio vaccination if asked by a vaccination team. Any exemption due to a medical condition needs to be supported by a medical certificate issued by recognised health authority.

### Altitude sickness

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Bottled water

Take care when buying bottled water and follow advice on [TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/44/food-and-water-hygiene).

### Air Pollution

Air pollution is a health hazard in Pakistan, especially during the winter months from October to February. Punjab is one of the worst affected regions, particularly Lahore.

Read about the [risks of poor outdoor air quality on TravelHealthPro](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/219/outdoor-air-quality).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Medical supplies may be difficult to find in Pakistan due to restrictions on imported goods.

## Healthcare in Pakistan

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Pakistan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pakistan-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

The standard of local medical facilities is lower than in the UK, especially in remote areas. Private medical care is expensive but available in all major cities. Specialised treatment for psychiatric illnesses may not be available outside major cities.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
