# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Pakistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Pakistan High Commission in London or nearest Pakistani consulate](https://www.phclondon.org/contactus).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Pakistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date of your visa application.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry.

Leaving Pakistan will be difficult if you do not have an entry stamp. If your passport was not stamped on entry, contact the [Ministry of Interior](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk) or visit a National Database and Registration Office (NDRA) office.

Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you enter without the correct documentation you may be detained or deported. If you enter Pakistan illegally, you may not be able to travel onward from Pakistan.

## Visa requirements

You need a visa to visit Pakistan and you must apply in advance.

### Applying for a visa

See [information on visa categories and how to apply](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/visa-categories/).

Visas for journalists often have extra travel restrictions. Follow the terms of your visa, or you could be fined or detained.

You can also [apply for visa extensions](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/visa-categories/).

### Returning to the UK

You must have an unexpired visa, a Pakistani national identity card or a Pakistani passport to leave Pakistan.

If your visa has expired, [apply online for an exit permit](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/exitpermit/) from within Pakistan before attempting to travel.

If you do not have evidence of Pakistani nationality and you entered without a visa, contact the [Ministry of Interior](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk) or visit a NADRA office.

## Citizens of Pakistan overseas

The National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) or Smart National Identity Card Overseas Pakistanis (SNICOP), are issued to citizens of Pakistan who are not resident in Pakistan. If you hold either, you will be recognised as a citizen of Pakistan. You can enter Pakistan without a visa and stay for an unlimited period. See [how to apply for Pakistani identity cards](https://www.phclondon.org/nadra).

## Travelling with children

If you’re travelling with a child as a single parent or are not the child’s parent, you may need to provide documentary evidence of parental responsibility before leaving Pakistan. This is particularly likely if the child is of Pakistani origin.

## Crossing land borders

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against travel to most of the Pakistan-Afghanistan, Pakistan-China and Pakistan-Iran border areas. FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan and Iran.

### Pakistan-Afghanistan border

All borders with Afghanistan can close at short notice. There has been overcrowding and violence at open border crossings.

If entering Pakistan via the Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan you will need a valid Pakistan visa.

### Pakistan-Iran border

All official land border crossings with Iran are located in Balochistan province, where the FCDO advises against all travel.

Border crossings may be closed at short notice, and access is limited and closely monitored. If entering Pakistan via a land border with Iran, you will need a valid Pakistan visa. Check with local authorities or travel providers for the latest information before attempting to cross.

### Pakistan-India  border

The international border between Pakistan and India is subject to strict controls. The Wagah border crossing on the Grand Trunk Road is the only official land  crossing between the two countries, but it is currently closed. The Kartarpur Corridor is currently not in use for Sikh pilgrims visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.

Ensure you have the necessary visas and documentation and check with local authorities or travel providers before attempting to cross.

### Pakistan-China border

The Khunjerab Pass, the only official land border crossing between Pakistan and China, is located on the Karakoram Highway and is open to foreign tourists. It is open seasonally, typically from April to November, but can close at very short notice due to severe weather conditions, particularly snowfall during colder  months. Check the weather conditions before you travel as conditions can change at short notice and landslides and snowfall can block the route.

Be aware that border closures may occur without warning on either side, and access to the area is remote and limited. Ensure you have the appropriate Pakistani visa and Chinese entry documentation before attempting to cross. Check with local authorities or your travel provider for the latest updates before travelling to the region.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Pakistan, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio vaccine, in some circumstances

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Pakistan guide](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/171/pakistan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Health screening

### Mpox

In response to the recent international mpox outbreaks, travellers may experience enhanced screening and preventive measures, including testing, on entry to Pakistan.

Read [more about mpox on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/125/mpox-monkeypox).

## Customs rules

### Alcohol and pork
