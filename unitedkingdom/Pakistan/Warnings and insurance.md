### Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.

## Support during a crisis

If a severe crisis develops in Pakistan, the situation can change quickly including your ability to travel. Regional tensions during May 2025 resulted in sustained airspace closures which caused airlines to suspend flights, domestic travel was also restricted. Practical support from the British government, including face-to-face consular support or evacuation, may be severely limited in a crisis. Read our [general guidance on consular support in a crisis.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas)

Be prepared to re-arrange your own departure from Pakistan at short notice. If it is not safe or possible to leave, you should:

* stay indoors whenever possible, and have a stock of essential supplies such as food, drinking water and medicine
* obey any local restrictions such as curfews
* monitor the media for developments that would allow you to leave safely
