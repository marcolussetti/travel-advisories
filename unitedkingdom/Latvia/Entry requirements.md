# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Latvia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Latvian Embassy in the UK](https://www2.mfa.gov.lv/en/london).

## British-Russian dual nationals

If you hold dual nationality with Russia, you could be refused entry to Latvia. See current [legal guidance for Russian citizens](https://likumi.lv/ta/id/358965-noteikumi-par-treso-valstu-valstspiederigo-vizu-pieteikumu-pienemsanas-un-iecelosanas-ierobezojumiem-latvijas-republika), which is now in force until 1 January 2027.

## Passport validity requirements

Latvia follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes Latvia, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in Latvia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-latvia-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At Latvian border control, you may need to:

* show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
* show proof of your travel insurance, including health cover and medical repatriation
* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must meet the Latvian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa you need with the [Latvian Embassy in the UK](https://www2.mfa.gov.lv/en/london).

If you’re in Latvia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

## New Schengen entry requirements

From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin. When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to:

* have you fingerprints and your photo taken
* answer the Schengen Border Code questions

If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or St Pancras International, this information will be taken at the border, before you leave the UK. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area.

EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border once the system starts.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Latvia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/125/latvia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Latvia](https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/customs). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking food and drink into Latvia

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Taking money into Latvia

Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.

### Restrictions on third-country vehicles

Any vehicle registered in third countries, including the UK, must be declared for use in Latvia via the [e-services](https://e.csdd.lv/trvalstutldeklar/) of the Road Traffic Safety Directorate before entering Latvia. No fee will be charged for the service and it can be done without personal authentication, but the e-mail address used will have to be verified. See [Latvia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs webpage](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/article/road-traffic-safety-directorate-informs-vehicles-registered-third-country-will-have-be-declared-use-road-traffic-latvia-1-january-2025) for more information about the declaration process.

Vehicles with Russian and Belarusian plates and registration are, with a few technical exceptions, banned from entering Latvia and using Latvia’s roads. See [Latvia’s State Revenue Service](https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/article/persons-vehicles-registered-russian-federation-are-banned-entering-latvia?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mfa.gov.lv%2F) and [Latvia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/article/eu-sanctions-against-belarus-significantly-limit-opportunities-circumventing-sanctions-against-russia) for more information.
