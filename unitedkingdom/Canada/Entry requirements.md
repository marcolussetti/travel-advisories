# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Canada’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Canada set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Canadian High Commission in the UK](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/london-londres.aspx?lang=eng).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Canada, your passport must be valid for the length of your planned stay.

If you’re travelling through another country on your way to or from Canada, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only allow entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.

## Visa requirements

To enter or transit through Canada, most people need a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) – not both.

[Check if you need a visa or an eTA online](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp).

You do not need a visa for short visits (normally up to 6 months). You may need an eTA instead.

You do not need an eTA, if you are:

* arriving by land and sea – you must have [acceptable travel documents and ID](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html)
* a British-Canadian dual national – you must have a valid Canadian passport

See [Canada’s entry requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html) for full details of eTA and visa requirements.

Contact the [Canadian High Commission in the UK](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/london-londres.aspx?lang=eng) if you are unsure about visa requirements or your eligibility to enter the country, for example, if you have a criminal record or have been arrested.

### Checks at border control

Canadian border officials may ask you to show a return or onward ticket and proof that you have sufficient funds to support yourself for the duration of your stay, even if you are staying with family or friends.

### Visas for permanent residence, study or work

See information on [visas for permanent residence, study or work in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html).

### Transiting through Canada

If you are travelling through Canada (transiting) by air, you must have an eTA or a transit visa.

If you have questions, contact:

* your airline
* [Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html)
* your nearest Canadian high commission, embassy or consulate

### Visa and eTA scams

Some unauthorised websites charge for submitting visa applications. These websites are not associated with the Canadian government.

You can [check your eTA status online with the Canadian government](https://onlineservices-servicesenligne.cic.gc.ca/eta/applicationQuery?lang=en). If it has been 72 hours since you applied, and you have not received confirmation of your application, [complete an enquiry form](https://secure.cic.gc.ca/enquiries-renseignements/canada-case-cas-eng.aspx).

## Travelling with children

If a child travels alone or with only one parent or legal guardian, they should carry a letter of consent from the non-travelling parents or guardians. Immigration officers have the right to question children using simple and appropriate language to see if there are any concerns about child abduction.

For more information, check with the [Canadian High Commission in the UK](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/london-londres.aspx?lang=eng) or the [Canada Border Services Agency](http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html#_s3).

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Canada guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/41/canada#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/what-you-can-bring-home-to-canada). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

The Canadian authorities will confiscate banned food products and you could get a fine. For more information, see [importing food, plants or animals to Canada](https://inspection.canada.ca/importing-food-plants-or-animals/eng/1573836795867/1573836899201).

If you visit a farm or have contact with wild animals before entering Canada, and plan to visit a farm during your stay, you must declare this on your Customs Declaration Card. For more information, see [biosecurity at the Canadian border](https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/biosecurity/general-public/border/eng/1344754371697/1344754930771).
