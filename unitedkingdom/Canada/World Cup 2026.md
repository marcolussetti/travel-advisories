# World Cup 2026

The FIFA World Cup takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US from 11 June to 19 July 2026. If you are travelling to attend:

* sign up to get [email updates](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/email-signup) on travel advice for Canada
* download the official FIFA World Cup 26 app (on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fifa-world-cup-26/id6476561442) and on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fifa.tournament&hl=en)), and check the official World Cup 2026 website to stay informed of anything that might affect your travel or plans whilst in Canada
* entry requirements, and local laws and customs, will likely be different for each of the countries co-hosting the tournament. If you are planning to visit or transit through more than one country, check the [Travel Advice page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) for each country

In Canada, matches will be hosted in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia. Expect other cities and popular tourist destinations across Canada to be busier than usual during the tournament.

## Visa and entry requirements

Check the [entry requirements](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/entry-requirements) for Canada, especially information on passport validity, visa requirements and applying for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

See the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/soccer-2026/information-fans-travellers.html) website for the latest information.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.

## Match tickets and stadium entry

Only purchase tickets through the official FIFA ticketing platform; no tickets will be sold at stadiums. To enter the stadium, you will need an official ticket on the FIFA World Cup app. Printed copies or screenshots may not be accepted at stadium gates. Each ticket is linked to the purchaser’s details, and ID checks may be required upon entry.

Tickets sold on unofficial resale websites, social media, or through third-party vendors may not be genuine. Fraudulent tickets can look legitimate but may be rejected at the stadium gate, leaving you without entry on match day. Some scammers sell the same ticket to multiple buyers or resell tickets that have already been voided by FIFA Ticketing. Even if a ticket scans at the gate, you may be denied entry if it is flagged as invalid or already used. Unofficial sources often inflate prices significantly, especially for high demand matches like play-offs or rivalry matchups, without any guarantee of authenticity.

Ensure you check the stadium’s code of conduct for any match you are attending. This sets out what you can bring into the World Cup stadiums.

Check the official [FIFA World Cup 2026 ticketing page](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/tickets) for more information.

## Accommodation

There will be a very high demand for accommodation. Plan ahead to ensure you have accommodation during your stay.

## Transport to and from the events

Transport routes around the stadiums will be very busy during the tournament. Local authorities may ask you to enter or leave the stadium by specific routes. Make sure you:

* plan your journey
* leave plenty of time, particularly on match days

If you’re planning to hire a car or use taxis in Canada, check the ‘Transport Risks’ section on the [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/safety-and-security) page for more information
