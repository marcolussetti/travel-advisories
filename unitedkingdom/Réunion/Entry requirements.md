# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Réunion’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

Réunion is an Overseas Department of France (‘Département d’Outre-Mer’).  The French authorities set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Consulate General in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave Réunion.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

Réunion is an Overseas Department of France and so is part of the EU.

You can visit Réunion without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism or business. To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, check the [visa application process and timelines](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/royaume-uni) on the French visa website.

### UK residents of Réunion

Carry your residence document, as well as your passport, when entering or exiting Réunion. If you’ve applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email.
