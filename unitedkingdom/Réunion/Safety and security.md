# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Réunion

Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Réunion, attacks cannot be ruled out.

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

### Swimming safety

See [water safety on holiday](https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday) from the Royal Life Saving Society.

There have been shark attacks in Réunion. Follow advice from local authorities or your tour operator about which beaches are safe.

### Scuba diving

Diving schools may have limited resources and do not always observe safety and maintenance standards. Always:

* ask to see a dive operator’s credentials
* check the conditions on your insurance policy – some policies require dive instructors to have certain qualifications
* make sure safety equipment looks to be in good condition
* make sure oxygen is available on the boat
* ask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber

If you have not had any previous diving experience, check what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea.

## Transport risks

The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.

Check with the local authorities or your car hire company if you need an [international driving permit (IDP)](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit) as well as your UK driving licence.
