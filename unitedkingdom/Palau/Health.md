# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Palau](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/172/palau#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Palau](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/172/palau), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue

## Medication

The Belau National Hospital in Koror has a pharmacy that dispenses basic medicines.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Palau

Health facilities in Palau are adequate for routine medical care. The only national hospital is Belau National Hospital in Koror, which is less than 2 hours from most locations. The hospital has a hyperbaric chamber to treat patients in diving accidents and can carry out operations.

There are small number of private clinics and community health centres that offer basic primary and urgent care services. Doctors and medical centres often expect immediate cash payment.

Emergency treatment or treatment for serious conditions is limited so may require medical evacuation. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
