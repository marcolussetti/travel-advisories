# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 119 and ask for an ambulance.

Unlike in the UK, an ambulance crew will not usually include a paramedic.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Taiwan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/218/taiwan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Taiwan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/218/taiwan).

There has been a significant increase in cases of [dengue fever](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/13/dengue) in the south of Taiwan (including the cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan). Take [precautions to avoid mosquito bites](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/insect-tick-bite-avoidance/). See [key updates from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Taiwan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

If you’re bringing any prescribed medicine into Taiwan, bring the prescription issued by your doctor, hospital or clinic that shows the medicine is for your personal use. The amount of medication you bring must be consistent with the amount stated on the prescription. You cannot bring cannabis oil or cannabis-derived medication into Taiwan, even if it’s legally prescribed elsewhere.

For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, contact the [Taipei Representative Office in London](http://www.roc-taiwan.org/uk/).

## Healthcare in Taiwan

Taiwan’s health and dental facilities offer a range of routine, emergency and outpatient services. Some have English-speaking staff. Hospitals operate on a ’pay as you use’ basis. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment in Taiwan including possible repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Taiwan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/taiwan-list-of-medical-practitioners-hospitals) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Taiwan](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-taiwan).

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
