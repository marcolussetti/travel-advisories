### Land borders/ crossing with Thailand and Cambodia

There were reports of fighting including rocket and artillery fire on 24 July between Thailand and Cambodia, at several locations including along the border arears with Laos. Casualties have been reported, as well as evacuations of areas close to the border. Land borders/crossings between Thailand and Cambodia have been suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are currently closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

British nationals in Southern Laos travelling to Cambodia or Thailand , should carefully consider which land border crossings to use. British Nationals should also carefully consider any travel they have planned close to the Lao border adjoining the affected areas.
