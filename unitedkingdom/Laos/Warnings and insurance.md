## Monsoon/rainy season

The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to October, at the same time as the typhoon season in south-east Asia. Follow and monitor local and international weather updates. The [Mekong River Commission](https://www.mrcmekong.org/) posts official updates on the Mekong River.

Follow the advice of local authorities. Travel to some provinces can be seriously disrupted during this time. Monitor local news and check World Meteorological Organization weather reports. 2025 has seen higher than expected rainfall in Laos and 19 deaths due to flooding so far.

## Land borders and crossing with Thailand and Cambodia

In July 2025, Thailand and Cambodia fought along parts of the border. The fighting included the use of rocket and artillery fire. Tensions remain with reports of the latest round of gunfire on 23 September. Land borders and crossings between Thailand and Cambodia continue to be  suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

British nationals in Southern Laos travelling to Cambodia or Thailand , should carefully consider which land border crossings to use. British Nationals should also carefully consider any travel they have planned close to the Lao border adjoining the affected areas.
