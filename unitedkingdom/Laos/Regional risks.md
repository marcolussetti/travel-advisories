# Regional risks

## Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Laos. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/laos) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/laos/safety-and-security).

## Xaisomboun Province

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Xaisomboun Province. There were reports in 2021 of attacks on infrastructure and armed clashes with anti-government groups in the province. There could be more skirmishes.

## Borders with Thailand and Myanmar (Golden Triangle)

There have been small-scale clashes between anti-government groups and government troops in isolated areas along the Laos-Thailand border. The local law enforcement agencies have limited capability to counter these threats.

Be extremely cautious in Bokeo Province, particularly near the borders with Myanmar and Thailand, and around the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. Armed groups carry out employment scams and drug trafficking in this area.
