# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Laos’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Laos set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, send a message to the [Lao Embassy London Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LaoEmbassyLondon/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Laos, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages.

Airlines will only let you board your flight if your passport has enough blank pages.

Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Laos.

To work, study and travel for business or other reasons, you must meet the [Lao immigration department’s entry requirements](https://immigration.gov.la/require-for-working-investing-and-studying-in-lao/).

### Applying for a visa

From 1 January 2025, tourist visas reverted to the previous 30 days from the date you arrive in Laos.

You can [apply online for a Laos e-visa](https://laoevisa.gov.la/index) – apply at least 5 days in advance. The e-visa is single entry only and is accepted at major entry points.

You can also get a visa on arrival (single entry) at many entry points, including:

* Vientiane Wattay airport
* Luang Prabang airport
* Paske airport

See a full [list of the entry points that accept e-visas and visas on arrival](https://immigration.gov.la/en/checkpoints/category/category/?limit=12&offset=0&category=international-border-checkpoint).

### Visa extensions

From 1 January 2025, you’re allowed to [extend your tourist visa](https://immigration.gov.la/how-to-apply-visa-extension/) twice while in Laos, for a total of 60 additional days.

If you do not extend your visa within 90 days, you will face a fine in Lao kip worth 2,000 US dollars, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Laos.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Laos guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/124/laos#Vaccine_Recommendations).
