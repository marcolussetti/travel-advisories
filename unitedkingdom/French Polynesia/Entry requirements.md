# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of French Polynesia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

French Polynesia is an Overseas Collectivity of France (‘Collectivité d’Outre-Mer’). The authorities in French Polynesia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Consulate General in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave French Polynesia.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit French Polynesia without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism or business. To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, check the [visa application process and timelines](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/royaume-uni) on the French visa website.

If you want to work in French Polynesia, get permission from the [French Consulate General](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-) before you travel there.

### UK residents of French Polynesia

Carry your residence document, as well as your passport, when entering or exiting French Polynesia. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email.

## Vaccine requirements

You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s French Polynesia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/83/french-polynesia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of French Polynesia](https://www.douane.gouv.fr/particuliers/vous-etes-en-outre-mer/territoires-et-collectivites-doutre-mer/polynesie-francaise) (in French). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into French Polynesia

Check [what cash and valuables you need to declare](https://www.douane.gouv.fr/fiche/obligation-declare-cash-securities-and-valuables) to bring them into French Polynesia.
