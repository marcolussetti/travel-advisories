# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 15 (or 4048 5906 from a landline) and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for French Polynesia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/83/french-polynesia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in French Polynesia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/83/french-polynesia), including:

* chikungunya
* dengue

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in French Polynesia

General healthcare facilities in French Polynesia are good for uncomplicated treatment, but more serious cases may need evacuation to a larger healthcare facility. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

### Healthcare for residents

If you plan to live in French Polynesia, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about long-term entitlement to healthcare under the French national system.

DWP Overseas Medical Benefits helpline: +44 (0)191 218 1999

You can also get English-language [information about French social security services online](https://www.cleiss.fr/index_en.html) or on +33 (0)820 90 42 12. You can get French-language information online about [state services in French Polynesia](https://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/).

### Health insurance cards

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) do not provide health cover for you if you go to French Polynesia to visit or to live.
