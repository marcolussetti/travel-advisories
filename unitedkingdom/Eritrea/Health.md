# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 122244 and ask for an ambulance. Please note that the call handler may not speak English.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccinations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* the latest information on [vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Eritrea guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/74/eritrea)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Eritrea. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

There is a limited range of medicines available in Eritrea, and many of those are produced locally. If you’re taking prescription medication, make sure you have a supply for your stay plus a contingency.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

## Healthcare facilities in Eritrea

There are 3 public hospitals in Asmara. Public hospitals in other towns are often poorly equipped. In rural areas medical facilities are even more limited. If you’re travelling away from the large towns, carry a comprehensive medical pack with you.

FCDO has a list of [medical facilities in Eritrea](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/doctors-and-medical-facilities-worldwide-list) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
