# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Eritrea

Ambulance: 122244

Fire: 116

Police: 113

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.

* how to access previous versions of travel advice to support a claim

## Consular assistance

Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. Constraints on travel within Eritrea mean the British Embassy is often unable to deliver in-person consular assistance outside the greater Asmara area.

The Eritrean authorities may not inform the British Embassy if a British national is in need of help. There have been instances where the Eritrean authorities have refused to give the Embassy consular access to detained foreign nationals.
