## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice.

### Within 25km of Eritrea’s land borders

FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of all Eritrea’s land borders. The land borders with Djibouti and Ethiopia are closed. Eritrea’s land border with Sudan is operational in response to the conflict in Sudan and people are crossing the border in both directions.

## Support for British nationals in Eritrea

Consular support is severely limited in parts of Eritrea. If you’re in Eritrea and you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked or arrested, or someone has died), call the British Embassy in Asmara on +291 1 202 838. If you’re in the UK and worried about a British national in Eritrea, call 020 7008 5000.

### British-Eritrean dual nationals

If you are a British-Eritrean dual national, the Eritrean authorities consider you to be an Eritrean national. This applies if you hold identity documents issued by Eritrea’s Department of Immigration and Nationality, including out of date documents. The British Embassy is unable to offer consular assistance to dual nationals in Eritrea. Embassy staff will be unable to gain consular access to you if you are detained by the Eritrean authorities.
