# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 or 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Tuvalu](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/230/tuvalu#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Tuvalu](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/230/tuvalu#General_Information), including dengue.

### Drinking water

Drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

## Healthcare facilities in Tuvalu

Tuvalu’s only hospital is on Funafuti. Trained nurses serve the outer islands. Medical facilities are generally adequate for routine medical treatment. For more serious or complicated problems, you may need medical evacuation to Fiji or Australia.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance, sufficient medication supplies and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
