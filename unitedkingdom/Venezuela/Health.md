# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Nationwide ambulance services like [AeroAm](http://www.aeroambulanciassilva.com.ve/) (in Spanish) can help you get back to Caracas or other major cities if you’re in an accident.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Venezuela](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/239/venezuela#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Venezuela](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/239/venezuela), including:

* yellow fever
* dengue
* schistosomiasis (a parasitic infection).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Venezuela, mainly in the Andean region of the country: Mérida, Táchira and Trujillo states. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation has reported a shortage of 80% of medical supplies due to the economic crisis. Make sure you bring enough medication for your stay, including extra medication in case your return is delayed.

## Healthcare facilities in Venezuela

Medical facilities in Venezuela vary widely in quality. In large cities, private clinics provide acceptable care for routine treatments but are vulnerable to acute shortages of medical supplies and medicines. More complex treatments may require evacuation. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

Public health facilities are poor, with frequent shortages of medicines and funding. Ambulance services in remote areas are unreliable and hospitals often lack adequate medical supplies and equipment.

FCDO has a list of [English-speaking doctors in Venezuela](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/venezuela-list-of-medical-facilities-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.
