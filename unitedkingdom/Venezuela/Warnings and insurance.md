Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Within 80km of the Venezuela-Colombia border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 80km (50 miles) of the border with Colombia. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Colombia and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping.

### Zulia State

FCDO advises against all travel to Zulia State, which has prolonged power cuts, water shortages, violence and local conflict.

### Within 40km of the Venezuela-Brazil border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 40km (25 miles) of the border with Brazil. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Brazil and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping.

### All other areas of Venezuela

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela, due to ongoing crime and instability.

## Flights

Some airlines have cancelled flights at short notice.  If you have an upcoming flight to or from Venezuela you should stay in touch with your airline or travel agency.

## State of External Commotion

Plans for a ‘state of external commotion’ were announced on 29 September 2025. If decreed by the authorities in Venezuela  – in the event of a case of internal or external conflict – this could lead to the closure of Venezuelan borders and airspace.

The situation in Venezuela is currently tense. Consular access and support to British nationals in Venezuela may be severely limited.  If you choose to travel to Venezuela, monitor developments closely through local and international media and keep up to date with this travel advice.
