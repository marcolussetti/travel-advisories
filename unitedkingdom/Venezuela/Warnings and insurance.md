Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Within 80km of the Venezuela-Colombia border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 80km (50 miles) of the border with Colombia. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Colombia and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping.

### Zulia State

FCDO advises against all travel to Zulia State, which has prolonged power cuts, water shortages, violence and local conflict.

### Within 40km of the Venezuela-Brazil border

FCDO advises against all travel to within 40km (25 miles) of the border with Brazil. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Brazil and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping.

### All other areas of Venezuela

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela, due to ongoing crime and instability.
