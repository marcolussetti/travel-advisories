Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## The FCDO advises against all travel to Venezuela

FCDO advises against all travel to Venezuela. If you are a British National already living or travelling in Venezuela, you should shelter in place, but be prepared to change your plans quickly if necessary. Regularly review your departure options and make sure your travel documents are valid and accessible. You should have a ‘personal emergency plan’, including practical steps for leaving the country or staying safe during a crisis, that does not depend on support from the UK government.

## State of External Commotion

On 3 January, Venezuelan authorities announced a ‘state of external commotion’ due to air strikes on targets across the country. This could lead to closure of Venezuelan borders and airspace.
