# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Solomon Islands’ current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the Solomon Islands set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Solomon Islands Embassy in Belgium](https://solomonislandsembassy.com/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter the Solomon Islands, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages for entry stamps.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit the Solomon Islands without a pre-arranged visa for up to 30 days. You will be given a visa when you arrive. Contact the [Solomon Islands Immigration Department](http://www.commerce.gov.sb/) for information.
