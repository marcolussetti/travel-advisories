# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 15 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Senegal](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/192/senegal#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Senegal](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/192/senegal) including:

* dengue
* Zika virus
* yellow fever
* Rift Valley fever

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You’ll find pharmacies which accept UK prescriptions in major cities. The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

## Healthcare in Senegal

Medical facilities in Dakar are reasonable, but are limited in the rest of Senegal. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Senegal](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-recommemded-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
