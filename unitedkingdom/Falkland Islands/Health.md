# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Outside of Stanley, coverage is limited and there may be delays in emergency assistance arriving.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the Falkland Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/77/falkland-islands#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the Falkland Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/77/falkland-islands), including insect and tick bites.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in the Falkland Islands

The Falkland Islands has a modern [hospital in Stanley](https://www.falklands.gov.fk/health/kemh) with medical and dental staff. There is no resident qualified optician. You may need to be medically evacuated to Chile or Uruguay for more complex treatments.

You can access free medical care in the Falkland Islands through the UK-Falkland Islands reciprocal healthcare agreement, which covers:

* hospital treatment
* other medical treatment
* prescribed medicines
* ambulance travel

You will need proof of UK residency, such as an NHS medical card or passport. You must take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance which includes at least 2 million US dollars for medical evacuation as this is not covered under the UK-Falklands reciprocal healthcare agreement. Other medical costs are also not covered. Find out more about [healthcare for UK citizens in the Falkland Islands](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-reciprocal-healthcare-agreements-with-non-eu-countries#falkland-islands).

There is also guidance on [healthcare if you’re living in the Falkland Islands](https://www.falklands.gov.fk/health/).
