# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

The Falkland Islands is a British Overseas Territory, so there is no British Embassy, and the [Falkland Islands government](https://falklands.gov.fk/government-services) will support you if you need help.

## Emergency services in the Falkland Islands

Telephone: 999 (ambulance, fire, police)

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
