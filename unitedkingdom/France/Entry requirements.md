# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in France set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Embassy in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/Contact-Us-24150).

## Passport validity requirements

France follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave the Schengen area

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes France, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in France](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-france-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

If you cannot return to the UK before your visa-free limit expires, contact the nearest [local prefecture in France](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Le-ministere/Prefectures).

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At French border control, you may need to:

* show proof of your accommodation
* show proof of your travel insurance
* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have [enough money for your stay](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/your-arrival-in-france)

### Staying with family, friends or a third party

You may be asked to provide a welcome invitation (‘attestation d’accueil’) from your host. The French resident hosting you must get the [attestation d’accueil](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2191?lang=en) from their local mayor’s office and send the original attestation before you enter France.

### Second homes in France

You may need to show evidence of ownership or tenancy of your property, such as a tax or utility bill.

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer than 90 days, you must meet the [French government’s entry requirements](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N105?lang=en).

If you’re in France with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

## New Schengen entry requirements

The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.

### Taking food and drink into France

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Taking money into France

Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
