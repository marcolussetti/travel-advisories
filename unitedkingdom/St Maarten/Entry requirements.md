# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of St Maarten’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

St Maarten is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It sets and enforces its own entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Netherlands Embassy in the UK](https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/web/united-kingdom/about-us/contact-embassy-london).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter St Maarten, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can stay in St Maarten for up to 90 days without a visa. See [St Maarten visa information](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/caribbean-visa).

## Vaccine requirements
