# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Make sure your policy covers the following:

* existing health conditions
* an air ambulance, in case you need to be flown home by this means
* full medical cover (medical bills can be expensive)
* repatriation of your remains in the event of death
* repatriation of your family in the event it is necessary for you to return home due to illness or injury

The British Embassy do not pay medical bills and cannot provide medical assistance.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 115 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* the latest vaccine recommendations for Vietnam in [TravelHealthPro’s Vietnam guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/240/vietnam#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Vietnam](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/240/vietnam), including:

* mosquito-borne diseases like Zika virus, dengue, malaria and Japanese encephalitis
* air pollution – see [information on air quality on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/219/outdoor-air-quality)

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Vietnam. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

Some medicines can be hard to find in Vietnam and many are fake.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Vietnam has restrictions on medicines it classifies as ‘addictive’ or ‘psychotropic’. These include medicine used to treat of addiction, anxiety, depression, insomnia and other conditions.

It is illegal to have more than 7 days of prescribed medicine by a doctor (addictive and psychotropic medicine). You should carry the prescription with your medication and a letter from your doctor stating how much of the medication you need during your trip.

The letter can be in English and should:

* include your name and age
* list the medicine name, volume and dosage
* include the doctor’s signature and address

If you’re unsure if your medication falls within these categories or you need to bring more medication than is usually allowed, contact the [Vietnamese Embassy](https://vietnamembassy.org.uk/) in the UK before travelling.

## Healthcare in Vietnam

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Vietnam](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-vietnam) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Vietnam](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-vietnam).

## Travel and mental health

Vietnam has no Mental Health Act and as such support is very limited for foreign nationals.

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
