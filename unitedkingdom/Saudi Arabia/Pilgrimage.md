# Pilgrimage

Many British nationals travel to Saudi Arabia each year for Umrah or Hajj pilgrimage.

## Entry requirements for pilgrimage

You should also read the main section on [Entry requirements](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/entry-requirements).

You can apply for an e-visa or electronic visa waiver to perform Umrah outside of the Hajj season.

You can only book a Hajj place through the official [Nusuk Hajj platform](https://hajj.nusuk.sa/).

Please note the Saudi authorities have implemented entry restrictions from 13 April for those entering Mecca. For more information see [The Holy Mosques on X](https://x.com/theholymosques/status/1911116879923466352?s=48&t=tYzvavh8NfQMOAkzjLNsyA).

### Health risks and vaccine requirements

You must have a valid certificate of vaccination against the ACWY strains of meningitis 10 days before arriving for Hajj and Umrah. For more information on health risks and vaccination requirements, read the [TravelHealthPro Hajj and Umrah guide](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/hajj-and-umrah).

Check [Health](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/health) for advice on bringing medicines into Saudi Arabia. Make sure you have enough medication for your entire trip, including if your return is delayed.

Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. Flu, colds and respiratory problems are common.

Prepare for extreme heat. During the summer months, the temperature may exceed 50°C. Consume enough liquids and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.

## Scams

UK-based organised crime groups target people planning Hajj or Umrah trips. Criminals pick people of any age, gender or location for their scams. Many victims are over the age of 65.

To avoid scams:

* be aware you can only book a Hajj place on the [Nusuk Hajj platform](https://hajj.nusuk.sa/)
* check [Saudi Ministry of Hajj](http://www.hajinformation.com/) information for the procedures you must follow
* make sure your travel agent or operator is [ATOL](http://www.caa.co.uk/atol-protection/) protected when booking Umrah
* research the travel company before you book, even if family or friends recommended it
* be wary of offers too good to be true – criminals advertise fraudulent deals through licensed travel companies

### Paying for trips

When paying for your Hajj or Umrah visit:

* use a credit card where possible
* have an audit trail and keep a record of any transactions
* get everything confirmed in writing
* always ask for written terms and conditions

### Reporting fraud

If you have been a victim of Hajj fraud in the UK, contact:

* your local police
* [City of London Police Fraud Desk](https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/ro/report/fo/v1/fraud/)
* [Action Fraud](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/)
