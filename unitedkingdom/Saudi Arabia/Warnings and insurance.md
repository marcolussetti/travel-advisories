## Stay at Home

Due to reports of missile activity in the region, we advise all British nationals to stay at home.

Remain indoors in a secure location and follow instruction from the local authorities.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Regional risks

There is a heightened risk of regional tension. Escalation could lead to travel disruption and other unanticipated impacts.

British nationals should take sensible precautions, considering their own individual circumstances. These include:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* follow advice from the local authorities and sign up to receive information and alerts
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, stay indoors or find the nearest safe building or designated shelter. An interior stairwell or a room with as few external walls or windows as possible may provide additional protection

## Before you travel

No travel can be guaranteed safe. Read all the advice in this guide and see [support for British nationals abroad](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad) for information about specific travel topics.

### Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
