# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Saudi Arabia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Saudi Arabia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Saudi Embassy in the UK](https://embassies.mofa.gov.sa/sites/uk/EN/Pages/default.aspx).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Saudi Arabia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Previous travel to Israel

You may not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia if your passport shows that you have travelled to, or were born in, Israel.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must get an e-visa or an electronic visa waiver, either before you travel or on arrival at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports. The [type of e-visa or electronic visa waiver](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/travel-regulations) you choose depends on your reason for travelling and how long you want to stay.

If you overstay your visa, you could face large fines, detention and deportation. You could be banned from returning to Saudi Arabia.

### Applying for an e-visa

You can apply for an e-visa if you are a tourist. You must get an e-visa to perform Umrah.

E-visas are:

* valid for 365 days from the date of issue
* valid for multiple entries, but only for 90 days in total across the 365 day period

[Apply for an e-visa online](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/) or when you arrive at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports.

An e-visa includes health insurance for your visit – for more information contact the Ministry of Tourism.

You must get a separate visa for Hajj. See [Pilgrimage](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/pilgrimage).

### Applying for an electronic visa waiver

Electronic visa waivers are for:

* tourism
* business
* medical treatment
* study
* Umrah (outside of Hajj Season)

An electronic visa waiver allows you to enter Saudi Arabia once and stay for up to 6 months.

An electronic visa waiver does not include health insurance for your visit.

[Apply for an electronic visa waiver online](https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/) at least 48 hours before your flight, or up to 90 days in advance. You will need to give your flight details.

### Travelling overland

Your visa may only allow you to enter Saudi Arabia by air. If you plan to travel to Saudi Arabia by the Bahrain causeway, check your visa before travelling. Ask your travel agent or the Saudi Embassy if you need help.

Check with your airline or travel agency if you require a transit visa.

## Exit, re-entry and final exit permits

If you live in Saudi Arabia, you must get an exit or re-entry permit from your sponsor to leave and re-enter the country. If you leave Saudi Arabia on a final exit permit, you must apply for a new visa to return to the country.

### Wives and children of Saudi nationals

If you’re a woman married to a Saudi national, you must get a re-entry or final exit permit from your husband to leave Saudi Arabia. This also applies to children of Saudi nationals.

## Flight restrictions around Hajj

If you plan to travel around the time of the Hajj pilgrimage, check with your airline for any flight restrictions.

The Saudi authorities have stopped visitors who are not performing Hajj from flying to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. You may need a Hajj visa to board flights to these places during Hajj.

You will still be able to enter Saudi Arabia through other airports.
