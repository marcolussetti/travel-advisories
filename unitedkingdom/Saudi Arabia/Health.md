# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Saudi Arabia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/191/saudi-arabia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Saudi Arabia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/191/saudi-arabia).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Saudi Arabia. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. There is an increased risk of heat stroke and dehydration during the summer months. Bring basic medicines with you and consume adequate liquids and salts.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. In Saudi Arabia some prescribed or over-the-counter medicines are controlled substances. You may need approval from the Saudi authorities to bring some prescription drugs. See [rules on bringing prescription drugs to Saudi Arabia](https://saudiembassy.net/bringing-prescription-drugs-kingdom-saudi-arabia).

If you need to bring controlled or prescription medication, make sure you have an official prescription, hospital note or a letter from your GP, which includes:

* the amount prescribed
* details of the drug and dosage
* your doctor’s signature
* a stamp from the clinic or hospital

See [narcotics and psychotropic substances information from the Saudi government](https://www.sfda.gov.sa/).

UK prescriptions are not accepted in Saudi Arabia. Only doctors registered and licensed by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialities may issue prescriptions.

Pharmacies are common and easy to find, particularly in the big cities. All hospitals have a dispensing pharmacy. Shopping malls and plazas sell international brands.

## Healthcare in Saudi Arabia

Healthcare facilities in major Saudi cities are of a high standard. Most towns have a health centre or basic hospital. Serious cases may be transferred by ambulance or air to a hospital in a major city, which might be some distance away.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Saudi Arabia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/saudi-arabia-list-of-medical-facilities-and-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.
