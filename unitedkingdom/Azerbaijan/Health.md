# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Azerbaijan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/17/azerbaijan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Go to TravelHealthPro to see [what health risks you’ll face in Azerbaijan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/17/azerbaijan).

Altitude sickness is a risk in some parts of Azerbaijan, including the ski resorts of Shahdag and Tufangdag in the Gusar district, Lake Batabat in Nakhchivan, and the Talysh mountains.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare facilities in Azerbaijan

Medical facilities outside Baku are very limited. Carry a comprehensive first aid kit for any trips out of Baku. Even in Baku, serious illness or injury may require evacuation to Turkey or Western Europe. Make sure you have appropriate travel health insurance.
