Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:

* Nagorno-Karabakh
* the districts (‘rayons’) of Zengilan, Jabrayil, Qubadli, Lachin and Kelbajar on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border
* western areas of the rayons of Khojavand, Fuzuli and Aghdam

### Azerbaijan-Armenia border

The border with Armenia remains closed. The FCDO advises against all travel to within 5km of the border with Armenia, due to tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Note that this does not include the border of Azerbaijan’s Nakhchivan exclave with Armenia.

## UK government support

Help for British nationals is extremely limited in Nagorno-Karabakh. The British Embassy is not able to give support in person in these areas.
