Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Azerbaijan-Armenia border

The border with Armenia remains closed. The FCDO advises against all travel to within 5km of the border with Armenia, due to tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Note that this does not include the border of Azerbaijan’s Nakhchivan exclave with Armenia.

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### South-western Azerbaijan (those regions affected by conflict in 2020 and 2023)

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:

* The districts (‘rayons’) of Kelbajar, Lachin, Qubadli, Zengilan, Jabrayil, Fuzuli, Khojavand, Shusha, Khojali, Khankendi, Aghdam and Tartar

You should follow Azerbaijani national government and local authorities’ advice in areas that have not been cleared of mines or unexploded ordnance.
