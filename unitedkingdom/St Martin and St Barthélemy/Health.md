# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 15 or 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for French overseas territories in the Carribean](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/262/caribbean-islands-france#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in St Martin and St Barthélemy](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/262/caribbean-islands-france), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in St Martin and St Barthélemy

Healthcare facilities, including emergency services, hospitals and the availability of doctors (GPs), are good and of an equivalent standard to those found in mainland France. Some specialist treatment may only be available on the larger French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

### Healthcare for residents

If you’re planning a permanent move to St Martin or St Barthélemy, consult the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for advice on long-term entitlement to healthcare under the French national system. You should phone the DWP Overseas Medical Benefits helpline on +44 (0)191 218 1999.

Alternatively, you can get information from the English-language service of the Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (the French social security service) on +33 (0)820 90 42 12 or [CLEISS](https://www.cleiss.fr/index_en.html).

## Health insurance cards

### St Martin

St Martin is an outermost region of the EU. Apply for a free [UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) or [European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC, it will still be valid if it remains in date.

The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state-provided medical treatment necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as St Martin nationals. If you do not have your card with you or you’ve lost it, [contact the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-overseas-healthcare-services).

It’s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. A GHIC or EHIC does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. Read more about [what your travel insurance should cover](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance).

GHIC and EHIC cover state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or private clinic.

For more information read guidance on [healthcare when travelling in Europe](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare).

### St Barthélemy

St Barthélemy is not part of the EU, for the purposes of the EU regulations governing access to healthcare. You cannot get any form of free healthcare there. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
