# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Vanuatu’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Vanuatu set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Vanuatu Department of Immigration and Passport Services](https://immigration.gov.vu/index.php).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Vanuatu, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

Check with the [Vanuatu Department of Immigration and Passport Services](https://immigration.gov.vu/) for details of whether you need a visa in advance of travel.
