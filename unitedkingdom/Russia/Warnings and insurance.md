Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Russia

FCDO advises against all travel to Russia due to the risks and threats from its continuing invasion of Ukraine, including:

* security incidents, such as drone attacks, and Russian air defence activity
* lack of flights to return to the UK
* limited ability for the UK government to provide support

There is also a high likelihood terrorists  will try to carry out attacks, including in major cities. See [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/russia/safety-and-security).

## Limited UK government support

The British Embassy in Moscow and British Consulate in Ekaterinburg are open, but the situation could change at short notice.

In-person UK government support in Russia is limited. It is very limited in parts of Russia because of the security situation and the size of the country, particularly in the North Caucasus.

If you need support, call our 24-hour helpline +7 495 956 7200 and select the option for consular services for British nationals.

Contact the Russian emergency services on 112.

### Dual nationals

If you hold both British and Russian nationality, Russian authorities will treat you as a Russian citizen. This limits the consular assistance the UK government can provide. If you are arrested or detained, Russian authorities are unlikely to allow UK consular staff to visit or assist you.

### Military Service

Russia operates a conscription-based military system. Men aged 18 to 30 with Russian citizenship may be called up for two-year compulsory military service. Conscription campaigns take place twice a year.

Russian law prevents eligible individuals from leaving Russia once their draft notice appears on the federal electronic draft register.

If you receive a conscription notice via your account on the Russian State Services portal, you will be prohibited from leaving Russia. Failure to report to the conscription point within seven days of receiving the notice may result in penalties, restrictions on your rights, or detention.

In addition to regular conscription, Russia has declared a partial mobilisation. Military recruitment is ongoing, and anyone with Russian citizenship may be drafted.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
