Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

## Thailand-Malaysia border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:

* Pattani Province
* Yala Province
* Narathiwat Province
* The districts of Chana, Thepa, Na Thawi and Saba Yoi in southern Songkhla Province

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.

This is due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia. See [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/safety-and-security) .

## Thailand-Cambodia border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the land border with Cambodia.

## General election and alcohol restrictions

Thailand will hold a General Election on 8 February 2026. A nationwide ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol will be in place from 6pm on 7 February until 6pm on 8 February.

During this period:

* public consumption of alcohol is prohibited, including at social gatherings
* the restrictions apply to convenience stores, bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues, both public and private

If you do not comply with these restrictions, you could face fines of up to 10,000 baht and up to 6 months’ imprisonment.

## Thailand-Cambodia border

In July 2025, Thailand and Cambodia fought along parts of the border. The fighting included the use of rocket and artillery fire. Tensions remain and fighting erupted again at various points along the border in early December. Land borders and crossings between Thailand and Cambodia continue to be suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

We advise against all travel to the affected land border areas.

## Do not carry cannabis out of Thailand

British nationals have been caught carrying cannabis out of Thailand. There have been arrests of British nationals caught transiting through airports in other countries. Many international airports have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items, which may be used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
