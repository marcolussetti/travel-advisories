Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:

* Pattani Province
* Yala Province
* Narathiwat Province
* southern Songkhla Province – south of the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and south of the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Padang Besar

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.

This is due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia. See [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/safety-and-security) .

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to within 50km of the whole border with Cambodia.

## Thailand-Cambodia border

In July 2025, Thailand and Cambodia fought along parts of the border. The fighting included the use of rocket and artillery fire. Tensions remain with reports of the latest round of gunfire on 23 September. Land borders and crossings between Thailand and Cambodia continue to be suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

We advise against all but essential travel to the affected border areas.

## Do not carry cannabis out of Thailand

British nationals have been caught carrying cannabis out of Thailand. There have been arrests of British nationals caught transiting through airports in other countries. Many international airports have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items, which may be used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
