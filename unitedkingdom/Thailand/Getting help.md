# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Thailand

Telephone: 191 (ambulance, fire, police)

Ambulance: 1669

Fire: 199

Police: 191

Tourist police: 1155

The Tourist Police have developed a new application called Thailand Tourist Police to facilitate communication between tourists and our services online. The application is available to tourists who do not have a Thai SIM card. The application features information about tourist attractions and notifications regarding natural disasters or safety concerns in the vicinity of tourists.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
