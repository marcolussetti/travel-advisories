# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Thailand. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/thailand) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/safety-and-security).

## Thailand-Malaysia border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:

* Pattani Province
* Yala Province
* Narathiwat Province
* The districts of Chana, Thepa, Na Thawi and Saba Yoi in southern Songkhla Province

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.

This is due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia. See [Safety and security](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/safety-and-security) .

## Thailand-Cambodia border

In July 2025, Thailand and Cambodia fought along parts of the border. The fighting included the use of rocket and artillery fire. Tensions remain and fighting erupted again at various points along the border in early December. Land borders and crossings between Thailand and Cambodia continue to be suspended. Some tourist destinations in border areas such as the Khao Phra Wihan/Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai/Ta Krabey temple and the Ta Muen Thom/Tamone Thom temple are closed.

There are also unexploded landmines in the border area.

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the land border with Cambodia.

## Thailand-Laos border

Not all land border crossings into Laos are open to foreign nationals. Even if the border crossing is open, you may need to get a visa for Laos in advance. Check the entry requirements in the [Laos travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/laos/entry-requirements). Follow the instructions of local authorities and be vigilant in the border areas.

## Thailand-Myanmar border

The security situation in Myanmar is unpredictable and liable to change without notice. See [Myanmar travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar).
