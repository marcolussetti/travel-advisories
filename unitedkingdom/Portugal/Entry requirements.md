# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Portugal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Portuguese Embassy in the UK](https://londres.embaixadaportugal.mne.gov.pt/en/the-embassy/contacts/embassy).

## Passport validity requirements

Portugal follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has either been reported lost or stolen or is damaged.

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes Portugal, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The requirements for [working in Portugal](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-portugal-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

Until the Entry-Exit System (EES) is fully rolled out, make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit (read ‘New Schengen entry requirements’).

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At Portuguese border control you may need to show:

* an onward or return ticket
* proof you have enough money for your visit

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must [meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/viver) (in Portuguese).

If you’re in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

Read about [entry processes if you live in Portugal](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-portugal#passports-and-travel).

## New Schengen entry requirements

From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin roll out.

This means that when you travel into the Schengen area for short stays, you may need to register your biometric details, such as fingerprints and a photo. You do not need to take any action before you arrive at the border, and there is no cost for EES registration.

On your first visit into a Schengen country from 12 October onwards, you may be asked to register your details at a special booth before proceeding to the immigration desk. Follow directions from your travel operator or the staff at your port of entry. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area. Children aged 11 or younger will not have their fingerprints scanned but may need their photo taken.

EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border.

EES will not be rolled out to all ports of entry at once, the numbers of passengers being registered at each port of entry will vary, and some destinations may take up to 6 months to fully roll out the new process.

Until EES is fully rolled out your passport will continue to be stamped, even if you’ve already been registered for EES. Once EES is fully rolled out, it will replace the current system of manually stamping passports when visitors arrive in the Schengen area for short stays and you will input biometric details every time you enter or exit.

If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or Eurostar at St Pancras International and you are asked to register for EES, the information will be taken at the border before you leave the UK.

## Travelling with children

### Non-resident children travelling to Portugal

Children aged 17 and under travelling to Portugal alone, or with a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, must either:

* be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian
* carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The parent/guardian’s signature must be certified by a [solicitor](https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/) or [notary](https://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/notaries/find-a-notary/).

Make sure the letter includes:

* the child’s dates of arrival and departure
* the address where they will be staying
* the name of the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay
* the full names, dates of birth, passport numbers and contact details of the parent or guardian
* parent or guardian’s signature and date of issue

If you bring a child to Portugal without a properly certified letter of authorisation, your entry will be delayed and may be refused.

Teenagers aged 17 and under who travel alone, or with friends of the same age, and who are not being met, may be refused entry if they do not have a letter of authorisation.

### Non-resident children leaving Portugal

Non-resident children aged 17 and under who leave Portugal alone, or with a person who is not their parent or guardian, must have a properly certified letter of authorisation unless they are returning to their country of origin.

### Resident children leaving Portugal

A child aged 17 or under who is resident in Portugal must carry a properly certified letter of authorisation if travelling without their parent or legal guardian. See more details in the [Living in Portugal guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-portugal#passports-and-travel).

### Taking food into Portugal

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
