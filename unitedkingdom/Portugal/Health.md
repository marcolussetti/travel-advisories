# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

If you’re feeling unwell, but it’s not an emergency, call:

* Mainland Portugal: (+351) 808 24 24 24, press 9 for English. If you have hearing loss and cannot hear on the phone, you can make contact by [videocall or webchat](https://www.sns24.gov.pt/contacto-acessivel-cidadao-surdo/) (Portuguese language website).
* Madeira and Porto Santo: (+351) 800 24 24 20
* Azores: (+351) 808 24 60 24

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine information for Portugal](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/181/portugal#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Portugal](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/181/portugal#General_Information).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

UK prescriptions are not recognised in Portugal. Carry enough medication for your visit.

If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E. You may have to pay for your medication.

You will need to go to a pharmacy to get most medicines, though some non-prescription medication is sold at health stores in supermarkets and shopping centres. Find a pharmacy on the [Pharmacy Association website](https://www.farmaciasportuguesas.pt/catalogo/pesquisar-farmacias).

## Healthcare in Portugal

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Portugal,](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/portugal-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards

To get medically necessary state healthcare in Portugal, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
* what treatment counts as medically necessary

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:

* changes to travel and accommodation bookings
* additional standard costs for treatment
* medical repatriation to the UK
* treatment that is ruled non-urgent
* private healthcare
* private clinics
