## Wildfires

Chile is experiencing severe wildfires in the southern regions.

The Chilean Government declared a State of Catastrophe in Ñuble and Biobío regions. Chilean authorities are advising people to avoid the affected areas, follow official channels for up-to-date information and, in the case of an evacuation order, follow the evacuation process swiftly and calmly.

Curfews have also been in place in parts of these regions in recent days.

If you are in the affected areas, or in an area at risk of wildfires, keep up to date with and follow the advice of local authorities and emergency services. Have an evacuation plan ready that does not depend on the UK Government.

For further guidance on wildfires, including the times and locations of any further curfews, visit the website of [Chile’s National Disaster Prevention and Response Service](https://web.senapred.cl/) (Servicio Nacional de Prevención y Respuesta ante Desastres (SERNAPRED) (in Spanish).
