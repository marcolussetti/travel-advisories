# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 131 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [recommended vaccinations for Chile](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/48/chile#Vaccine_Recommendations) or [Easter Island](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/69/chile-easter-island#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Chile](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/48/chile), including altitude sickness, which is a risk in parts of Chile. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

There are confirmed cases of dengue fever on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Take steps to [avoid being bitten by mosquitoes](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Chile

There are good health facilities in Santiago and other major cities, but private clinics and hospitals are expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There is only one hospital on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and its facilities are limited. People suffering from serious illnesses or injuries are taken by air ambulance to mainland Chile for treatment. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Chile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chile-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners-2) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-chile-guidance) if you’re living in Chile.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
