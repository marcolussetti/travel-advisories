# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Chile’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Chilean Embassy in the UK](https://www.chile.gob.cl/reino-unido/en).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ after the day you plan to leave Chile.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Chile for up to 90 days without a visa.

The Chilean immigration authorities will give you a tourist card (‘tarjeta de turismo’), an A5-sized white form. Keep it safe and give it to immigration when you leave the country. If you lose it, Chilean police investigations (PDI) allows you to [request a copy online](https://pdivirtual.cerofilas.gob.cl/etapas/ver/31401667/0) (choose ‘Duplicado de tarjeta de turismo’). You can also go to the nearest PDI office.

To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must [meet the Chilean Government’s entry requirements](https://serviciomigraciones.cl/en/home/).

## Travelling with children

Chile requires children travelling with only one parent, with a guardian or alone, to have permission from the non-travelling parent or parents. Parents travelling with children for tourism have faced difficulty leaving Chile at the end of their visit when only one parent is present. You must have

* a written notarised authorisation from the non-travelling parent(s)
* a birth certificate

If you’re travelling with children aged 17 and under, check the website of the [Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.chile.gob.cl/en/chile/xplica/ingreso-y-salida-de-menores-del-pais) (website in Spanish) for what documents you need to show.

## British-Chilean dual nationality

British-Chilean dual nationals must enter and leave Chile using their Chilean passport. Chilean entry and exit requirements for dual nationals may change without notice. For further information check with the [Chilean Embassy in the UK](https://www.chile.gob.cl/en/reino-unido/en).

### Travelling with dual national children

Before a dual national child aged 17 or under leaves Chile, you must get authorisation to travel from a Chilean notary  (‘notaría’) if the child is travelling:

* alone
* with only one parent or guardian
* with friends or relatives

If a child was born in Chile, they must have a Chilean passport to leave the country.

## Travelling to Rapa Nui (Easter Island)

To [enter Rapa Nui (Easter Island)](https://www.gob.cl/rapanuiprotegida/en/requirements/) you must:

* complete a [Rapa Nui entry form](https://ingresorapanui.interior.gob.cl/)
* show a return ticket
