# Health

This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs).

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

For an ambulance dial:

* 100 in Israel
* 101 in the West Bank and Gaza

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Israel](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/110/israel#Vaccine_Recommendations) and [the OPTs](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/173/palestinian-territories#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Israel](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/110/israel#General_Information) and [the OPTs](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/173/palestinian-territories).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Israel and the OPTs

Healthcare in Israel and the OPTs is not free and medical treatment can be expensive. Hospitals will insist on payment and may take legal action to stop you leaving until bills are paid. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

FCDO has lists of [medical providers in Israel](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/israel-list-of-medical-facilities) and [medical providers in the OPTs](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-occupied-palestinian-territories-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Israel and the OPTs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/information-for-british-nationals-residing-in-israel-and-the-opts#healthcare-in-israel-and-the-opts).
