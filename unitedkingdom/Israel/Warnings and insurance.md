## Risks of regional escalation

Following Israeli strikes against targets in Iran, Iran launched multiple rounds of missile and drone attacks against Israel. On 23 June Iran launched military strikes against a US military base in Qatar. Iran aligned militia groups are also likely to continue to conduct attacks. A ceasefire began between Israel and Iran on 24 June. This is a fragile situation with the potential to deteriorate further, quickly and without warning.

Israel has lifted the nationwide state of emergency and reopened its airspace. Ben-Gurion Airport and Haifa Airport are restarting operations. The current situation has disrupted air links out of the country and may disrupt road links and border crossings. It may take time for airports to return to normal levels of operation and flight availability. We encourage you to read the FCDO’s advice on [if you’re affected by a crisis abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas).

Family members of staff at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv and the British Consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn as a precautionary measure.

The Embassy and Consulate continues with essential work including services to British nationals.

Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreign nationals such as:

* The Old City in Jerusalem
* Government, military and police installations
* Security personnel including military and police
* Transport networks
* Businesses with western interests
* Crowded places

### Check local information

You should check [Home Front Command](https://www.oref.org.il/en) for the latest guidance (available in Israel only) and follow instructions from the Israeli government. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice.

If you are in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and do not have access to Home Front Command continue to follow local instructions including from Palestinian Civil Defence (Call 102, or see [www.pcd.ps](https://pcd.ps/) or [الدفاع المدني الفلسطيني Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pcd.ps102?mibextid=LQQJ4d)).

Recent hostilities led to falling fragments or debris. If you encounter any projectile debris or fragments you should move away from them immediately and contact local authorities.

International land border crossings to Jordan and Egypt are open. Timings may change, or they may close, at no notice, including over the weekend. More information is available on the [Israel Airport Authority website](https://www.iaa.gov.il/en/land-border-crossings/alenbi/notifications-and-updates/). Before you travel check the travel advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through. Commercial transport services to border crossings (eg taxis and bus transport) are operating, subject to safety alerts. Commercial flights continue to operate from airports in the region to various destinations, including the UK.

Jordan-Israel border crossings (opening times are subject to change):

* Allenby/King Hussein Bridge
* The Northern (Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein) crossing
* The Southern (Yitzhak Rabin/Wadi Araba) crossing

Egypt-Israel border crossing (opening times are subject to change):

* Taba: Open 24 hours

## Leaving Israel/OPTs at Taba

At the border crossing from Israel to Egypt at Taba, you must pay a ‘Sinai Tax’ of 720 Egyptian Pounds per person (not applicable to children 24 months old or younger). This is payable at the Taba Border Crossing in Egyptian Pounds (cash only). There is a bank and ATMs dispensing Egyptian Pounds available at the border and in hotels on the Egyptian side. The ‘Sinai Tax’ exempts you from requiring an entry visa for Egypt for up to 15 days, as long as you stay within the Sinai Peninsula. If your stay in Sinai will exceed 15 days, or you are planning to leave the Sinai Peninsula, including to fly on from mainland airports e.g. Cairo or Hurghada, you will need an entry visa. This costs USD25 and can be purchased at the Taba Border Crossing on entry, or from the immigration office in Sharm El Sheikh.

## If you are in Israel and the OPTs

If you are in Israel and the OPTs, be aware that whilst the frequency of missile and drone attacks has decreased, there is still a risk of rocket attacks throughout Israel. There is a risk of shrapnel from intercepted missiles falling across Israel and the OPTs, and possible disruption at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.

Regional tensions can change quickly, which can cause international borders (air and land) to close. Political tension can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events.

Keep up to date through local media and follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:

* visit the [Israeli Home Front Command website](http://www.oref.org.il/en) (available in Israel only)
* call 104 if you are in Israel

Before travelling within Israel or the OPTs, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.

Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.

Travel within or out of Israel or the OPTs is at your own risk. You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter.

## Leaving Gaza

Border crossings out of Gaza have been closed to civilians and general traffic since the Israeli military took control of the Rafah crossing on 6 May 2024. Consular support is not available from within Gaza. If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, you should make contact with us as soon as possible. There are currently no exit routes available for foreign nationals to depart Gaza independently. We are working with the Israeli, Palestinian and other authorities in the region to help British nationals leave via safe routes.

If you are a UK visa holder who meets all of the following criteria, you can contact us to request support to leave Gaza if:

* you have a spouse/partner or a child aged 17 or under currently living in the UK, and
* you hold valid permission to enter or remain in the UK for longer than 6 months
