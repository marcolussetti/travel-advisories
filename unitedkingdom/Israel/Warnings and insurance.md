## If you are in Israel and Palestine

If you are in Israel and Palestine, be aware that whilst the frequency of missile and drone attacks has decreased, there is still a risk of rocket and drone attacks throughout Israel. There is a risk of shrapnel from intercepted missiles falling across Israel and Palestine, and possible disruption at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.

Regional tensions can change quickly, which can cause international borders (air and land) to close. Political tension can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events.

Keep up to date through local media and follow the instructions of Israeli Home Front Command. To find these:

* visit the [Israeli Home Front Command website](http://www.oref.org.il/en) (available in Israel only)
* call 104 if you are in Israel

Before travelling within Israel or Palestine, check the local measures in place, that roads are open and, where appropriate, that scheduled train and bus services are operating.

Travel within or out of Israel or Palestine is at your own risk. You are encouraged to follow the advice of local authorities, for example on which routes are open or when to take shelter.

## Leaving Gaza

Border crossings out of Gaza have been closed to civilians and general traffic since the Israeli military took control of the Rafah crossing on 6 May 2024. Consular support is not available from within Gaza. If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, you should make contact with us as soon as possible. There are currently no exit routes available for foreign nationals to depart Gaza independently. We are working with the Israeli, Palestinian and other authorities in the region to help British nationals leave via safe routes.

If you are a UK visa holder who meets all of the following criteria, you can contact us to request support to leave Gaza if:

* you have a spouse/partner or a child aged 17 or under currently living in the UK, and
* you hold valid permission to enter or remain in the UK for longer than 6 months

## Help from other organisations

Keep up to date with local travel advice through local news outlets and international outlets like the [Access Coordination Unit](http://www.accesscoordination.org/).
