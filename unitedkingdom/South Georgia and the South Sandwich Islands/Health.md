# Health

Before you travel make sure you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Make sure you have accessible funds to cover unexpected medical evacuation.

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Antarctica](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/9/antarctica#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

There are no search and rescue or other emergency services on the islands. The Falkland Islands and South America have the nearest medical facilities and are approximately 3 to 5 days sail away respectively. There’s no independent transport between South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the Falkland Islands or South America.

Before you book:

* check the experience and credentials of operators
* review the on-board medical facilities of the vessel and discuss any pre-existing medical condition with your operator

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).
