# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kyrgyzstan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kyrgyzstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Kyrgyz Embassy in the UK](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/vb).

## Passport validity requirements

If you’re visiting or resident in Kyrgyzstan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can enter Kyrgyzstan as a visitor for stays of up to 60 days without a visa. You must not stay more than 60 days in any 120-day period.

To stay longer, or to work or study, see more [information on the available visa](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/get_information.php?lng=en) types.

The Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has introduced an [e-visa service you can use for these visa types](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/).

### Registering with the authorities

If you’re visiting Kyrgyzstan for more than 60 days, you must [register online with the State Registration Service (SRS)](https://portal.srs.kg/ru/service/e2025f78-a118-40b3-a5f5-284494b185de) (in Kyrgyz and Russian). You must register within 5 days of your entry into Kyrgyzstan for the period of your visa’s validity.

If you’re staying with someone who owns a property in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 60 days, you and the property owner must register at the State Registration Service.

Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. If you overstay, you could get a fine and possibly be deported. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or visa if you want to stay in the country for longer than planned. If you’re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Kyrgyzstan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/123/kyrgyzstan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Kyrgyz-British dual nationality

Kyrgyzstan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport and are also a British national, the British Embassy will only be able to provide limited consular assistance. If you’re arrested or detained, the Kyrgyz authorities are unlikely to grant you access to British Embassy staff.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Kyrgyzstan](http://cbd.minjust.gov.kg/act/view/ru-ru/37817/10?cl=ru-ru) (in Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Medication

Bring a doctor’s prescription if you travel with prescription medicines and declare them on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Kyrgyzstan. Possession can lead to civil or criminal proceedings if you have not declared them on arrival. Some medicines which are available without a prescription in the UK might require a prescription in Kyrgyzstan.

If you are planning to take any medication with you, it is recommended that you contact the Kyrgyz Embassy into the UK or a local travel agency for further advice on whether any restrictions apply to the medications you are planning to bring.
