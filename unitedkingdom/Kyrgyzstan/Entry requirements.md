# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kyrgyzstan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Kyrgyzstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Kyrgyz Embassy in the UK](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/vb).

## Passport validity requirements

If you’re visiting or resident in Kyrgyzstan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can enter Kyrgyzstan as a visitor for stays of up to 60 days without a visa. You must not stay more than 60 days in any 120-day period.

To stay longer, or to work or study, see more [information on the available visa](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/get_information.php?lng=en) types.

### Applying for a visa

The Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has introduced an [e-visa service you can use for these visa types](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/).

### For visits of more than 60 days

If you’re visiting Kyrgyzstan for more than 60 days, you must [register online with the State Registration Service (SRS)](https://portal.srs.kg/ru/service/e2025f78-a118-40b3-a5f5-284494b185de) (in Kyrgyz and Russian). You must register within 5 days of your entry into Kyrgyzstan for the period of your visa’s validity.

If you’re staying with someone who owns a property in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 60 days, you and the property owner must register at the State Registration Service, see [information on registration in English](https://grs.gov.kg/ru/subord/drnags/information_for_foreigners/).

If you stay for more than your registered period, you could be fined.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Kyrgyzstan guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/123/kyrgyzstan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Kyrgyz-British dual nationality

Kyrgyzstan does not recognise dual nationality. If you enter Kyrgyzstan on a Kyrgyz passport, the British Embassy will only be able to provide limited consular assistance. If you’re arrested or detained, the Kyrgyz authorities are unlikely to allow you to get help from the British Embassy.

## Entering or leaving by a land border

Land border crossings can be subject to sudden closure, and foreigners may experience difficulty crossing, [check ahead to see if you are able to cross](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/get_information.php?lng=en) on the e-visa website under Important information.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Kyrgyzstan](http://cbd.minjust.gov.kg/act/view/ru-ru/37817/10?cl=ru-ru) (in Russian). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
