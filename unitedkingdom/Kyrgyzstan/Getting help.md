## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

## Risk information for British companies

If you’re considering investing or doing business in Kyrgyzstan, it is important to research carefully.

Although there are British companies operating successfully in Kyrgyzstan, there have been instances of British people getting into difficulties. This includes having assets stolen or being physically attacked. See Kyrgyzstan’s ranking in the [Transparency International Global Corruption Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022).

The Kyrgyz legal system can be slow and getting judgements implemented can be very difficult. The British Embassy is not able to get involved (including offering advice) in private disputes over property, employment, commercial or other matters.

Business associations in Kyrgyzstan may be able to offer you advice. If you get into difficulties due to the actions of state bodies, you can also contact the [Kyrgyzstan ombudsman](https://ombudsman.kg/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=114&filter_tag%5b0%5d=&Itemid=176&lang=en) (in Russian and Kyrgyz).
