# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Kyrgyzstan. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/kyrgyzstan/warnings-and-insurance) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/kyrgyzstan/safety-and-security).

## Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces

Stay aware of your surroundings if you travel to the provinces (‘oblasts’) of Osh and Jalal-Abad. While there has been no widespread violence since the ethnic clashes in 2010, there are still underlying tensions between the local Kyrgyz and Uzbek populations, particularly south and west of the city of Osh.

## Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Border

There is a history of border clashes in this area, and the security situation can change at short notice. There have been no further clashes since the border agreement in 2025. However, unexploded landmines and weapons continue to pose a serious risk. Border areas may be subject to sudden restrictions on movement and a heightened security presence. You should exercise caution if travelling near the Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan border, check local conditions before travel, and follow the advice of the local authorities.

## Border crossings

Crossing the borders  can be complex, take local advice if you’re planning on crossing.

Check local media reports before you travel to see which border posts are open. Only use officially recognised border crossings. Border crossings can close at short notice.
