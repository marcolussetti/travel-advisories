# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in New Zealand

Terrorist attacks in New Zealand cannot be ruled out.

## Crime

Crime levels are generally low, but street crime happens in major towns and cities. Thieves may target unattended vehicles, especially hire cars and camper vans in major tourist areas.

You should:

* avoid leaving possessions in unattended vehicles even if out of sight
* not leave valuables in hotel rooms
* use the hotel safe if possible
* keep passports, travellers cheques and credit cards separate

## Laws and cultural differences

### Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Importing illegal drugs could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years.

### LGBT+ travellers

New Zealand has an established tradition of tolerance towards same-sex relations, but there are still isolated incidents of homophobia-related crimes. LGBT+ travellers should be aware of local sensitivities, particularly when visiting rural areas. Read more [advice for LGBT+ travellers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice).

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

### Extreme sports

British nationals have been involved in tragic accidents while doing extreme sports activities. If you’re taking part in extreme sports, check that:

* the company is well established
* your insurance covers you

### Visiting remote areas

If you are planning to visit a remote area, check with the local tourist authorities for advice. To find out more information about being prepared, check:

* [New Zealand’s Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/know-before-you-go/)
* [AdventureSmart](https://www.adventuresmart.nz/) which is managed by the New Zealand Search and Rescue Council (NZSAR)

Leave details of your itinerary with family or friends. Weather conditions can quickly become dangerous in some coastal and exposed areas. Monitor regional weather forecasts.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in New Zealand, see information on [driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad) and read the [Road Code](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/). It lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.

You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in New Zealand for up to 18 months. You can [exchange an old-style paper licence](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence) if you need to.

Highways can be narrow, winding and hilly. Car rental companies should provide you with information, or read [what’s different about driving in New Zealand](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/safety/visiting-new-zealand/).

### Motor vehicle insurance

Hire car companies will arrange your insurance, but if you are driving a private vehicle you must get insurance, including accident cover. Accident victims do not have a legal right to sue a third party. The [Accident Compensation Commission (ACC)](https://www.live-work.immigration.govt.nz/resources/acc-helping-to-meet-the-costs-of-personal-injury#:~:text=The%20Accident%20Compensation%20Corporation%20%28ACC%29%20provides%20compulsory%20insurance,pay%20some%20of%20your%20medical%20and%20rehabilitation%20costs.) helps pay for local care if you’re injured.  However, delayed travel or loss of income in a third country is not covered.

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to [prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

Natural disasters can happen in New Zealand. If there is a disaster, follow the advice of the local authorities and the [National Emergency Management Agency](https://www.civildefence.govt.nz/). For more information, see the government’s [Get Ready](https://getready.govt.nz/) website.

### Earthquakes

New Zealand is in a major earthquake zone. Tsunamis can happen along the coastlines. You should:

* familiarise yourself with safety procedures. In New Zealand advice in the event of an earthquake is to ‘Drop, Cover, Hold’
* take note of instructions in hotel rooms and public areas
* find and check your local emergency services social media pages
* monitor any warnings or updates from the [National Emergency Management Agency](https://www.civildefence.govt.nz/)

For more information about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the New Zealand government’s [Get Ready advice for earthquakes](https://getready.govt.nz/emergency/earthquakes/).

If there is a tsunami warning, the Local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups will have tsunami evacuation zone maps and advice. Familiarise yourself with local arrangements from New Zealand’s [National Emergency Management Agency](https://www.civildefence.govt.nz/get-ready/get-tsunami-ready/tsunami-evacuation-zones).

### Flooding

Flooding and landslides can happen, resulting in road closures and infrastructure damage.

### Volcanic eruptions
