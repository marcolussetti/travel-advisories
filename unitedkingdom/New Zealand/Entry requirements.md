# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of New Zealand’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in New Zealand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [New Zealand High Commission in the UK](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/countries-and-regions/europe/united-kingdom/new-zealand-high-commission/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter New Zealand, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave.

If you’re travelling through another country on your way to or from New Zealand, check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries require at least 6 months validity on your passport. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit New Zealand without a visa for up to 6 months. However you do need a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA).

At New Zealand border control, you will also need to show:

* proof of a return or onward ticket
* proof that you have enough money for your stay

Check the full criteria for visa-free entry on [New Zealand Immigration](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/visa-waiver).

New Zealand has strict immigration rules, particularly on employment. You must have a visa to work or study in New Zealand.

Check the visa options and costs on [New Zealand Immigration](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas).

To extend your visa, first check your visa expiry date on the New Zealand [Visa Verification Service](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/our-online-systems/visa-verification-service). See [how to apply for a visa extension](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/already-have-a-visa/my-situation-has-changed).

### New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)

If you are entering without a visa, you need a [New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA)](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta) before you travel. You will also need to pay an [International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/your-journey-to-new-zealand/before-you-travel-to-new-zealand/paying-ivl) when you apply.

Allow up to 72 hours for it to be processed. Your NZeTA is valid for up to 2 years.

### Travelling through New Zealand

You will need to get a NZeTA before you travel if you are travelling through New Zealand to another country.

In most cases, transit passengers must hold an [NZeTA or transit NZeTA](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta) before travel.

## New Zealand Traveller Declaration

Everyone travelling into New Zealand needs to complete a New Zealand Traveller Declaration (NZTD). It is free and you can use the [online form](https://app.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/#/) or the [NZTD app](https://www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/nztd-app/). There is a paper declaration form for travellers who cannot complete it online.

Your declaration is linked to your passport and is checked when you arrive at the e-Gate or by a border officer.

### Travelling by air

The earliest you can submit your declaration is 24 hours before you start your trip to New Zealand. It needs to be submitted by the time you reach passport control in New Zealand.

If you are travelling on a domestic flight, familiarise yourself with security procedures, you can [read information on these from the New Zealand government](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/passenger-information/what-to-expect-at-the-airport/common-questions-from-passengers/#:~:text=Regional%20flights%20with%20planes%20that,AvSec%20(Aviation%20Security%20Service).).

### Travelling by sea

The earliest you can submit your declaration is 24 hours before departing the vessel’s last foreign port. It needs to be submitted by the time the vessel has arrived at its first port in New Zealand.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s New Zealand guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/162/new-zealand#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of New Zealand. It is illegal to import most food products. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

Some products, including wood and leather products, golf clubs, tents and fishing equipment, can carry harmful pests or diseases. Check [what items you are permitted to bring into New Zealand](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/bring-send-to-nz/bringing-and-posting-items-to-nz/check-if-you-can-bring-or-send-an-item-to-nz/). If in doubt, declare items to a Biosecurity New Zealand official or dispose of them in one of the marked bins available at the airport.

If you break any of these rules you could get a fine of up to 100,000 New Zealand dollars or a prison sentence.
