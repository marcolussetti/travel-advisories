# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 111 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for New Zealand](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/162/new-zealand#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in New Zealand](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/162/new-zealand)

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You must declare any prescription medicines on your passenger arrival card. All products containing codeine are classified as prescription-only medication (a controlled drug). You can import controlled drugs for personal use, but you must declare them on arrival to the Customs Service and provide evidence that they are for personal use.

See [New Zealand Customs](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/medicines-control/bringing-medicines-new-zealand) for more information on restrictions on medication.

## Healthcare in New Zealand

British nationals who live in the UK and who are on a short-term visit to New Zealand are eligible for urgent healthcare treatment. See the [reciprocal health agreement with New Zealand](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/our-health-system/eligibility-for-publicly-funded-health-services/reciprocal-health-agreements#summaries) for more details. This agreement does not extend to routine, non-emergency medical treatment including prescriptions.

You can call [Healthline for free medical advice](https://info.health.nz/services-support/healthline) (24 hours).
