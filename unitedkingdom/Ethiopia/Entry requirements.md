# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Ethiopia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Ethiopia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how Ethiopia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact the [Ethiopian Embassy in the UK](https://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must be:

* valid for at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Ethiopia
* machine-readable

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Ethiopia for tourism or business.

You do not need a visa if you have a valid Ethiopian Diplomatic ID Card, Ethiopian Temporary Residents Permit or Ethiopian Origin ID (Yellow Cards).

### Applying for a visa

We recommend UK nationals apply online for tourist and business visas before arrival.

You will need to provide a scanned colour copy of your passport and a colour passport sized photo. Get a 30-day single entry tourist visa from the official [Ethiopian e-visa platform](https://www.evisa.gov.et/).

If you visit Ethiopia on a tourist visa, you cannot take employment, including voluntary employment. If you break the rules, you can get heavy fines or be imprisoned.

[Check what type of visa you need](https://www.evisa.gov.et/) for business, work, study or other reasons.

You can apply for an official extension of 30 or 90 more days before your visa expires. You need to go in person to the Head Office of the Immigration and Citizenship Service in Addis Ababa.

Leave the country before your visa or your extension expires. The penalty for overstaying is 30 US dollars a day. You will not be allowed to leave until you pay in full.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Ethiopia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Ethiopia guide.](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/76/ethiopia#Vaccine_Recommendations)

You may need a yellow fever certificate for onward travel to some other countries, due to the risk of yellow fever in Ethiopia.

### Mpox screening

Travellers arriving from some countries are required to complete an [Ethiopian Ministry of Health survey](https://cbs.ephi.gov.et/redcap/surveys/?s=M9RPX4HR9748PDCR)
before arrival, if they are visiting Ethiopia or making a transit stop which includes movement outside of the airport. Check with your airline if the country you are traveling from requires this.

You could be required to undergo testing or treatment if you have symptoms.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods that you can take into or out of Ethiopia.

If you plan to take in specialist equipment, such as filming or audio equipment, the Ethiopian Embassy in London advises you check with your tour operator or local contact before you travel as special customs regulations may apply.

Contact the [Ethiopian Embassy Press Office for more information and advice](https://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/public-diplomacy/).

### Taking money into and out of Ethiopia

You can carry up to 3,000 Ethiopian birr when entering or leaving Ethiopia. An exception is when travelling to Djibouti from Ethiopia, in which case you can carry up to 10,000 birr. If you are found with more than the legal limits, customs authorities can seize your cash and you could get a prison sentence.

When you enter or leave Ethiopia, you must declare any cash over 10,000 US dollars (or equivalent in other currencies). Residents of Ethiopia, including resident British nationals, must declare any cash over 4,000 US dollars.

If you leave Ethiopia with cash above these amounts, you must show officials the customs declaration form you got when you entered Ethiopia, or the bank advice note if you purchased currency locally.

If entering Ethiopia through a land border you must declare cash worth over 500 US dollars.

Keep your receipt if you change currency into birr. Without a receipt you are unlikely to be able to change leftover money back at the end of your trip.

### Khat

Khat is legal in Ethiopia but it is illegal to take it out of the country. Customs officials regularly search luggage at Addis Ababa Bole Airport. Anyone found with khat is likely to be prosecuted.

### Antiques

You need an export certificate to take antiques out of the country. If you do not have one, border officials are likely to confiscate your items if they find them. You could be arrested and prosecuted by the authorities.

It is illegal to buy or possess ivory – even your own pieces brought in with you. British nationals have had ivory jewellery confiscated and the authorities have imposed fines of up to 25,000 birr (about £220).

### Satellite phones, binoculars and drones

It’s illegal to import or export satellite phones, binoculars or drones to or from Ethiopia without prior approval from the Customs and Information Network and Security Agency. Get advice from your travel provider on permissions required.

Unapproved items can be confiscated by authorities. You may be able to collect them on departure from Ethiopia, but this is not guaranteed.
