# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 907 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Ethiopia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/76/ethiopia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Ethiopia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/76/ethiopia), including:

* yellow fever
* malaria and dengue
* schistosomiasis
* Zika virus

Malaria is common in areas of the country up to 2,000 metres above sea level. Addis Ababa sits at 2,400m but a number of sites popular with tourists are below 2,000m.

Bilharzia is present in the vast majority of lakes in Ethiopia – check before swimming.

Water-borne diseases are common. Drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

There is an ongoing outbreak of cholera in the south of Ethiopia, and new cases have been reported in the north-west of the country.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa. [TravelHealthPro’s altitude sickness guidance](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness) has more information.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Ethiopia

Only private hospitals in Addis Ababa offer a reasonable standard of basic care for minor health problems. Dentistry is especially scarce. Ambulance services are also limited. Outside the capital, medical facilities are extremely poor. Carry a comprehensive medical pack when travelling out of Addis Ababa.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Ethiopia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ethiopia-doctors-and-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Ethiopia](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-ethiopia#healthcare-in-ethiopia).

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
