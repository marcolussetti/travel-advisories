## Earthquakes and volcanic activity

On 4 January the Ethiopian authorities began evacuating people from around Mount Dofan in Awash national park, due to increased volcanic activity. Earthquakes have affected the Afar and Amhara regions, and tremors have been felt in the surrounding area, including in Addis Ababa. Please see the [Safety and Security pages](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ethiopia/safety-and-security) - Extreme weather and natural disasters - Earthquakes for further advice.
