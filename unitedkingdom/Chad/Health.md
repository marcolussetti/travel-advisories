# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 1212 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Chad](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/47/chad#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Chad](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/47/chad).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Chad. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

### HIV and AIDS

According to UNAIDS, in 2018, the number of adults aged 15 or over in Chad living with HIV was estimated to be around 120,000; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 1.3% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.2%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Chad

Medical facilities in Chad are poor. Even in N’Djamena hospitals are stretched and sometimes affected by strikes. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Chad](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chad-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Chad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-chad).
