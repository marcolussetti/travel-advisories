## Limited UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Chad with assistance provided remotely from British High Commission Yaoundé. In-person assistance is not available.

If there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it could be difficult to leave safely.

Do not rely on the UK government to evacuate you as they may not be able to do so. Have your own plans on how you would leave the country, make sure you keep all travel documentation up to date and monitor the local situation.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
