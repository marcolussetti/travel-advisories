The FIFA World Cup takes place in Mexico, the US and Canada from 11 June to 19 July 2026. If you are travelling to attend:

* sign up to get [email updates](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/email-signup) on travel advice for Mexico
* download the official FIFA World Cup 26 app (on [iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fifa.tournament&hl=en) and on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fifa.tournament&hl=en)), and check the official [World Cup 2026 website](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/articles/fifa-world-cup-2026-hosts-cities-dates-usa-mexico-canada) to stay informed of anything that might affect your travel or plans whilst in the US
* entry requirements, and local laws and customs, will likely be different for each of the countries co-hosting the tournament. If you are planning to visit or transit through more than one country, check the [Travel advice page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) for each country

In Mexico, matches will be hosted in Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey. Expect other cities and popular tourist destinations across Mexico to be busier than usual during the tournament. Before travelling between cities, check the Travel Advice for your route, and be aware of restricted areas and surroundings.

## Visa and entry requirements

Check the [entry requirements](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/entry-requirements) for Mexico, especially information on passport validity and visa requirements.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.

## Match tickets and stadium entry

Only purchase tickets through the official FIFA ticketing platform; no tickets will be sold at stadiums. To enter the stadium, you will need an official ticket on the FIFA World Cup app. Printed copies or screenshots may not be accepted at stadium gates. Each ticket is linked to the purchaser’s details, and ID checks may be required upon entry.

Tickets sold on unofficial resale websites, social media, or through third-party vendors may not be genuine. Fraudulent tickets can look legitimate but may be rejected at the stadium gate, leaving you without entry on match day. Some scammers sell the same ticket to multiple buyers or resell tickets that have already been voided by FIFA Ticketing. Even if a ticket scans at the gate, you may be denied entry if it is flagged as invalid or already used. Unofficial sources often inflate prices significantly, especially for high-demand matches like play-offs or rivalry matchups without any guarantee of authenticity.

Ensure you check the stadium’s code of conduct for any match you are attending. This sets out what you can bring into the World Cup stadiums.

Check the official [FIFA World Cup 2026 ticketing page](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/tickets) for more information.

## Accommodation

There will be a very high demand for accommodation. Plan ahead to ensure you have accommodation during your stay.

## Transport to and from the events

Transport routes around the stadiums will be very busy during the tournament. Local authorities may ask you to enter or leave the stadium by specific routes. Make sure you:

* plan your journey
* leave plenty of time, particularly on match days
