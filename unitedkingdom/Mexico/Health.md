# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.

In Mexico City, you can use emergency buttons on CCTV cameras across the city to immediately connect to the emergency services.

Outside of state capitals and larger urban areas, medical and emergency services may be limited. This includes immediate response, ambulances, basic medical equipment and expertise.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mexico](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/147/mexico#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Mexico](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/147/mexico#General_Information), including:

* Zika virus
* chikungunya
* dengue
* air pollution

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Mexico. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Only drink boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

### Cyclospora

There have been [reported cases of Cyclospora](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/707/cyclospora-and-summer-travel), a food and water bug, affecting travellers returning from Mexico.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Many pharmacies in large cities in Mexico provide 24-hour service, including home deliveries of medication. You must get prescriptions issued outside of Mexico translated into Spanish. Local pharmacies may still decide to reject a foreign prescription. Many pharmacies have a GP who can assess a patient and prescribe medication.

## Healthcare in Mexico

Not all hospitals will agree to deal directly with medical insurance companies. Be prepared to pay for treatment yourself up front and then get a refund.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Mexico](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-mexico/mexico-list-of-medical-facilities-2021) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
