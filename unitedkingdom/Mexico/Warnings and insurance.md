### TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE PACIFIC SOUTH WEST COAST

A tropical storm warning and watch is in place for parts of the southwestern coast of Mexico.  Tropical Storm Raymond is expected to move parallel to the coast through today and then approach southern Baja California Sur over the weekend.  Strong winds and heavy rainfall are expected in parts of southwestern to northwestern Mexico particularly along the coastal areas of Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa and the central to southern ports of Baja California Sur.  This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

You should closely monitor local and international weather updates, including from the [US National Hurricane Center](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhc.noaa.gov%2F&data=05%7C02%7CSarah.Ballett%40fcdo.gov.uk%7C6dd9f3888cca4a52eb0a08de081bca56%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C638957112630350180%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=avTVceovfe%2BgJgSJffeS%2FoDSRH2owD4U1DekJS0%2B9ss%3D&reserved=0).  Follow the advice of local authorities, including the [National Civil Protection Secretariat](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FCNPC_MX&data=05%7C02%7CSarah.Ballett%40fcdo.gov.uk%7C6dd9f3888cca4a52eb0a08de081bca56%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C638957112630364258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=CDElneuMam7%2F4vCol0dnILb3rCb6vdrPtl%2BNthzSNpQ%3D&reserved=0) (in Spanish).
