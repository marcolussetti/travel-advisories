# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Most people in Belarus only speak Russian or Belarusian, so emergency services staff may not speak English. You may need to find someone who speaks English to interpret for you.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Belarus](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/24/belarus#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Belarus](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/24/belarus), including biting insects and ticks.

Do not drink village well water. It is usually heavily contaminated with impurities. In cities, boil then filter tap water before drinking. Bottled water is widely available.

## Medication

The availability of local medical supplies cannot be guaranteed – bring all essential medication with you.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

TravelHealthPro explains [best practice when travelling with medicines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

For more information on the legal status of a specific medicine, contact the [Embassy of Belarus in the UK](https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/embassy/address/).

## Healthcare in Belarus

The standard of healthcare is below that of the UK.

FCDO has a list of [medical facilities in Belarus](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belarus-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
