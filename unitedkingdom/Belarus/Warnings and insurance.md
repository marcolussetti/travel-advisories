Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus

FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus. You face a significant risk of arrest if you have at any time engaged in any activity now considered illegal by the Belarusian regime.

There is also a low risk that direct conflict linked to the war in Ukraine may spread to Belarus. Find out [more about why FCDO advises against all travel](/foreign-travel-advice/belarus/safety-and-security#risk-of-arrest-and-detention).

## Limited UK government support

In the unlikely event that conflict starts, FCDO’s ability to support British nationals will be severely limited.

### Dual nationals

Belarus does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both Belarusian and British passports, the authorities will consider you Belarusian, even if you enter the country on your British passport. This limits the UK government’s ability to help you. See [Safety and security](/foreign-travel-advice/belarus/safety-and-security#dual-nationals).

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and potential expenses in an emergency.
