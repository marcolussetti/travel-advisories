# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/101/honduras) for Honduras
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what health risks you’ll face in Honduras including:

* Zika virus
* malaria and dengue
* yellow fever

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Honduras. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Tap water is not generally safe to drink, but bottled water is cheap and widely available.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You cannot use British-issued prescriptions in Honduras. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’) look for one of the big national chains such as Farmacias Siman, Farmacias Kielsa or Farmacia El Ahorro.

## Healthcare in Honduras

State-funded hospitals are underfunded and medicines are in short supply. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Always carry evidence of your insurance. Use private clinics where possible, though these are only available in major towns.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Honduras](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-honduras) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Honduras](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-honduras).

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
