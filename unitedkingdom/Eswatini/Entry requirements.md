# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Eswatini’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Eswatini set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Eswatini High Commission in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Eswatini, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages for entry stamps.

If you’re also travelling to South Africa, your passport must have 2 additional blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Eswatini without a visa for up to 30 days.

You can [apply for a 30-day extension](https://www.gov.sz/index.php/services-sp-22242747/visa) from the Ministry of Home Affairs. If you want to stay longer than 60 days, you must apply for a [temporary residence permit](https://www.gov.sz/index.php/services-sp-22242747/permits).

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Check the stamp in your passport has the correct date. If you do not have the correct dates, the Eswatini authorities may stop you from re-entering the country for up to a year.

## Health form requirement

You may need to complete a health form if travelling by air. You will be asked health related questions on arrival at the land border and at King Mswati III International Airport.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Eswatini, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Eswatini guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/214/eswatini#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Travelling with children through South Africa

If you’re travelling with children through a South African airport, see [South Africa travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/entry-requirements) for information about the documents you must carry.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Eswatini. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Entering with your own vehicle

If your vehicle is not registered in Eswatini, you must complete a customs declaration form at the border post and pay a 150 Swazi emalangeni road fund levy, E80 for a motorcycle and higher amounts for commercial vehicles. These payments can be made with South African Rands. You must always carry proof of your customs declaration and levy payment in the vehicle. Vehicles may be searched at borders.
