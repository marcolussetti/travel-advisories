# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 977 or 933 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccinations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Eswatini](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/214/eswatini-swaziland#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Eswatini](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/214/eswatini-swaziland#General_Information).

### HIV and AIDS

In 2015 UNAIDS estimated that around 210,000 adults, aged 15 or over were living with HIV in Eswatini. This is around 28.8% of adults, compared to 0.2% of adults in the UK. Take the normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Eswatini

Basic healthcare is available in Eswatini, but there are shortages of common medicines. For serious accidents and emergencies or specialised treatment, it’s likely you would need to go to South Africa. Local private hospitals can arrange evacuation if you are fully insured or you can produce funds in advance.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical evacuation to South Africa and repatriation.
