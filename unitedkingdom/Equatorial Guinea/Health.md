# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 3101 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Equatorial Guinea](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/73/equatorial-guinea#Vaccine_recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Equatorial Guinea](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/73/equatorial-guinea) including:

* malaria and dengue
* Schistosomiasis
* Zika virus

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Equatorial Guinea. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Marburg virus disease (MVD)

In June 2023, the outbreak of [Marburg virus disease](https://www.who.int/health-topics/marburg-virus-disease/#tab=tab_1) was declared over by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Equatorial Guinea government. No new cases have been reported.

Check the latest situation with local authorities before travelling. You can find more information on Marburg virus disease from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON449), and [TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/693/marburg-virus-disease-in-equatorial-guinea).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medication.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Equatorial Guinea

Medical facilities are generally poor, apart from the La Paz hospital in Malabo. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, evacuation to Europe is likely. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
