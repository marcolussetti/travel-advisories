Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Iran

FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

## Political situation in Iran

From 13 June, Israel conducted military action against Iran. Reports suggest that a wide range of military, nuclear and civil installations across the country were hit, with major cities affected. On 22 June the US also launched military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. On 24 June a ceasefire began. UK staff have returned to Iran after they were temporarily withdrawn in June. This is a fragile situation with the potential to deteriorate further, quickly and without warning.

## Limited UK government support

UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. No face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
