Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Iran

FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

## Protests

Protests have been taking place in a number of locations across Iran. There are reports of violence and fatalities, as well as the arrest and detention of protesters by the Iranian authorities.

There is ongoing disruption to communications across Iran, with severe limitations on internet access. Some international flights have also been cancelled. Check with your airline for further information.

If you are at or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Even if you avoid protests and crowds, British nationals face a very high risk of arrest, questioning and detention in Iran. Monitor media for further updates.

## Political situation in Iran

In June, Israel and the US conducted military action against Iran targeting a wide range of military, nuclear and civil installations across the country. On 24 June a ceasefire began, however, this remains a fragile situation with the potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning.

## Limited UK government support

UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. No face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
