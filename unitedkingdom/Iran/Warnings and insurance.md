Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Iran

FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iran/safety-and-security).

## Regional escalation

Regional escalation poses significant security risks. We continue to advise against all travel to Iran.

British nationals should:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, stay indoors or find the nearest safe building or designated shelter. An interior stairwell or a room with as few external walls or windows as possible may provide additional protection

## If you are in Iran

Air, sea and land routes are under the control of the Iranian authorities. Ports and borders may close at short notice.

British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals face a very high risk of arrest, detention and questioning.

Holding a British passport or having perceived connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years of imprisonment.

### Travel by air

Iranian airspace remains closed.

### Travel by land

Iran’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign travellers and may close at short notice. If you plan to depart Iran across a land border and consider it safe to do so, check the travel advice of the country you intend to enter before travelling to the border, including visa requirements.

Entry to countries bordering Iran is not straightforward, and some countries will ask for additional paperwork for British passport holders. If you intend to leave overland you do so at your own risk. Should you require assistance, including with additional paperwork, [contact the FCDO](https://www.contact.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/home).

### Armenia-Iran border crossing

British nationals do not need a visa for Armenia for stays of up to 180 days per year. Check our [travel advice for Armenia](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/armenia) for the latest information.

### Azerbaijan-Iran border crossing

To cross this border, FCDO must register your details with the Azerbaijani authorities in advance so that we can provide you with a registration code. You will also require a visa to enter Azerbaijan. Read [travel advice for Azerbaijan](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/azerbaijan) for the latest information.

### Turkey-Iran

The border remains open visa-free for people travelling on UK or Iranian passports (for stays of up to 90 days). If you are a British national intending to cross the land border from Iran into Turkey, you must request facilitation from the British Embassy in Ankara [by contacting the FCDO](https://www.contact.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/home) before travelling to the border. You must state which border point you intend to use and provide personal details (name, date of birth, details of travel document used to enter Turkey).  Also indicate whether you are contacting from Iran or from the UK on behalf of a relative.

The Turkish authorities advise that the Iranians have closed the crossing point at Esendere-Serow on the Iranian side to daily traders entering and exiting over the course of a day.

### Turkmenistan-Iran border crossing

To cross this border, you require special permission from the Turkmenistan authorities in advance. This can be facilitated by the British Embassy in Ashgabat by [contacting the FCDO](https://www.contact.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/home). Without their prior approval, you will not be allowed to cross the border. Check our [travel advice for Turkmenistan](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/turkmenistan) for the latest information.

## Protests

Protests have been taking place in a number of locations across Iran. There are reports of violence and fatalities, as well as the arrest and detention of protesters by the Iranian authorities.

There is ongoing disruption to communications across Iran, with severe limitations on internet access. Some international flights have also been cancelled. Check with your airline for further information.

If you are at or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Even if you avoid protests and crowds, British nationals face a very high risk of arrest, questioning and detention in Iran. Monitor media for further updates.

## Limited UK government support

UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. No face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.

Due to the ongoing security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
