Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Iran

FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

## Political situation in Iran

In June, Israel and the US conducted military action against Iran targeting a wide range of military, nuclear and civil installations across the country. On 24 June a ceasefire began, however, this remains a fragile situation with the potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning.

## Limited UK government support

UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. No face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
