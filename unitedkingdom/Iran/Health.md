# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 115 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Iran](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/107/iran#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you will face in Iran](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/107/iran), including:

* malaria and dengue
* schistosomiasis

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Iran. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Iran

In general, medical facilities in Iran are reasonable in the major cities but poor in remote areas. Many health professionals speak some English.

There have been reported shortages of some basic medicines in Iran.

If you’re a British national in Iran having medical or cosmetic treatment, you may not get adequate care in an emergency.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Iran](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iran-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.
