# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the US](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/235/usa#Vaccine_Recommendations) (or the [US Virgin Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/242/virgin-islands-usa#Vaccine_Recommendations), [Puerto Rico](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/182/puerto-rico#Vaccine_Recommendations) and [American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/263/american-samoa-guam-northern-mariana-islands#Vaccine_Recommendations))
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the US](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/235/usa#General_Information) (or the [US Virgin Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/242/virgin-islands-usa#General_Information), [Puerto Rico](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/182/puerto-rico#General_Information) and [American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/263/american-samoa-guam-northern-mariana-islands#General_Information)), including:

* Zika virus
* West Nile virus

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of the US. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

You cannot take some prescription drugs into the US. The US Food and Drug Administration provides information on [bringing medicines into the US](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm).

UK prescriptions are not valid in the US. To get pharmacy drugs, you need a prescription from a US provider (available from an urgent care facility, emergency room or a doctor).

TravelHealthPro explains [best practice when travelling with medicines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

## Healthcare in the US

Medical treatment is expensive and there are no special arrangements for British visitors.

Some hospitals ask non-US residents to pay a deposit when admitted. Send any requests for funds to your travel insurance provider first; only pay the hospital if you’re advised to do so by your travel insurance company. Your medical care will not be affected while your claim is processed.

Medical facilities in American Samoa are basic and you may need medical evacuation by air ambulance to Hawaii, New Zealand or Australia.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
