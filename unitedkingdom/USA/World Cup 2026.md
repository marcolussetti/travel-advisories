# World Cup 2026

The FIFA World Cup takes place in the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July 2026. If you are travelling to attend:

* sign up to get [email updates](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/email-signup) on travel advice for USA
* download the official FIFA World Cup 26 app (on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fifa-world-cup-26/id6476561442) and on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fifa.tournament&hl=en)), and check the official [World Cup 2026 website](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/articles/fifa-world-cup-2026-hosts-cities-dates-usa-mexico-canada) to stay informed of anything that might affect your travel or plans whilst in the US
* entry requirements, and local laws and customs, will likely be different for each of the countries co-hosting the tournament. If you are planning to visit or transit through more than one country, check the [Travel advice page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) for each country

In the US, matches will be hosted in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. Expect other cities and popular tourist destinations across the US to be busier than usual during the tournament.

## Visa and entry requirements

Check the [entry requirements](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/entry-requirements) for the US, especially information on passport validity, visa requirements and applying for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

See [US Embassy London](https://uk.usembassy.gov/fifa-world-cup-26/) World Cup 2026 page for the latest information.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.

## Match tickets and stadium entry

Only purchase tickets through the official FIFA ticketing platform; no tickets will be sold at stadiums. To enter the stadium, you will need an official ticket on the FIFA World Cup app. Printed copies or screenshots may not be accepted at stadium gates. Each ticket is linked to the purchaser’s details, and ID checks may be required upon entry.

Tickets sold on unofficial resale websites, social media, or through third-party vendors may not be genuine. Fraudulent tickets can look legitimate but may be rejected at the stadium gate, leaving you without entry on match day. Some scammers sell the same ticket to multiple buyers or resell tickets that have already been voided by FIFA Ticketing. Even if a ticket scans at the gate, you may be denied entry if it is flagged as invalid or already used. Unofficial sources often inflate prices significantly, especially for high-demand matches like play-offs or rivalry matchups without any guarantee of authenticity.

Ensure you check the stadium’s code of conduct for any match you are attending. This sets out what you can bring into the World Cup stadiums.

Check the official [FIFA World Cup 2026 ticketing page](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/tickets) for more information.

## Accommodation

There will be a very high demand for accommodation. Plan ahead to ensure you have accommodation during your stay.

## Transport to and from the events

Transport routes around the stadiums will be very busy during the tournament. Local authorities may ask you to enter or leave the stadium by specific routes. Make sure you:

* plan your journey
* leave plenty of time, particularly on match days

If you’re planning to hire a car or use taxis in the US, check the ‘Transport Risks’ section on the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/safety-and-security#transport-risks) for more information.

## Fan zones and public viewings

During the World Cup 2026, the FIFA Fan Festival will be the central fan destination for local communities as well as fans around the globe. Fan Zones and Public Viewing areas will also be available across the US. There may be restrictions on what you can take into football viewing venues and live viewing areas, and restrictions may vary between states.

Check the official [World Cup 2026 website](https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/canadamexicousa2026/fifa-fan-festival) for information about the FIFA Fan Festival, Fan Zones and Public Viewing areas.

## Laws and cultural differences

US states may have different laws. While you are in a state, you are subject to both that state’s laws and national (federal) law. Not following all US state and federal laws can put your visa status and future travel to the US at risk.

Check the ‘Laws and cultural differences’ section on the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/safety-and-security#laws-and-cultural-differences).

### Drugs and alcohol regulations

The national legal age for buying alcohol is 21. The laws relating to the purchase and consumption of alcohol and drugs can differ between states and countries.

See more advice on the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/safety-and-security).
