# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Burkina Faso’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Burkina Faso set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Embassy of Burkina Faso in Brussels](https://www.ambassadeduburkinafaso.be/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay and have 2 blank pages for entry stamps.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).
