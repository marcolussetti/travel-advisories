# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 or 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest information on [vaccine recommendations for Antigua and Barbuda](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/10/antigua-and-barbuda#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Antigua and Barbuda](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/10/antigua-and-barbuda).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Antigua and Barbuda

The main government hospital can cope with many types of treatment but serious cases may need an emergency evacuation. Medical treatment in Antigua and Barbuda can be expensive.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, check their policies on pre-payment. Private clinics may not accept medical travel insurance as payment for treatment.
