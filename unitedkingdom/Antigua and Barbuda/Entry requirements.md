# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Antigua and Barbuda’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Antigua and Barbuda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Antigua and Barbuda High Commission in the UK](http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Antigua and Barbuda, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Antigua and Barbuda without a visa. On entry, you’ll be allowed to stay for a maximum period of 90 days.

### Applying for a visa

To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must apply and pay for an extension of stay through the [Antigua and Barbuda Immigration Department](https://immigration.gov.ag/visa-services/general-visa-information/).

It is illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

## Checks at border control

The Antiguan and Barbudan authorities advise travellers to use [ArriveAntigua.com](https://arriveantigua.com/no_desktop) to speed up your entry into the country, though it is not mandatory. You can only access it through a mobile telephone or tablet and within 72 hours of travel.

## Airport tax

Most airlines include departure tax in their flight costs. If you’re flying on regional airlines, you should check whether tax is included before you travel.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Antigua and Barbuda, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Antigua and Barbuda guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/10/antigua-and-barbuda#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Antigua and Barbuda](https://vcbia.com/customs-and-immigration/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
