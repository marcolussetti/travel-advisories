# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Botswana’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Botswana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Botswana High Commission in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Botswana, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 3 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

This will record your date and port of entry. Unstamped passports will raise suspicions of illegal entry.

### Dual nationals

Dual nationals must enter Botswana on the same passport they used to exit the previous country.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Botswana for up to 90 days without a visa.

If you want to work, study or volunteer in Botswana, see the [requirements for business, study and employment visas](https://www.gov.bw/immigration-civil-registration?txterm=114).

Overstaying a visa or a permitted visit can cause a delay to your departure. If you want to extend your stay, contact Botswana’s [Department of Immigration](https://www.gov.bw/contact-us).

### Travelling with children

You must have an original or certified copy of the full birth certificate of any child aged 17 or under when you enter or leave the country.

Any parent not present must sign an affidavit giving their consent for the child to travel. For more information contact the [Botswana High Commission in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Botswana, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For more details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Botswana guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/33/botswana#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Botswana. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into Botswana

Declare foreign or local cash currency if the value is 10,000 Botswana pula or more. If you do not, you could be liable to prosecution.
