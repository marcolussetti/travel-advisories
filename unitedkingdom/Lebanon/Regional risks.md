# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Lebanon. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/warnings-and-insurance) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/safety-and-security).

## Southern suburbs of Beirut

FCDO advises against all travel to the southern suburbs of Beirut due to the presence of armed groups and heightened risk of organised crime including kidnapping.

Weapons are common in these areas and groups such as Lebanese Hizballah have arms that are beyond state control. There have been Israeli airstrikes in the southern suburbs of Beirut since the cessation of hostilities was agreed in November 2024.

## Areas in the South and Nabatiyeh Governorates

Since 7 October 2023, there has been frequent artillery fire and airstrikes in Lebanon, most of which (but not all) have been in the South and Nabatiyeh Governorates. Although a cessation of hostilities was agreed in November 2024, strikes have continued in these areas in 2025 targeting Lebanese Hizballah operations. Further strikes cannot be ruled out.

There is a UN peacekeeping presence in the area south of the Litani River due to tensions between Lebanon and Israel.

The Israeli Defence Forces retain a presence in locations along the boundary between Lebanon and Israel. British Nationals should be aware that Israeli Defences Forces have fired at civilians who have ignored their instructions to leave these areas.

## Areas in the Beqaa Governorate, including the Beqaa Valley

FCDO advises against all travel to areas in the Beqaa Governorate (as described in ‘Warnings and insurance’ page) due to risks from criminal activity in these areas.

Since 26 February 2024, there have been several IDF airstrikes in the Beqaa Valley, including in the city of Baalbek. There is a risk of further strikes in the area.

## Areas in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate

British Nationals should be vigilant to heightened risks from criminal activity in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. From January 2025, there have been deadly armed clashes between Lebanese and Syrian groups in border towns near Hermel.

The Lebanese Armed Forces have conducted raids against narcotics factories in Baalbek, resulting in the death of numerous soldiers. Since 11 March 2024, there have been airstrikes close to the highway and near to the border with Syria. Further strikes cannot be ruled out in this area.

## Palestinian refugee camps

FCDO advises against all travel to the 12 Palestinian refugee camps. See [Palestinian refugee camp locations](https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon) on the UN Relief and Works Agency website.

Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order. There has been a long pattern of violent clashes.

In September 2023, Ain el Hilweh camp witnessed intense violence resulting in a number of casualties. There were reports of bullets reaching as far as Ghaziyeh Town (2km south). Tensions remain high and could escalate without warning. There have been Israeli airstrikes on Palestinian refugee camps, including a strike on Ain el Hilweh camp on 18 November 2025 which reportedly killed 13 people.

## Akkar Governorate including the city of Tripoli

FCDO advises against all travel to the Akkar district. This includes the area 5km from the Syrian border due to the unstable security situation in Syria. The Israeli Defence Forces have carried out airstrikes in the area near the Syrian border. Further airstrikes cannot be ruled out.

FCDO advises against all travel to Tripoli due to the risk of violent clashes between armed groups and counter-terrorism operations.
