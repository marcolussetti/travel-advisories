For further information on why we advise against travel, see [Conflict affecting Lebanon](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon#conflict-in-neighbouring-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-opts) and [Regional risks.](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/regional-risks).

## Regional risks

There is a heightened risk of regional tension. Escalation could lead to travel disruption and other unanticipated impacts.

British nationals should take sensible precautions, considering their own individual circumstances. These include:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* sign up to local information alerts/resources and follow the instructions of the local authorities
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities

## Conflict affecting Lebanon

Although a ceasefire in the conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hizballah came into force on 27 November 2024, the security environment remains unpredictable. Israeli Defence Forces continue to conduct airstrikes and artillery fire at targets in Lebanon, including the South, near the Israeli and Syrian borders, and in the Nabatiyeh and Beqaa Governates north of the Litani River. The closure or disruption of roads and exit routes at short notice could affect your ability to leave the country. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.

The security situation presents a range of serious risks to British Nationals in Lebanon, including the following.

### Military activity across Lebanon

There are ongoing airstrikes, and artillery fire across Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel and the Beqaa Valley, but there have also been some in the South and in the Nabatiyeh Governates north of the Litani river. Strikes in other areas of the country cannot be ruled out, including in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Strikes have resulted in civilian casualties and the destruction of residential buildings. There are strikes both in population centres and in rural areas. Be aware that the Israeli Defence Force is continuing to tell people not to return to areas in the south close to the Blue Line. There are reported incidences of the Israeli Defences Forces firing on people who get too close to locations where they retain a presence.

We advise you to keep up to date with the latest situation including using multiple media sources to understand frequency and location of strikes as these may change rapidly. There are various mapping sources available online.

### Access to Beirut airport

Beirut airport is open and operational. If you are travelling to the airport, check the local security situation before you travel. Remain alert to local conditions as these could change quickly.

### Civil disorder

Celebratory gunfire is common in Lebanon and there is a risk from gunfire being fired in residential areas in reaction to major regional developments. If you hear gunfire, take cover immediately. Protests related to regional events could also take place at short notice and may escalate quickly. Exercise caution, avoid demonstrations, and monitor local media for developments.

### Local support

The Embassy is open as normal and continues with essential work, including full services to British nationals.

Keep up to date with local and international media including TV and radio stations such as Virgin Radio Lebanon (FM 89.5) and Voice of Lebanon / Sawt Lubnan (FM 100.3 - 100.5) which may be useful sources of information on any developments.

You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government. This may include the ability to leave quickly or to shelter in place if you judge it necessary and safe to do so.

Read FCDO advice on what to do [if you’re affected by a crisis abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas) and how to prepare.

## Help and support in Lebanon

You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.

If you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +961 (0)1 960 800.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
