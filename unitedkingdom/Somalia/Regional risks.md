# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Somalia. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/somalia) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/somalia/safety-and-security).

## Togdheer, Sanaag and Sool

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to the regions of Toghdeer, Sanaag and Sool in eastern Somaliland. There has been an increase in violent clashes in recent months and the situation remains volatile, so if you do travel, exercise extreme caution.

## Awdal, Maroodijeh and Sahil

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the 3 western regions of Somaliland – Awdal (including Boorama), Maroodijeh (including Hargeisa) and Sahil (including Berbera).

## Border areas

Check with local authorities before travelling to the border, and monitor travel advice for your destination: Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. If you try to cross the border without the correct documents, officials may stop you.

Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. You may get a fine or detention for illegally crossing borders. The land border with Kenya is currently closed due to recent cross border terrorist activity. There have been reports that foreign nationals have been prevented from crossing the Djiboutian border into Somalia, though the border remains open.

## The rest of Somalia

FCDO advises against all travel to the rest of Somalia. There is ongoing, serious violence between opposing factions in many parts of the country. Civilians of all ages have been killed in fighting, which often involves heavy weapons.
