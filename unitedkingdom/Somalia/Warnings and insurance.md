Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Parts of Somalia, including eastern Somaliland

FCDO advises against all travel to Somalia, including the 3 eastern regions of Somaliland – Togdheer, Sanaag and Sool – and excluding the 3 western regions of Somaliland – Awdal, Maroodijeh and Sahil. This is due to the threat from terrorist groups and continuing violence.

### Western Somaliland

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the 3 western regions of Somaliland – Awdal (including Boorama), Maroodijeh (including Hargeisa) and Sahil (including Berbera).

## Support from FCDO

Support from FCDO is severely limited in Somalia, including Somaliland, with no support in person from staff at the British Embassy Mogadishu or the British Office Hargeisa.

If you need urgent help from the UK government, for example if you’ve been arrested or you’re concerned about forced marriage, contact:

* the [British High Commission Nairobi, Kenya](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-nairobi) if you are in Somalia, excluding Somaliland
* the [British Embassy Addis Ababa, Ethiopia](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-addis-ababa) if you are in Somaliland

If you’re in the UK and are concerned about a British national in Somalia, including Somaliland, call FCDO on 020 7008 5000.

## People of Somali descent, including Somaliland descent

The government of Somalia and the authorities in Somaliland will consider any British national of Somali (including Somaliland) descent to be a dual national. FCDO can offer only limited consular support in these cases.
