# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK, who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Somalia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Somalia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Somalian Embassy in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Somalia, including Somaliland, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to enter Somalia, including Somaliland.

If you are travelling to Mogadishu International Airport, you will need to apply for an [eVisa](https://etas.gov.so/) prior to your arrival.

If you are travelling to Hargeisa International Airport, you may still be asked to present this [eVisa](https://etas.gov.so/) in order to board your flight but it will not be considered valid for entry when you arrive in Hargeisa.

You will need to purchase a single-entry visa upon arrival at Hargeisa International Airport, which will be valid for one month.

It is not clear if you’ll be given a visa on arrival at other points of entry. Get confirmation from local authorities or your sponsoring organisation.

You may also need to provide a letter of invitation when you arrive, outlining the reason for your visit. You can usually get this from your place of work. Without this letter, you may not be allowed to enter.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Somalia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/200/somalia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Somalia, including Somaliland. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

Khat is a legal drug in Somalia, but it is an offence to take it out of the country. Officials regularly search bags at Hargeisa and Mogadishu airports, and anyone found to be in possession of khat is likely to face criminal prosecution.

### Taking money into and out of Somalia (including Somaliland)

In Somaliland you must declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more.
