# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 610600 or 117 and ask for an ambulance.

Emergency numbers are unreliable in the Central African Republic. The emergency services are unlikely to respond outside of Bangui.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the Central African Republic](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/46/central-african-republic#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the Central African Republic](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/46/central-african-republic), including:

* yellow fever
* malaria
* cholera
* Zika virus
* mpox

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in the Central African Republic

There are very few healthcare facilities in the Central African Republic. Facilities in Bangui are very basic. Strikes by government workers have affected medical services and hospitals. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation, including medical evacuation by air ambulance.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in the Central African Republic](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-medical-facilities-and-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in the Central African Republic](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-in-central-african-republic/living-in-central-african-republic#healthcare-in-central-african-republic).
