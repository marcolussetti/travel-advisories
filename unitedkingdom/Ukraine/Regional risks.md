# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Ukraine. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/warnings-and-insurance) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/safety-and-security).

## Crimea and eastern Ukraine

FCDO advises against all travel to all regions in eastern Ukraine, including any Ukrainian territories which are temporarily under Russian control. FCDO is not able to provide in-person assistance to anyone in these regions.

## Border with Belarus

FCDO advises against all travel to within 50km of the border with Belarus in the regions of:

* Volyn
* Rivne
* Zhytomyr

This is due to the ongoing presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security personnel on the Belarusian side of the border.

## All other regions of Ukraine

FCDO advises against all travel to all other regions of Ukraine except for specific regions of western Ukraine (see below). This includes any areas temporarily under Russian control such as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.

## Western regions

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the regions of:

* Zakarpattia
* Ivano-Frankivsk
* Ternopil
* Chernivtsi
* Lviv
* Volyn
* Rivne
* Zhytomyr

In the event of attacks, follow the advice of the local authorities, including responding to air raid sirens.

### To enter or exit Crimea

In theory foreign nationals need to provide their passport and a special permit issued by the territorial body of the [State Migration Service of Ukraine](https://dmsu.gov.ua/en-home.html). However, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is not currently possible for foreign nationals to enter or exit Crimea.

The Crimean sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Yalta and Yevpatoria have been designated by the Ukrainian authorities as closed to international shipping.
