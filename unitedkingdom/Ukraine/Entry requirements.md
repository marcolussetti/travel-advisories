# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Ukraine’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Ukraine set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Ukrainian Embassy in the UK](https://mfa.gov.ua/en/embassies/velika-britaniya). The Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has the final decision on whether a person is eligible to enter Ukraine.

## Permanent residents

If you are a permanent resident of Ukraine, you do not need to show proof of insurance.

## Passport validity requirements

If you’re travelling without a visa, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. If you’re applying for a visa, your passport may need to have an additional period of validity. Check with the [Ukrainian Embassy in the UK](https://mfa.gov.ua/en/embassies/velika-britaniya) for further details.

### Additional requirements at the border

At the border you will need to:

* complete an [immigration card](https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/Procedure-for-filling-immigration-card)
* scan your fingerprints as part of biometric data collection at border crossing points if requested by the immigration officer
* have evidence of sufficient funds. You can show:
  + cash
  + bank cards with bank statements
  + accommodation bookings
  + tourist vouchers
  + a letter of financial support from your sponsor
  + return or onward travel tickets

You can find more information on:

* [Ukrainian Embassy in the UK](https://uk.mfa.gov.ua/en/consular-issues/4409-visa-requirements-for-foreigners-entering-ukraine)
* [State Border Guard Service of Ukraine](http://dpsu.gov.ua/en/border-crossing-by-foreigners-and-stateless-persons)

## Visa requirements

British Citizen passport holders can enter Ukraine without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Ukraine has confirmed that this policy will continue to apply to British citizens until 30 January 2026.

If you’re planning to stay in Ukraine for longer than 90 days in a 180 day period, you need to get a visa. For more advice contact the [Ukrainian Embassy in London](https://mfa.gov.ua/en/embassies/velika-britaniya) or [Consulate General in Edinburgh](https://edinburgh.mfa.gov.ua/en).

### Expired residence cards

If you have a temporary or permanent residence card that’s expired, you are still allowed to return to Ukraine. The expired document will remain valid while martial law remains in place and for 30 days afterwards. For more information see the [Visit Ukraine website](https://visitukraine.today/blog/1063/an-expired-residence-permit-gives-the-right-to-enter-ukraine-new-conditions-and-exceptions) or contact the [State Migration Service of Ukraine](https://dmsu.gov.ua/en-home.html).

### Visa overstays

If you need to extend your stay in Ukraine, check with the State Migration Service. If you overstay the 90 day allowance, you will be fined and may not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country.

## Non-government controlled areas

If you intend to go to any of the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities, you must apply to the [State Migration Service](https://www.dmsu.gov.ua/).

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Ukraine guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/232/ukraine#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Accommodation

The ongoing invasion has severely affected the availability of accommodation. You should book and confirm accommodation in advance. Find further information at [Visit Ukraine](https://visitukraine.today/).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into and out of Ukraine](https://customs.gov.ua/en/) (in Ukrainian), including antiques and items of historical interest. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. If in doubt seek prior permission from the [customs authorities](https://customs.gov.ua/en/contacts).

### Bringing your car to Ukraine

Non-residents are allowed to bring a vehicle for personal use into Ukraine for up to one year. There’s no need to complete a customs declaration form. The vehicle can only be used in Ukraine by the person that brought it into the country. An undeclared vehicle cannot be:

* used for commercial purposes
* dismantled
* sold
* rented to other people
* used to travel through Ukraine

If you want to do any of these things, you’ll need to register the vehicle in Ukraine and pay the appropriate customs duty.

You must take the vehicle out of Ukraine within the required timeframe, or place it into the customs regime of the State.

If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed, you should inform the State Customs Service and provide them with evidence that it cannot be repaired. You may then dispose of the vehicle through the official channels of the State Customs Service.

For further information on bringing your car to Ukraine, [contact the State Customs Service of Ukraine](https://customs.gov.ua/contacts).

## Crossing international borders

It is illegal to enter internationally recognised Ukrainian territory through a border point that is not currently controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. If you do, you risk arrest or a fine, and a travel ban.

International border crossings that are not currently under the control of the Ukrainian authorities include:

* all land border crossings into Donetsk region
* all land border crossings and seaports in Luhansk region
* all seaports in Kherson region east of the Dnipro river
* all airports and seaports in Crimea and the Kerch Bridge road and rail crossing into Crimea
