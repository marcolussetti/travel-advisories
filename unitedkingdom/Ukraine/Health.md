# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Ukraine](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/232/ukraine#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

### Pharmacies

Due to the ongoing invasion, some supply chains are interrupted, and some medical products are hard to come by. Information on which pharmacies are operational is provided by local authorities and pharmacy networks.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Health operates a hotline at +380 (0)800 60 20 19 to coordinate access to insulin and other critical medicines for those who need it. The service [Tabletki.ua](http://Tabletki.ua) is continuing to operate and tries to maintain hourly updates about availability of medicines nationwide.

Pharmacies may close without notice. Maintain a stock of essential medication. Pharmacies in smaller towns may not have the same variety of medications available in the bigger cities. Pharmacies are usually easily identifiable by the presence of a green cross or the word ‘apteka’ (аптека). Some stronger medications require a prescription from a doctor, written in Ukrainian.

## Healthcare in Ukraine

FCDO has a list of [healthcare providers in Ukraine](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-kyiv). Due to the ongoing invasion, we cannot confirm that all these providers are operating.

State medical facilities in Ukraine are generally poor. Private clinics and hospitals offer a better standard of care, though these do not always meet western standards and practices. If you require emergency medical treatment, it is likely that you will be taken to a state hospital unless you can show that you have comprehensive medical insurance cover.

English is not widely spoken and you may face communication difficulties if you do not speak Ukrainian.

## Travel and mental health
