# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of St Lucia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in St Lucia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [St Lucian High Commission in the UK](https://www.govt.lc/ministries/external-affairs-international-trade-and-civil-aviation/high-commission-for-saint-lucia).

## Passport validity requirements

If you’re visiting St Lucia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ after the day you plan to leave.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not stayed longer than you’re allowed.

## Visa requirements

You can visit St Lucia without a visa.

On entry, you’ll be allowed to stay for a maximum period of 6 weeks.

To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must [meet the St Lucian government’s entry requirements](https://externalaffairs.gov.lc/extension-of-stay/). You’ll need to go to the Immigration Department in Castries to apply to extend your stay.

It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

## Online immigration form

Fill in an [online immigration form](https://www.stlucia.org/en_UK/entry/) no more than 3 days before you arrive. If you do not complete it before you arrive, you’ll be asked to fill in the electronic form on arrival or fill in a paper form, if available.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter St Lucia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).
