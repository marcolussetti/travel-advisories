# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if youâ€™re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for St Lucia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/208/st-lucia#Vaccine_recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Carry a copy of your prescription for any medications you bring with you, especially any that may be classed as controlled drugs.

## Healthcare in St Lucia

The main government hospital can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may mean emergency evacuation.

Medical treatment in St Lucia can be expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, check their policies on pre-payment. Some private clinics may not accept medical travel insurance as payment for treatment. The Tapion Hospital does not accept travel or foreign medical insurance for payment.
