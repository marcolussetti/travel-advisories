# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Niger’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Niger set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Niger Consulate in the UK](https://nigerconsulate.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity is needed.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You will need a visa to enter Niger. You can apply for a visa from the Nigerien embassy in Geneva.

Visit the [embassy website](https://www.ambassade-niger-geneve.net/visas.html) for application forms, payment, and more information on requirements.

## Enhanced security checks

 Nigerien authorities have conducted enhanced security checks on foreign nationals arriving into Niger. In some cases, passports have been withheld for several days.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Niger, you must have a certificate to [prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

## Customs rules
