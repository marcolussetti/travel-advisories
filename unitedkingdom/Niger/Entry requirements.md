# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Niger’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Niger set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Niger Consulate in the UK](https://nigerconsulate.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity is needed.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You will need a visa to enter Niger. You can apply for a visa from the Nigerien embassy in Geneva.

Visit the [embassy website](https://www.ambassade-niger-geneve.net/visas.html) for application forms, payment, and more information on requirements.

## Enhanced security checks

## Vaccine requirements
