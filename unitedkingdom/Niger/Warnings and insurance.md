Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the capital city of Niamey, and advises against all travel to the rest of Niger.

The political situation remains unstable following the military coup in July 2023. Further instability is possible.

There is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps, particularly outside the capital of Niamey.

## Limited UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Niger. Assistance is provided remotely from the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos. In-person assistance is not available.

If there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it could be difficult to leave safely.

Do not rely on the UK government to evacuate you as they may not be able to do so. Have your own plans on how you would leave the country, make sure you keep all travel documentation up to date and monitor the local situation.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
