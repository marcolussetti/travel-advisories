# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Niger. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/niger) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/niger/safety-and-security).

Outside of Niamey there is a greater risk of terrorist attack and risk of kidnapping is high. The FCDO is unable to provide current and accurate information on the specific threat and risks in the regions outside Niamey.

### Escort requirement

Outside of Niamey you must be escorted by Nigerien security and military forces. We recommend that British Nationals who decide to travel to Niger remain within the city limits of Niamey.

There is a lack of infrastructure in rural and desert areas increasing the safety risks. [See road travel.](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/niger/safety-and-security)

## Border areas and Northern Niger

Terrorists operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and throughout northern Niger. Avoid travel to Niger’s border regions, particularly the Tillaberi and Diffa regions.  [See Terrorism.](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/niger/safety-and-security)
