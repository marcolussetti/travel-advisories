# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 15 and ask for an ambulance.

Public emergency services can be slow to respond. Some private medical clinics also have ambulance services.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Niger](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/164/niger#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Niger](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/164/niger), including:

* yellow fever
* malaria and dengue
* schistosomiasis

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Niger

Medical facilities are poor, even in Niamey. Serious medical treatment would require evacuation to Europe. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

Private hospitals and clinics include:

* Polyclinic Magori (+227 2074 1291, or +227 2074 3347 in an emergency)
* Clinique Gamkalley (+227 9696 4886, or +227 2073 4639 in an emergency)

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
