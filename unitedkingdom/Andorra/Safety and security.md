# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Andorra

Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Andorra, attacks cannot be ruled out.

## Crime

### Protecting your belongings

Street crime is rare, but you should:

* take care of your personal belongings
* not keep money and valuables all in one place
* keep a copy of your passport somewhere safe

### Drink and food spiking

Be aware of the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including GHB and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them to make sure they are not spiked.

## Laws and cultural differences

### Alcohol laws

It is illegal to drink alcohol in the street.

### Illegal drugs

Andorra has a zero-tolerance policy on the possession and use of illegal drugs. Punishment for possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can include refusal of entry, expulsion from the country, fines and prison sentences.

### LGBT+ travellers

Andorra is a generally tolerant place for LGBT+ travellers. Same-sex marriage is legal in Andorra. Transgender people can register under their preferred sex in public documents without undergoing prior gender reassignment surgery.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Andorra, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad) and check the [rules of the road in the RAC’s Andorra guide](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/andorra/). The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.

You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Andorra. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to [update it to a photocard licence](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence) or get the [correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit) as well.

Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.

Andorra has stricter drink-driving laws than many other countries, including the UK. You can get a fine of up to 600 euros and a 2-month driving ban. The Andorra authorities can also impound your vehicle.

Check if you need a [UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK](https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-identifiers-and-stickers).

From 1 November to 15 May, you must use winter tyres or carry snow chains in Andorra. You can get a fine if you do not. Winter tyres have a snowflake icon on the wall of the tyre.
