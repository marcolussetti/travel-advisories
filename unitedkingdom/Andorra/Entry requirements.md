# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Andorra set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Andorra Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.exteriors.ad/en).

## Travelling through France or Spain

You must travel through France or Spain to enter Andorra. Check the entry requirements for [France](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements) or [Spain](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain/entry-requirements) before you travel.

## Passport validity requirements

To travel to Andorra, you must follow the [Schengen area passport requirements](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Andorra is not in the Schengen area, but you must travel through a Schengen area country to reach Andorra, either [France](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france) or [Spain](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain).

Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

Check visa requirements in [France travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements#visa-requirements) or [Spain travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain/entry-requirements#visa-requirements), as you’ll travel through one of those countries to reach Andorra. You must meet the requirements for entry to the Schengen Area in order to enter France or Spain for onward travel to Andorra, even if you have Andorran residency.

You do not need a visa to enter Andorra.

The Andorran Ministry of Foreign Affairs has further [information on entering Andorra](https://www.exteriors.ad/en/travel-to-andorra).

To stay longer than 3 months, you must go in person to the Andorran immigration department to [apply for a work or residence permit](https://www.immigracio.ad/ca/tramits-d-immigracio) (in Catalan).

## Travelling with children

Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should bring a copy of any custody documents or written authorisation from the other parent.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Andorra guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/6/andorra#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Registering with the police

Hotels and tourist apartments must register the names of all overnight guests with the police. You must provide your passport details.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods that can be brought into and taken out of Andorra](https://visitandorra.com/en/visitor-information/before-you-arrive/passport-visas-customs/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

Andorra is not a member of the EU. You may have to pay taxes and duties on tobacco, liquor and luxury goods when you re-enter France and Spain.

France and Spain have strict rules on the amount of tobacco exported from Andorra for personal use. Customs officers may impound excess amounts of tobacco and the vehicle transporting it.
