# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Zambia. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/zambia) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/zambia/safety-and-security).

## Zambia-DRC border

Take care when travelling in rural parts of Zambia, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The border is not demarcated and there is a risk of inadvertently illegally entering DRC.

Legitimate border crossings in these areas are generally safe.
