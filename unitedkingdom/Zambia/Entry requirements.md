# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Zambia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Zambia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Zambian High Commission in the UK](https://www.facebook.com/zhclondon/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Zambia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It must have at least 2 blank pages for entry stamping.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationality

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

Zambia recognises dual nationality. However, to avoid delays at the airport you should leave Zambia on the same passport you used to enter.

## Visa requirements

British passport holders do not need a visa to enter Zambia. You must be able to show:

* valid return or onward tickets
* enough money for your stay

Tourists may remain in Zambia for a total of 90 days in any 12 month period. For business visitors the maximum stay in Zambia over a 12 month period is 30 days.

For further information, email the Zambian High Commission at info@zambiahc.org.uk or contact the [Zambian Department of Immigration](https://www.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/).

### KAZA UNIVISA

The [KAZA UNIVISA,](https://www.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/kaza-univisa/) for use in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, is valid for unlimited travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and for day trips to Botswana. It costs 50 US dollars and is valid for 30 days.

You can [apply online in advance](https://eservices.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/), or get the visa on arrival if you are arriving at:

* Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, Lusaka
* Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport, Livingstone
* by land at Livingstone, Victoria Falls (Zambia-Zimbabwe border)
* by land at Kazungula (Zambia-Botswana border)

## Departure tax

On leaving Zambia, all air passengers must pay the equivalent to 25 US dollars for international travel and a security charge of 3 US dollars for domestic travel. Both charges are normally included in the cost of an air ticket, but you will have to pay in cash with Zambian kwacha if they are not.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Zambia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Zambia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/247/zambia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Zambia](https://www.zra.org.zm/importation-of-goods/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
