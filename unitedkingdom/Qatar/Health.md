# Health

Before you travel, check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Qatar](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/183/qatar#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Qatar](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/183/qatar).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

TravelHealthPro explains [best practice when travelling with medicines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

### Bringing medication into Qatar

Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines may be controlled substances in Qatar. If you need to bring controlled or prescription medication into Qatar, make sure you carry it in its original packaging, accompanied by your prescription and an official letter signed and stamped by your doctor. The letter should include:

* name of the medication
* quantity prescribed
* dosage
* why it’s required

The letter should be signed by the doctor or consultant and stamped by the hospital or surgery.

## Healthcare in Qatar

Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive. Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation to the UK or the country where you live.
