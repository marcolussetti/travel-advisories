# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Qatar’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Qatar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, [contact Qatar’s embassy in the UK](https://london.embassy.qa/en/).

## Passport validity requirements

If you are visiting Qatar, your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive. You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

If you are a resident of Qatar, your passport must be valid when you arrive.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can get a tourist visa on arrival if you’re travelling on a full British Citizen passport.

You must still get a visa in advance if:

* you’re travelling for any purpose other than tourism
* you hold [another type of British passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-subject)

If you need to stay longer than 30 days, you must extend your visa waiver before it expires through the [Qatar Ministry of Interior](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/qatarvisas). If you do not do this, you may be fined. The fine must be paid before leaving Qatar.

There is more information on visa requirements and extensions on the [Qatar Ministry of Interior website](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/qatarvisas).

### Travel bans

If you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt or are a child subject to a custody dispute, you may be prevented from leaving Qatar by the Qatari authorities.

### Transit passengers

At the airport, all bags are scanned. Transit passengers found with even residual amounts of drugs may be arrested. This includes drugs which may be legal in other countries, but not in Qatar.

Travellers cannot stay in the transit area for more than 24 hours between flights, even if you are booked into the transit hotel in the airport.

There is more information about transit through Qatar on the [Hamad International Airport website](https://dohahamadairport.com/airport-guide/at-the-airport/transfers).

## Mandatory health insurance

If you’re staying in Qatar for more than 30 days, you must buy health insurance from a [registered Ministry of Public Health ( MOPH) insurance provider](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/hirs/insurancecompanies/Pages/default.aspx) before you travel.

For more guidance see the [MOPH website.](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/Pages/Health-Insurance-Scheme.aspx)

The standard insurance premium is 50 Qatari riyals per person, per month.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Qatar, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
