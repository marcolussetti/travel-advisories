# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 101 and ask for an ambulance.

The Mauritania authorities may not answer calls to this number.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mauritania](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/144/mauritania#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Mauritania](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/144/mauritania), including:

* dengue
* yellow fever
* biting insects
* Rift Valley fever

## Medication

Many medicines may be fake or hard to find in Mauritania. Carry enough of your prescription medication for your stay. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Mauritania

Medical facilities are extremely limited in Mauritania, particularly outside Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, where lack of communications makes dealing with an emergency very difficult.

Clinics in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou charge for medical care (sometimes in euros or US dollars) and may not accept foreign insurance cards. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Mauritania](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mauritania-doctors) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Mauritania](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-mauritania).
