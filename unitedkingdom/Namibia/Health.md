# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 211111 (in Windhoek) or 10111 (everywhere else) and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Namibia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/157/namibia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Namibia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/157/namibia).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Namibia. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Namibia’s hot and dry climate can cause skin problems and dehydration. Make sure you carry a good supply of drinkable water.

Namibia has one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV in the world. In 2021 the UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 210,000 adults aged 15 or over were living with HIV. This was around 11.8% of the adult population, compared to around 0.2% of adults in the UK. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Namibia

There are good medical facilities in Windhoek. Private hospitals may insist on payment before starting treatment even if you have comprehensive travel insurance. They may ask you to pay and reclaim from your insurer later. Some travel insurance policies are not recognised by some Namibian hospitals. Check if your product is accepted in Namibia before you travel and get alternative coverage, if needed.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Namibia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/namibia-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff speak English.
