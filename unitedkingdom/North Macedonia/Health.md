# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 194 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in [TravelHealthPro’s North Macedonia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/133/north-macedonia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in North Macedonia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/133/north-macedonia), including:

* West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne diseases
* air pollution
