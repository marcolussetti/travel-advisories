# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in North Macedonia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Macedonian Embassy in the UK](https://london.mfa.gov.mk/en).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter North Macedonia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 90 days after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can visit North Macedonia for up to 3 months without a visa.

If you plan to stay for longer, contact the [Macedonian Embassy](https://london.mfa.gov.mk/en).

### Travelling with children

Before you travel, ask your airline if you need to complete any forms for children travelling:

* alone
* with only one parent
* with an adult who is not their legal guardian

If you are travelling through (transiting) other countries, check travel advice for those countries for additional requirements.

### UK refugee travel documents

If you hold a UK refugee travel document, you must have a visa to travel to North Macedonia. You also need a visa to travel through North Macedonia on your way to Kosovo. You can apply for a visa from the [Macedonian Embassy in the UK](https://london.mfa.gov.mk/en).

## Land border crossings

On 26 January, planned protests by transport associations at some land border crossings in the Western Balkans have the potential to cause significant delays. If you are planning cross-border travel, check local media before travelling and plan ahead to avoid disruption to your journey.

## Registering with the police

You must register with the local police in the town or city where you’re staying within 48 hours of your arrival in North Macedonia. If you’re staying in a hotel, staff will register you at check-in.

Keep the registration document with you until you leave North Macedonia. If you have registered with the police directly, you must de-register 24 hours before you leave the country. You can [register with the police online](https://mvr.gov.mk/prijavistrintro) (in Macedonian).

If you do not register, you may face:

* a fine
* detention and a court hearing
* a restriction on returning to North Macedonia

## Travelling to Serbia

Serbia has sometimes denied entry to people leaving North Macedonia with passport stamps from Kosovo.
