# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Cape Verde’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Cape Verde set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Cape Verdean Consulate-General in Rotterdam](https://conscv.nl/pt/)(in Portuguese) or through the [Cape Verde Consular Portal email address](https://portalconsular.mnec.gov.cv/en/contactos) (in English).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Cape Verde, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost, stolen or is damaged.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for up to 30 days without a visa.

To stay longer or to travel for other reasons, you must [meet the Cape Verde government’s entry requirements](https://portalconsular.mnec.gov.cv/en/vistos).

## Traveller entry form

You must fill in a [traveller entry form](https://www.ease.gov.cv/) at least 5 days before you arrive in the country. This form includes an airport security fee (‘TSA’), which you must pay before you arrive.

If you’re travelling with a tour operator, check whether they can complete the form for you as part of the booking process.

See [more information on the traveller entry form](https://portalconsular.mnec.gov.cv/en/perguntas-frequentes).

Children aged one and under do not need to fill in the traveller entry form.

## Travelling with children

Children aged 17 and under travelling to Cape Verde alone, or with a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, must carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter must be in Portuguese and the signature must be certified by a [solicitor](https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/) or [notary](https://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/notaries/find-a-notary/)

The letter should include:

* the child’s dates of arrival and departure
* the address where they will be staying
* the name of the adult in Cape Verde who will be responsible for them during their stay
* the full names, passport numbers and contact details of the parent or guardian
* the parent or guardian’s signature and date of issue

If you are not the parent or guardian and you bring a child to Cape Verde without a legally certified letter of authorisation, you may be refused entry.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Cape Verde, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations see [TravelHealthPro’s Cape Verde guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/43/cape-verde#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Cape Verde. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
