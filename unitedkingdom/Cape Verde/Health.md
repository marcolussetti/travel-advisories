# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need. Health care in Cape Verde is very basic and limited
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. Global Health Insurance Cards (GHIC) are not accepted in Cape Verde so it is essential that you have appropriate travel insurance.

## Emergency medical number

Call 130 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the current [vaccine recommendations for Cape Verde](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/43/cape-verde#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on [the NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face on Cape Verde](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/43/cape-verde) including dengue. The Cape Verde government has raised the civil protection warning level for dengue on the islands of Santiago, Fogo and Brava.

Altitude sickness is a risk on the island of Fogo in Cape Verde. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

You will only be able to buy medication from a pharmacy. Find a pharmacy near you on the [Ministry of Health’s list of registered pharmacies](https://www.mf.gov.cv/web/dnre/direca-geral-das-alfandegas) (in Portuguese).

If you are on medication, make sure you travel with sufficient medication for the duration of your travel. If you run out of medication and have a UK prescription, ask at a pharmacy if they can fill it for you. You may not be able to get the same strength or dosage. Some medicines are unavailable or in short supply and some may not be authorised for sale in Cape Verde.

If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital emergency department.

## Healthcare in Cape Verde

Medical facilities in Cape Verde are basic and limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. The largest hospitals are in Praia on Santiago and Mindelo on São Vicente, with smaller medical facilities and clinics located throughout the country. Medical facilities are particularly limited on the island of Boa Vista.

The islands of Brava and Santo Antão do not have working airports, so medical air evacuation is extremely difficult.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Cape Verde](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cape-verde-list-of-medical-facilities-and-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health
