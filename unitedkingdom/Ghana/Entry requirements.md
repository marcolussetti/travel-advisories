# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Ghana’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Ghana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Ghana High Commission in the UK](https://www.ghanahighcommissionuk.com/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Ghana, your passport must have an expiry date at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Ghana.

### Applying for a visa

Complete the [online visa application form on the Ghana High Commission website](https://www.ghanahighcommissionuk.com/) and make the online payment.

You need to upload your supporting documents (including a yellow fever certificate) and provide hard copies. Print out the form, add supporting documents and send them by post as directed on the website. The visa processing time is 10 to 15 days.

To get a visa in around 3 days, check if you can use the express service available in person from the [Ghana Premium Application Centre in London](https://ghanahighcommissionuk.com/london-access-premium-centre).

### Extending your visa

To extend your stay, take the [visa extension form](https://home.gis.gov.gh/gis-forms/) and photos in person to the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS) office on Independence Avenue in Accra.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Ghana, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.

For full details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Ghana guide](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/89/ghana#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Registering with the authorities

If you live in Ghana, you must register with the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana and get a [non-citizen Ghana card](https://fims.org.gh/). You must register all foreign nationals aged 6 years and above in your family who are either:

* permanently resident in Ghana
* resident in Ghana for at least 90 days in any calendar year

For more information, see [living in Ghana](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-british-people-living-in-ghana).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Ghana](https://gra.gov.gh/customs/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into Ghana

You must declare all hard currency, using the declaration form provided on arrival. You can bring in up to a maximum Ghanaian cedi equivalent of 10,000 US dollars.

Do not carry more than 10,000 dollars in value in any foreign currency. The Ghanaian authorities can [confiscate the entire amount](https://www.accra-airport.com/en/customs_accra_airport.php) if you are carrying cash of this value or more.

## Dual nationality

Ghana recognises dual nationality. Ghanaian-British dual nationals can register with the Interior Ministry in Ghana and get a dual nationality card. You can produce this card when entering Ghana to show that you do not need a visa.
