# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Ghana](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/89/ghana#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Ghana](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/89/ghana), including:

* yellow fever
* malaria
* dengue

### Marburg virus

In September 2022, Ghana declared an end to the Marburg virus disease outbreak that was first reported in July 2022. See [more details about the outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON409) and [more information on Marburg virus and similar diseases](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/68/viral-haemorrhagic-fever).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Ghana

Medical facilities are poor outside towns. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation will be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
