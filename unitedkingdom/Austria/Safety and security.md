# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Austria

Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Austria.

Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals such as:

* public transport
* national and international transport hubs
* music, sporting and cultural events
* entertainment establishments and nightlife venues
* government buildings and international institutions
* places of worship and religious sites

You should be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities.

Recent examples include:

* on 15 February 2025, one person was killed and five injured in central Villach, Carinthia, southern Austria in a knife attack.
* on 2 November 2020, four people were killed and 23 injured in a terrorism-related shooting in central Vienna.

The Austrian authorities have successfully disrupted various attack plans, making a number of arrests in recent years. You can expect to see an increased police presence, and additional safety measures may be in place. Be aware of your surroundings and follow the advice of local authorities.

## Political demonstrations

Demonstrations may happen with little or no warning in cities. Follow the advice of local authorities.

## Crime

Crime levels are generally low. However, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing, in the big city centres and city parks after dark. Thieves use a variety of methods to distract people.

### Protecting your belongings

Take care on public transport and in crowded city centres including main stations. Be particularly careful with your belongings on international trains and when you take your baggage from trains and coaches.

### Drink spiking

Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. Criminals have robbed and assaulted people after spiking their drinks.

## Laws and cultural differences

### Personal ID

By law, you must always have easy access to your passport. If you do not carry your passport, it must be in the same district as you, and you must be able to get it quickly. It can be helpful to carry a copy of the photo page. The Austrian authorities do not accept a UK driving licence as official ID.

### Illegal drugs

Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties.

You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.

Airports in Austria have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.

### Face-covering ban

It’s generally illegal to wear any clothing or object in public that covers your face. You could get a fine of up to 150 euros. See [information on Austria’s face-covering ban](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/leben_in_oesterreich/aufenthalt/Seite.120251.html), including a list of exemptions.

### Public transport

You must validate your ticket in a ticket machine before starting a journey on public transport. If you do not, you could get a 100 to 500 euro on-the-spot fine.

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

For outdoor activities and adventure sports, make sure:

* you use a well-established company
* your insurance covers your specific activity

For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example, off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing or paragliding), your insurance should include:

* mountain rescue services
* helicopter costs
* repatriation to your country of residence
* transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment

Check weather forecasts and conditions. Make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario with items such as a map, compass, GPS and telecommunications equipment.

Adventure sports and activities are riskier if you’re alone. Consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave details of your itinerary with someone.

### Skiing

See [preparing for winter sports abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes).

Take advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel. Follow local skiing laws and regulations.

Off-piste skiing is very dangerous and can invalidate your travel insurance. Avalanches are a risk in some areas. Follow safety instructions carefully and go with a qualified guide. See [European Avalanche Warning Service](https://www.avalanches.org/) and the [Austrian Avalanche Warning Service](http://www.lawine.at/) (in German).

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Austria, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad) and check the [rules of the road in the RAC’s Austria guide](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/austria/). The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.

Driving laws in Austria can be complex, especially for caravan and motorhomes. For more information, see [EU road rules and safety](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm) and [Austrian vehicle laws](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/freizeit_und_strassenverkehr/kfz/10.html).

You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Austria if you are aged 18 or over. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to [update it to a photocard licence](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence).

If you are visiting Austria, you may be able to use your [Blue Badge](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/blue-badge-using-it-in-the-eu/using-a-blue-badge-in-the-european-union) in some circumstances. Check local parking rules.

Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience and a higher minimum age.

You must carry insurance and vehicle ownership documents.

There is also [guidance on driving if you’re living in Austria](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria#driving-in-austria).

### Motorway tolls

All vehicles on motorways and expressways in Austria are subject to tolls. If you use Austrian motorways, you must [display a vignette (sticker)](https://www.austria.info/en/service-and-facts/getting-there-around/by-car/vignette) inside your windscreen. You could get a fine if you do not.
