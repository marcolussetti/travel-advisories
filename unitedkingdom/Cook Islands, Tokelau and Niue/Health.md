# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

If you are in Cook Islands or Niue call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

There are no hospitals or ambulance services in Tokelau.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/264/niue-cook-islands-tokelau#Vaccine_Recommendations) for the Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/264/niue-cook-islands-tokelau#Other_Risks), including dengue.

### Drinking water

Tokelau and Niue’s water supply is still at the household level. Rainwater harvesting from roofs is the primary source of water in Tokelau. Boiling water and only drinking bottled water is strongly recommended.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue

Medical facilities in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau are limited. In a medical emergency, evacuation to mainland New Zealand is likely the only option for treatment.

Hospitals may not be as well-equipped as those in UK and may lack specialist equipment, including neo-natal equipment for premature babies. You may have to pay before receiving any hospital treatment. Tokelau does not have a hospital. The authorities may not be able to respond to emergency situations.

Not all Pacific islands have diver decompression chambers, and the nearest chamber may not be working. Divers needing emergency treatment may need medical evacuation. Check locally for the nearest working decompression chamber.
