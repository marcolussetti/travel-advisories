# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Tunisian Embassy in the UK](https://consular.website/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Tunisia, your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Dual nationals

Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on the same passport.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Tunisia without a visa for up to 90 days. Contact the [Tunisian Embassy in the UK](https://consular.website/) for information on how to apply.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

Border officials will stamp your passport on arrival and check the length of your stay on departure. If you overstay the 90-day period without a valid reason, you will have to pay a fine. You can pay on departure at the airport, or in advance at some police stations.

### Checks at border control

On arrival in Tunisia, border officials have the right to ask for:

* your contact details
* your onward or return travel tickets
* proof of a hotel booking or other accommodation details

A small number of visitors have been denied entry to Tunisia, or been delayed, for not being able to provide sufficient evidence of accommodation.

### Additional processing at airports

Border officials check passenger names against an immigration database. A small number of passengers with the same or similar names to those on the database have been delayed and questioned on arrival and departure to confirm their identity. Occasionally border officials carry out searches on these passengers. Statistically, this has disproportionately affected British nationals of South Asian descent.

This can cause distress and inconvenience. The British Embassy in Tunis cannot override decisions made by the Tunisian authorities but if you are affected, contact the British Embassy on +216 71 108 700 or contact the Tunisian Embassy in London.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Tunisia guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/226/tunisia#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Tunisia](https://www.aeroportdetunis.com/en/customs_tunis_airport.php#:~:text=Customs%20rules%20at%20Tunis%20airport,you%20have%20anything%20to%20declare%20%3F&text=When%20you%20arrive%20in%20Tunisia,payment%20of%20duties%20and%20taxes.). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into and out of Tunisia

Tunisia has strict currency controls in place. If you are bringing in foreign currency, check the rules and [make any required declarations](https://www.aeroportdetunis.com/en/customs_tunis_airport.php#Currencies). If border officials find undeclared amounts over the limit, they may confiscate the excess amount.

You are not allowed to take Tunisian dinars out of the country. To exchange leftover dinars at the end of your stay into pounds, you need to show the receipt from the bank where you first withdrew or bought the dinars. Receipts from cash machines are not accepted.

### Drones

It is illegal to bring drones into Tunisia without authorisation. Any drones detected will be confiscated and stored until your departure.
