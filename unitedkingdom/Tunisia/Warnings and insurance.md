Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Western Tunisia, including the Tunisia-Algeria border

FCDO advises against all travel to:

* the Chaambi Mountains National Park
* the designated military operations zones:

  + Mount Salloum
  + Mount Sammamma
  + Mount Mghila

This is due to cross-border terrorist activity and operations by the Tunisian security forces.

In addition, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:

* areas north and west of the town of Ghardimaou in Jendouba Governorate, including El Feidja National Park
* within 20km of the Tunisia-Algeria border in El Kef and Jendouba governorates, south of the town of Jendouba
* Kasserine Governorate, including the town of Sbeitla
* within 10km of the rest of the Tunisia-Algeria border south of Kasserine Governorate
* within 10km of Mount Mghila
* Mount Orbata

### Southern Tunisia, including the Tunisia-Libya border

FCDO advises against all travel to:

* the militarised zone south of the towns of El Borma and Dhehiba
* within 20km of the rest of the Tunisia-Libya border area north of Dhehiba
* the town of Ben Guerdane and immediate surrounding area

This is due to cross-border terrorist activity and fighting in Libya.

In addition, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 75km of the Tunisia-Libya border, including Remada and El Borma but excluding Zarzis, the C118 road and all areas in Medenine Governorate north of the road.
