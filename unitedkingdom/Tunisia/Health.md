# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 190 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Tunisia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/226/tunisia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Tunisia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/226/tunisia), including biting insects and ticks.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

If you’re bringing prescription medicines, keep them in the original packaging and carry a note from your GP confirming the medication has been prescribed to you. If you have any specific concerns about taking certain types of medication with you to Tunisia, contact the [Tunisian Embassy in the UK](https://consular.website/).

## Healthcare in Tunisia

FCDO has a list of [list of medical providers in Tunisia](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tunisia-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak some English.

There’s no provision for free medical attention for foreign nationals in Tunisia. All doctors’ fees, medication and treatment in private clinics must be paid for on the spot (and sometimes before treatment). These costs can be high. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
