# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need;
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation.

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Call 911 for emergencies.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Panama](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/174/panama#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Panama](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/174/panama), including:

* dengue – on 30 July 2024 [the Panama Ministry of Health issued a health alert](https://www.minsa.gob.pa/noticia/ministerio-de-salud-declara-alerta-sanitaria-por-aumento-de-casos-de-dengue) (in Spanish) due to the increase in dengue cases, particularly in Panama City, Colón, Panama East and Panama West
