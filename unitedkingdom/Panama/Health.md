# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need;
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation.

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Call 911 for emergencies.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Panama](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/174/panama#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Panama](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/174/panama), including:

* dengue
* malaria
* Zika virus
* chikungunya
* HIV

Tap water is safe to drink in most of the country. Follow local recommendations in rural and island areas, where there can be a risk of contaminated water.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Panama. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Panama City has some good private hospitals and clinics, but medical facilities outside the capital are limited.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Panama](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/panama-list-of-lawyers/list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners-in-panama-city) where some staff will speak English.
