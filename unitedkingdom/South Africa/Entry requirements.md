# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in South Africa set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [South African High Commission in the UK](https://dirco.gov.za/uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 30 days after the date you leave South Africa and have at least 2 blank pages.

### Dual nationals

If you are a South African citizen aged 18 or over, you must use a South African passport to enter and exit South Africa. It is illegal to use another country’s passport. See the [South African Department of Home Affairs](https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/travel-documents) for further information.

## Visa requirements

You can visit South Africa without a visa for up to 90 days for business or tourism.

Check the expiry date of your visa or entry stamp and ensure you do not overstay.

For more information on visas, contact the [South African High Commission](https://dirco.gov.za/uk/).

The Department of Home Affairs also has information on [South Africa visas and immigration regulations](https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/applying-for-sa-visa).

## Travelling with children
