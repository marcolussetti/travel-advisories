# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance with an English speaker.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* the latest [vaccine recommendations for Armenia](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/12/armenia#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Armenia, including Mount Aragats (4,090m elevation) and the lakes of Aragats (approximately 3,000m). Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare facilities in Armenia

Public medical facilities and treatment in Yerevan are generally sufficient for minor or straightforward ailments. Public healthcare outside Yerevan is likely to be basic. Private hospitals in Armenia are of a good standard but can be expensive.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There is also [guidance on healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-armenia#healthcare-in-armenia) if you’re living in Armenia.
