# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Wallis and Futuna’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

Wallis and Futuna is a self-governing Overseas Collectivity of France (‘Collectivité d’Outre-Mer’). The authorities in Wallis and Futuna set and enforce the entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Consulate General in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you leave Wallis and Futuna.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).
