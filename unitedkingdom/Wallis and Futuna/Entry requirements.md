# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Wallis and Futuna’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

Wallis and Futuna is a self-governing Overseas Collectivity of France (‘Collectivité d’Outre-Mer’). The authorities in Wallis and Futuna set and enforce the entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Consulate General in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you leave Wallis and Futuna.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Wallis and Futuna without a visa for up to 90 days for business or tourism. To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, check the [visa application process and timelines](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/royaume-uni) on the French visa website.
