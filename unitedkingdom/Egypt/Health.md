# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 123 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Egypt](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/71/egypt#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Egypt](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/71/egypt#General_Information), including:

* dengue
* tick-borne diseases such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Egypt. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines may be controlled substances in Egypt. You may need permission from [Egypt’s Ministry of Health](http://www.mohp.gov.eg/) before you arrive. If you do not have prior permission or the required documentation, you will not be allowed to take the medication into Egypt and you may be prosecuted.

If you travel with prescription medication, carry a letter from your GP stating the:

* condition you’re being treated for
* amount of medication you will be carrying
* medication is for your personal use only

For further information, contact the [Egyptian Consulate General in the UK](https://egyptconsulate.co.uk/).

## Healthcare in Egypt

Some hotel doctors have overcharged for treatment and medicines. Pharmacies outside hotels will often supply medication at lower prices. FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Egypt](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/egypt-list-of-medical-facilities-practitioners) where some staff will speak English.

Access to specialised treatment for psychiatric illness is limited and may not be available outside major cities.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
