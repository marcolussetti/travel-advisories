## Conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs)

International borders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) could close at short notice, including the Taba border crossing between Israel and Egypt. Check with local authorities and read [Israel travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel) and [OPTs travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories) before trying to cross.

### Entering Egypt from Gaza

The Rafah border crossing is currently closed. When re-opened, Israel, Egypt and the authorities in Gaza may determine procedures for who is permitted to cross and when.

If you are a British national in Gaza who wants to leave Gaza, see [Israel travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel#travelling-to-egypt-from-gaza) and [OPTs travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories#travelling-to-egypt-from-gaza).

Humanitarian aid workers cannot enter or exit Gaza through Egypt at this time.

### Sending aid to Gaza from Egypt

The Egyptian authorities have said all aid to Gaza must go through the [Egyptian Red Crescent](https://egyptianrc.org/). Standard operating procedures can be found on the [Logistics Cluster](https://logcluster.org/en/document/palestine-egypt-standard-operating-procedures-egyptian-red-crescent-erc-january-2024) website. The authorities are unlikely to consider requests for humanitarian access made in Egypt at short notice.

### Concern for friends and family
