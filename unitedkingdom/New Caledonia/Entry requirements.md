# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of New Caledonia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

New Caledonia is an Overseas Territory of France (‘Territoire d’Outre-Mer’). The authorities in New Caledonia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [French Consulate General in the UK](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-in-London-).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you plan to leave New Caledonia and have at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit New Caledonia without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism or business. To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, [check the visa application process and timelines](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/royaume-uni) on the French visa website.

### UK residents of New Caledonia

Carry your residence document, as well as your passport, when entering or exiting New Caledonia. If you’ve applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email.

## Vaccine requirements

You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

## Customs rules
