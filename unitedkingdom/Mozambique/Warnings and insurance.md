## Disruption and ongoing protests

Significant unrest and protests continue across Mozambique following national elections in October 2024. Protests can be violent and occur at short notice, road toll gates are particularly vulnerable.

Access to land borders could be affected, along with public services and transport.

To reduce your personal risk:

* seek local advice and monitor the local media
* avoid large gatherings or demonstrations
* pay attention to your surroundings
* do not travel after dark

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
