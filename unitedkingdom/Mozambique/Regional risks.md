# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Mozambique. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDO’s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/mozambique/safety-and-security).

## Cabo Delgado Province

FCDO advises against all travel to the following districts of Cabo Delgado due to attacks by groups with links to Islamist extremism and clashes between insurgents, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces:

* Chiure
* Mueda
* Nangade
* Palma, except Palma town, where FCDO advises against all but essential travel
* Mocimboa da Praia
* Muidumbe
* Meluco
* Macomia
* Quissanga
* Ibo, including the islands off the coast

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the remainder of Cabo Delgado Province due to attacks by groups with links to Islamist extremism. Security forces have set up roadblocks throughout the province.

There are no direct flights between Palma town and Maputo and we advise against travelling there by road.

## Nampula Province

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the districts of Memba and Eráti in Nampula Province due to attacks by groups with links to Islamist extremism.

## Niassa Province

Groups with links to Islamist extremism have previously carried out attacks in the Mecula, Mavago and Marrupa districts of Niassa Province. Although there have been no recent reports of attacks, you should stay aware of your surroundings in these areas, as the situation may change without warning.
