# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Mozambique’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Mozambique set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Mozambican High Commission in the UK](https://www.mozambiquehighcommission.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Mozambique, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Make sure you get your passport stamped.

You need at least 2 blank pages for entry stamps.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to Mozambique](https://www.mozambiquehighcommission.org.uk/visa-section.html) for tourism or business for up to 30 days but the Mozambican authorities request you apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) at least 48 hours before departure. You can [apply through the Mozambique eVisa official portal](https://evisa.gov.mz/).

On arrival, you must be able to show border control a written invitation from your host, or a confirmed reservation for accommodation, and a return or onward air ticket.

Keep the receipt provided upon arrival at the border, as you may need to show it when exiting Mozambique.

## Entering Mozambique by land crossing

It can take a long time to clear border formalities at the Lebombo-Ressano Garcia land crossing from South Africa, especially during holiday periods. There can be delays if you are travelling on public transport. Allow time to get to your destination before nightfall.

There have been armed robberies close to the Lebombo border in Nelspruit. These often take place in the queue for the border, mainly after dark. When you stop at junctions or in queues, stay alert and ensure you have space to turn and drive off.

Land border crossings into neighbouring countries can be restricted, blocked or closed at short notice.

## Travel to or from South Africa

If you’re planning to enter South Africa before or after you visit Mozambique, or if you’re planning to travel through South Africa, check the [travel advice for South Africa](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/entry-requirements).

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
