# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Mozambique is currently experiencing a cholera outbreak in central and northern areas of the country. See [information on cholera](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/32/cholera).

## Emergency medical number

Call 848888 or 823388 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Recommended vaccines and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mozambique](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/155/mozambique#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Mozambique](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/155/mozambique) including:

* malaria
* dengue
* schistosomiasis
* mpox

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Mozambique

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Mozambique](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mozambique-list-of-medical-facilties/mozambique-list-of-medical-facilties) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Mozambique](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-mozambique#healthcare-in-mozambique).

Hospital facilities are of a lower standard compared to the UK, especially in the north of the country. In cases of serious illness or injury, medical evacuation to South Africa or the UK may be necessary.

Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
