# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 from a mobile or 18 from a landline and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Monaco](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/150/monaco#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Monaco](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/150/monaco).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Monaco

Monaco is not a member of the EU so reciprocal medical arrangements with the EU do not apply.

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) are not accepted in Monaco. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

## Travel and mental health
