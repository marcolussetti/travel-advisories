# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Albania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Albanian Embassy in the UK](https://ambasadat.gov.al/united-kingdom/en).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Albania.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Albania without a visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, for tourism or business.

If you want to stay longer than 90 days, you must [apply in advance for a long-stay visa](https://e-visa.al/apply) or [apply for a residence permit from within Albania](https://e-albania.al/eAlbaniaServices/UseService.aspx?service_code=15308).

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Albania, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Albania guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/2/albania#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules
