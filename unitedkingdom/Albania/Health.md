# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 127 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Albania](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/2/albania#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face Albania](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/2/albania).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Albania. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air pollution

There can be high levels of air pollution in Albania. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) website and check air quality levels on the [World Air Quality Index website](https://aqicn.org/map/europe/).

### Tap water and milk

Do not drink the tap water in Albania, as it may cause illness. Only drink bottled water. If you drink milk, make sure it is UHT (ultra high temperature) or pasteurised milk.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Albania

Medical and dental facilities, including accident and emergency facilities, are very poor, particularly outside Tirana. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [list of medical providers in Albania](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/albania-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
