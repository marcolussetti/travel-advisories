Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Former Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces

FCDO advises against all travel to the former Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, due to the presence of a rebel group in the Kibira National Park and possible armed incursions from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Former Kayanza Province

FCDO advises against all travel on the main RN6 and RN10 roads running west from Kayanza through the Kibira National Park towards former Cibitoke Province, due the presence of a rebel group and possible armed incursions from DRC.

### Melchior Ndadaye International Airport to Cibitoke

FCDO advises against all travel on the RN5 road north of Melchior Ndadaye International Airport in Bujumbura towards Cibitoke.

### Former Bujumbura Rural Province

FCDO advises against all travel to areas of the former Bujumbura Rural Province west of the Rusizi river towards the border with DRC, including Rusizi National Park (also known as Rusizi Delta Nature Reserve). This is due to possible armed incursions from DRC.

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Bujumbura Rural

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area of the former Bujumbura Rural Province, east of the Rusizi river. This is due to the proximity to conflict in eastern DRC.

### Bujumbura Mairie

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the former Bujumbura Mairie Province, including the city of Bujumbura. This is due to the proximity to conflict in eastern DRC.

## Burundi-DRC border

Armed group activity and conflict along the border between Burundi and DRC has increased. Be cautious and keep up to date with developments through local media, given heightened insecurity.

Armed group activity and the movement of military and refugees in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) could affect people on the Burundian side of the border, in the former Cibitoke, Bubanza, Bujumbura Mairie and Bujumbura Rural provinces. The security situation in DRC near to Burundi’s border is unstable (see [Democratic Republic of the Congo’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) for more information).

The only international airport in Burundi is the Melchior Ndadaye airport. In the event that flights were not available at the airport, there
are currently limited land border options to exit Burundi. The DRC border area is unstable and the Rwandan border is closed. The Tanzania-Burundi border continues to operate normally, although transport options may be limited by the ongoing fuel shortages.
