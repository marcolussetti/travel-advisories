Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces

FCDO advises against all travel to Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, due to the presence of a rebel group in the Kibira National Park and possible armed incursions from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Kayanza Province

FCDO advises against all travel on the main road running west from Kayanza through the Kibira National Park towards Cibitoke Province, due the presence of a rebel group and possible armed incursions from DRC.

### Melchior Ndadaye International Airport to Cibitoke

FCDO advises against all travel on the RN5 road north of Melchior Ndadaye International Airport in Bujumbura towards Cibitoke.

### Bujumbura Rural Province

FCDO advises against all travel to areas of Bujumbura Rural Province west of the Rusizi river towards the border with DRC, except for the Rusizi National Park. This is due to possible armed incursions from DRC.

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area of Bujumbura Rural above the Isale road.

## Burundi-DRC border

Risks associated with increased fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Burundian side of the border, in Cibitoke, Bubanza and Bujumbura Rural provinces. There are risks because of the closeness of the potential fighting, and the movement of military and refugees. The security situation in DRC near to Burundi’s border is unstable (see [Democratic Republic of the Congo’s travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) for more information). Keep up to date with developments through local media.

The only international airport in Burundi is the Melchior Ndadaye airport.  In the event that flights were not available at the airport, there are currently limited land border options to exit Burundi.  The DRC border area is unstable and the Rwandan border is closed.  The Tanzania-Burundi border continues to operate normally, although transport options may be limited by the ongoing fuel shortages.
