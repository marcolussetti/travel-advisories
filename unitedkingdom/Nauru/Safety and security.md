# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Nauru

Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Nauru, attacks cannot be ruled out.

## Laws and cultural differences

### Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Do not get involved with illegal drugs of any kind. There are severe penalties including custodial sentences for drug offences.

### LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal, but Nauru society is conservative and same-sex partners showing affection in public may cause offence. Read more [advice for LGBT+ travellers](https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice).

### Money

There is only one ATM on the island – at the Menen Hotel – and it is often out of cash. Credit cards are not accepted. Take enough Australian dollars in cash to cover your trip.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Nauru, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

Check licence requirements with your rental car firm.

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to [extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

### Tropical cyclones

During the rainy season from November to May, there’s a risk of strong winds, sea swells and tropical cyclones. Monitor regional and international weather updates from the [World Meteorological Organization](https://severeweather.wmo.int/) and the [Fiji Meteorological Service](http://www.met.gov.fj/) and check local newspapers and radio.

### Drought

Nauru suffers from periods of severe drought. The authorities may impose water restrictions during these periods.
