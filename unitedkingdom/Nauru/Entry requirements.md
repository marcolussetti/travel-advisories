# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Nauru’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Nauru set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Nauru’s Honorary Consul in the UK:
