# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Tanzania. It only covers regions where The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.

You should also read FCDO’s [overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/tanzania) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/tanzania/safety-and-security).

## Mtwara Province

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to any area within 20km of the Tanzanian border with the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.

The presence of groups linked to Islamic extremism in Cabo Delgado is creating cross-border tensions and instability. There is a risk of violent attacks. An attack on Kitaya village in October 2020 was claimed by groups linked to Islamic extremism operating from northern Mozambique.

## Tanzania-Burundi border and Kigoma region

There have been armed robberies in the area bordering Burundi and in Kigoma region, including vehicle hijackings. Drive only in hours of daylight. There are few facilities for visitors.

## National parks

Some parks are extremely remote, and emergency access and evacuation can be difficult. If you choose to camp, only use official sites. Make sure you are properly equipped and seek local advice when travelling to isolated areas.

There are risks associated with viewing wildlife, particularly on foot or at close range. Always follow park regulations and advice from wardens, and make sure you have the correct documentation or permit before entering a national park.
