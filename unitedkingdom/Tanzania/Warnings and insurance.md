Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Tanzania

### Tanzania

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to any area within 20km of the Tanzanian border with the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.

## Political situation and ongoing disruption

General elections took place on 29 October.

Protests and the resulting security response led to fatalities and injuries in many areas. Further demonstrations including violent responses by security forces are possible. Calls for protests on 9 December, Independence Day, have been widely shared on social media.

Be prepared for:

* security checkpoints in Dar es Salaam and other urban areas
* internet and mobile network outages
* curfews
* travel disruptions
* restrictions on availability of supplies, such as food, water and fuel, which may last several days.
* invasive checks on personal electronic devices

Stay away from all demonstrations, rallies and large crowds, monitor local media and follow the advice of the authorities.

The British High Commission has advised staff not to plan travel between 5-10 December, due to the risk of disruption.

The authorities have previously limited internet access during or after protests. Make a note of important phone numbers including your airline, travel operator, insurance company and the FCDO’s consular assistance number in case the internet is not accessible.

Consular assistance can be reached 24/7, on +255 22 229 0000 or +44 (0) 20 7008 5000.
