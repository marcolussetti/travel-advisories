## Political situation and ongoing disruption

General elections took place in Tanzania on 29 October.

Following violent protests and unrest in some parts of the country, there have been fatalities and injuries. Although the political situation is now calmer, further demonstrations including strong responses by security forces are possible. Curfews may remain in some parts of the country such as Mbeya and Mwanza. Incidents could occur any time and location, and may turn violent again.

British High Commission staff have been advised to limit unnecessary travel outside of Dar es Salaam.

Groups of tourists have been targeted and detained by local police for allegedly interfering with or inciting anti-government protests.

Local transport continues to see some disruption. Check with your travel provider for the latest information before travelling to airports or other transport hubs.

British nationals are advised to:

* monitor local media
* follow the advice of the local authorities
* stay away from all demonstrations, rallies, and large crowds

There is some disruption to mobile networks, the internet and social media.
