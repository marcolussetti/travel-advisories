Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Mtwara Region along the Tanzania-Mozambique border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the Tanzanian border with Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique.

This is due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.
