Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Mtwara Region along the Tanzania-Mozambique border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the Tanzanian border with Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique.

This is due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.

## General election

General elections took place in Tanzania on 29 October 2025.

Following protests and unrest in some parts of the country, the Tanzanian police announced a nationwide curfew effective from 6pm local time on 29 October. Travel to and from some international airports may be affected due to road closures. Some international flights have been diverted from landing in Tanzanian airports. You should contact your airline or travel provider for further information.

British nationals are advised to shelter in place, adhere to the curfew, monitor local media, follow the advice of the local authorities, and stay away from all demonstrations, rallies, and large crowds.

Past elections have also seen disruptions to mobile networks, the internet and social media.
