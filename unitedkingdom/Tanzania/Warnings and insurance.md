Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

### Mtwara Region along the Tanzania-Mozambique border

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to within 20km of the Tanzanian border with Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique.

This is due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.

## Protests and nationwide curfew

General elections took place in Tanzania on 29 October and have not yet concluded.

Following protests and unrest in some parts of the country, the Tanzanian police announced a nationwide curfew effective from 6pm local time on 29 October which remains in place. Protests are ongoing in parts of the country with some turning violent. There have been reports of live fire in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza and Mbeye.

The curfew is being enforced, with widespread road blockades and closures nationwide. Most international flights have been cancelled to and from Nyerere International Airport, Dar es Salaam.

Arusha International Airport and Kilimanjaro International Airport are closed. Some international and domestic flights to and from Zanzibar airport have been cancelled. There are no ferries running from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar. You should contact your airline or travel provider for further information before travelling to airports or other transport hubs.

British nationals are advised to shelter in place, adhere to the curfew, monitor local media, follow the advice of the local authorities, and stay away from all demonstrations, rallies, and large crowds.

There is significant disruption to mobile networks, the internet and social media.
