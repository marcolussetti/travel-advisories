Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Tanzania

### Tanzania

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to any area within 20km of the Tanzanian border with the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, due to attacks by groups linked with Islamic extremism.

## Political situation and ongoing disruption

General elections took place in Tanzania on 29 October.

Protests and the resulting security response led to fatalities and injuries in many areas. Although the political situation is now calmer, further demonstrations including violent responses by security forces are possible, particularly around national holidays. Incidents could occur at any time and location and may turn violent again.

British nationals are advised to:

* monitor local media
* follow the advice of the local authorities
* stay away from all demonstrations, rallies, and large crowds

There is some ongoing disruption to mobile networks, the internet and social media.
