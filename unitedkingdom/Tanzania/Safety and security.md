# Safety and security

This guide also has safety advice for [regions of Tanzania](/foreign-travel-advice/tanzania/regional-risks).

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Tanzania

Terrorist attacks in Tanzania cannot be ruled out.

Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

* places of worship
* transport hubs
* embassies
* hotels
* restaurants
* bars
* major gatherings like sporting or religious events
* crowded places

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Extremists linked to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab based in Somalia pose a threat across the East Africa region, and are thought to be active in Tanzania. Attacks by IS-Mozambique, who are based in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, are possible near Tanzania’s border with this area of Mozambique. There is also thought to be some support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). The Tanzanian authorities have successfully made a number of arrests in connection to terrorism. However, many incidents in Tanzania are of unclear origin and may be conducted by criminal gangs.

In 2020, the village of Kitaya in the Mtwara region was attacked, close to the border with Mozambique, the attack was claimed by Islamic extremists operating from northern Mozambique. Most attacks target the local security forces, although attacks against western interests are also possible.

## Political situation

Recent elections have seen demonstrations and political gatherings across mainland Tanzania and the islands of Zanzibar, which have turned violent and resulted in fatalities.

Stay away from all demonstrations, rallies, and large crowds.

If you become aware of any nearby disruption, leave the area immediately and monitor  social media and local media for up-to-date information.

The authorities have previously limited internet access during or after protests. Make a note of important phone numbers including your travel operator, insurance company and the FCDO’s consular assistance number in case the internet is not accessible.

### Social media

It is illegal to take or share photographs and video footage of protests and violence. Keep away from activities that could be considered political, including political discussions in public places or online. There is a risk you could be detained for social media activities including posting comments, blogging or sharing photographs or video footage relating to protests or the current political situation.

### Electronic Devices

Tanzanian security services may request to check your phone and other electronic devices for content related to the events around elections, and to review participation in online groups perceived to have incited violence. The police have said that it is an offence to hold or share videos or images that ‘cause panic or degrade a person’s dignity’.

## Crime

### Violent crime

There is a risk of armed crime, including armed robbery, throughout Tanzania. Take particular care in places frequented by tourists and foreign residents. In Dar es Salaam, tourists and residents have been targeted:

* in the city centre
* in the Masaki and Oysterbay peninsula area, particularly at Coco Beach
* along Toure Drive

In Zanzibar incidents have taken place in Stone Town and at hotels and on popular tourist beaches throughout the island.

Bag snatching is a well-known tactic of criminals, who may operate from cars or motorbikes. If you are walking on the street:

* walk towards the traffic so you can see vehicles approaching
* walk as far away from the road as possible
* carry bags loosely by the handle or hanging off your shoulder and do not secure the strap across your chest
* avoid walking or cycling at night or alone

Do not carry large amounts of cash or display valuables such as expensive jewellery or watches. Leave your passport in a safe place and carry a copy for ID checks.

When in a vehicle, keep car doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight. Be particularly careful at night when there is a higher incidence of crime. Do not stop if pedestrians or hitchhikers try to flag you down.

### Sexual Assault

Incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreigners have occurred, including at beach resorts.

You can take steps to reduce your risk:

* avoid walking alone at night
* do not leave drinks unattended
* be wary when dealing with strangers, and anyone offering rides or other invitations

If you’re a victim of a sexual assault or other crime, you can report it to the [British High Commission in Dar es Salaam](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-dar-es-salaam). Consular staff can help:

* report the incident with local authorities
* explain the process
* translate for you if there’s a language barrier

See FCDO’s guidance for [victims of rape and sexual assault in Tanzania](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tanzania-information-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault/tanzania-information-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault).

### Express kidnap

In Dar es Salaam, tourists have been ‘express kidnapped’. This means they’ve been assaulted, robbed and forced with the threat of violence to withdraw cash from ATMs. Some have been forced to arrange cash transfers of up to £5,000 through Western Union after being befriended by strangers or getting into unlicensed taxis.

### Protecting your property

Burglary is a risk. Make sure residential property is secure and lock all doors and windows, especially at night. If where you’re staying has a security guard, they should insist on official identification before allowing anyone to enter your property or compound. If in doubt, do not let strangers in and raise the alarm.

### Harassment

There have been cases where women travelling alone and in small groups have been verbally harassed.

## Laws and cultural differences

You should respect local laws and customs.

If you are arrested or detained for any reason, you can insist that the British High Commission is notified immediately.

### Religion

There is a high proportion of Muslims in Tanzania, particularly in Zanzibar and Pemba. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not cause offence, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.

### Personal ID

Always carry copies of your passport photo page and visa. Carry your work permit, if you have one. Immigration officials or police can request these documents at any time, so make sure you can get the originals quickly if you need them. If you’re a resident or longer term visitor, consider getting certified copies.

### Ramadan

Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. During this time, avoid eating or drinking in public, outside of hotels or restaurants. Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.

### Dress code

Dress modestly throughout Tanzania. Women wearing shorts or sleeveless tops away from tourist resorts in Zanzibar and Pemba, particularly in Stone Town, may cause offence to the local population.

Zanzibari authorities can fine you 700 US dollars or more if you’re wearing what they consider inappropriate clothing in public. For guides or tour operators, the fine can be at least 1,000 US dollars.

### Environmental laws

Plastic bags are banned for environmental reasons. If you arrive by air you’ll be asked to hand over all plastic bags on arrival. The ban does not include ‘ziplock’ bags for airline security procedures.

### Illegal drugs

Tanzania has strict laws on drug use. There may be severe penalties, including lengthy prison sentences which can be applied both for supplying and simple possession of any drugs, including when transiting through the airport.

Airports in Tanzania have technology and security for detecting illegal items, including cannabis. This can be used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.

Tanzanian prisons tend to be dirty and overcrowded.

### Discrimination and harassment

Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders suggest that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. If this happens, stay calm and ask that the [British High Commission](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-dar-es-salaam) is immediately informed.

### LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Tanzania, including Zanzibar. Same-sex relationships are not tolerated in Tanzania’s conservative society. If you show affection in public, like holding hands or kissing in public places, you could be arrested or put in prison.

Read more [advice for LGBT+ travellers](https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice).

### Money

US dollars are widely accepted in tourist areas. Travellers cheques are not widely accepted.

Most banks in major cities have ATMs that accept foreign debit cards and issue Tanzanian shillings. They sometimes break down or run out of money.

To minimise the risk of card cloning, use ATMs located within the bank. If you try to exchange non-Bank of England pound notes, you may get a reduced exchange rate.

## Outdoor activities and adventure tourism

### Game reserves and national parks

If you’re visiting game reserves and national parks, always follow park regulations and advice from wardens.

Only use reputable tour operators. Do not buy safari tours from touts. The Tanzanian Association of Tour Operators (TATO) [TATO – Tanzania Association of Tour Operators – Tour Operators Association of Tanzania (tatotz.org)](https://www.tatotz.org/) maintains a list of licensed tour companies.

### Trekking and climbing

If you are trekking or climbing, only use a reputable travel company, stick to established routes and always walk in groups. Make sure you are well prepared and equipped to cope with the terrain and low temperatures.

## Transport risks

### Air travel

The [UK Air Safety List (ASL)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list#tanzania) lists all airlines certified by the authorities with responsibility for regulatory oversight of Tanzania. These airlines are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the United Kingdom. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the [UK Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates).

### Road travel

If you’re planning to drive in Tanzania, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

The condition of cars rented out by some car hire companies is variable, so use a reputable firm. There are no roadside rescue or breakdown services. Road maps are hard to come by and not always up to date. Service stations are infrequent and may not have supplies of fuel. Consider using reputable taxis as an alternative.

You can drive in Tanzania with a UK driving licence for up to 6 months. For stays longer than this, an international driving permit (IDP) is required. Keep this with you in the car. To confirm the correct IDP to use, contact the [Tanzanian High Commission in the UK](https://www.uk.tzembassy.go.tz/).

To drive in Zanzibar, you’ll also need a local Zanzibar driving permit (which you can get through your hire car company). Carry several copies of your driving licence, permits and insurance documents.

### Driving standards and road conditions

Road users often drive dangerously, ignoring the rules of the road. Accidents resulting in death and serious injury are common.

Watch out for:

* vehicles and motorbikes trying to undertake or overtake using any lane, including on the hard shoulder
* drivers making manoeuvres without signalling
* poor attention to rules at roundabouts

Many roads need repair, including in major towns and cities. During the rainy season, flooding can cause landslides and road surfaces can deteriorate.

Roads in Tanzania’s national parks, mainly dirt tracks, can become hazardous or impassable after heavy rain. It may be essential to have a 4-wheel drive vehicle.

Avoid driving outside major towns and cities at night.

### Police checkpoints

There are frequent police checkpoints. If you’re stopped by the police, ask to see identification. If you are issued with a fine, the police should give you a government control number for payment. The police should not ask you to make any on the spot payments for traffic violations. If you’re involved in a road accident, co-operate with the local police.

If you see an unusual incident, or if somebody in plain clothes tries to flag you down, it is often safer not to stop.

### Buses and taxis

Local buses (‘dala dalas’), motorbike taxis (‘boda bodas’), and tuk-tuks (known locally as ‘bijajis’) can have poor safety standards. They are often poorly maintained and badly driven. They rarely have proper insurance cover. There are frequent accidents, some of which result in fatalities.

Do not accept lifts from strangers or anyone offering to find a taxi for you. It is safest to arrange a taxi through a hotel or travel operator. Always ask to see the driver’s ID and use reputable taxi services.

Pickpockets and bag-snatchers operate on overcrowded buses and at bus stations.

### Rail travel

There have been several accidents on Tanzanian railways. Seek local advice for any long-distance train travel.

### Lake and sea travel

In the last few years there have been several ferry disasters. Hundreds of people have died when travelling:

* between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar
* between the islands of Zanzibar
* in the Lake Zone area

If you think a ferry is overloaded or not seaworthy, do not get on. If you do board, familiarise yourself with emergency procedures on board and make a note of where the life jackets and emergency exits are located.

You should also beware of aggressive ticket touts at Tanzanian ports.

Continual pirate attacks on vessels sailing off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden show that the threat of piracy remains significant. The threat assessment of the combined international naval counter-piracy forces is that all sailing yachts under their own passage should avoid the [designated high-risk area](https://on-shore.mschoa.org/) or accept the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see [Piracy and armed robbery at sea](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety).

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to [extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

### Rainy seasons

The length of rainy seasons can vary, but they generally run from:

* the end of March to May
* October to mid-December

Heavy rainfall and strong winds can affect travel. Flooding and landslides can occur during heavy rain. If travelling to affected regions, you should take extra care and follow any advice given by the local authorities.

Monitor local and international weather reports and the [TMA website](https://www.meteo.go.tz/) for the latest updates. If travelling, plan your journeys carefully and make sure to follow local guidance.

Avoid walking, swimming, or driving through floodwater.

### Earthquakes

Earthquakes and tremors are a risk in Tanzania. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about [what to do before, during and after an earthquake](https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes).

The last significant earthquake (magnitude 6.0) happened on 12 August 2020, 66km north-east of Mafia Island.
