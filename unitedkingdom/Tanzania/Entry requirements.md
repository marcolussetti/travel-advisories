# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Tanzania’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Tanzania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Tanzania High Commission in the UK](https://uk.tzembassy.go.tz/contacts).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Tanzania, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least one blank page.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid British passport or [proof of right of abode](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode). See [Dual Citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania.

If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will also need a work permit. Information on how to apply is [available from the Tanzanian Prime Minister’s Office](https://epermit.kazi.go.tz/web/main/guidelines).

Your employer or volunteer organisation should help you arrange this before you travel.

If you overstay your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported.

The Tanzanian Immigration Department has [more information on visas](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/guidelines).

### Applying for a visa

[Apply for an ‘e-visa’](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before you travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.

You can also get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at the [main ports of entry to Tanzania](https://immigration.go.tz/index.php/entry-and-exit-point), subject to meeting all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival.

### Checks at border control

You must be ready to show your return or onward ticket at border control.

### Mpox screening

You will need to pass through mpox screening, in the form of body temperature checks, at all points of entry into Tanzania.

### Entering Zanzibar

All visitors to Zanzibar (excluding residents) must have mandatory Inbound Travel Insurance from the Zanzibar Insurance Corporation (ZIC) for the duration of their stay (up to 92 days).

You can only buy this insurance from ZIC. Other international travel insurance policies will not be accepted. Go to the [Visit Zanzibar](https://visitzanzibar.go.tz/) website for more information.

You may be refused entry if you do not have the correct insurance.

If you have any questions that are not covered on the website, contact ZIC by emailing inbound@zic.co.tz.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Tanzania, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Tanzania guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/220/tanzania#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Tanzania. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking wildlife products into and out of Tanzania

Do not bring animal skin accessories into Tanzania as you risk questioning or detention when leaving the country.

Border officials have arrested foreigners for trying to take wildlife items, including horns and seashells, out of the country. It’s illegal to do this without a certified export permit from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. If you’re caught you could be detained or fined.
