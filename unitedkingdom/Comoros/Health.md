# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call hospitals and ask for an ambulance.

* Grande Comore, hopital El Maarouf: +269 773 26 04
* Mohéli, hopital de Fomboni: +269 772 03 73
* Anjouan, hopital de Hombo: +269 771 00 34

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
