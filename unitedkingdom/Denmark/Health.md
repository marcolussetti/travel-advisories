# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest vaccinations recommendations for [Denmark](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/64/denmark#Vaccine_Recommendations), [Greenland](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/92/greenland#Vaccine_Recommendations) and [the Faroe Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/78/denmark-faroe-islands#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what other health risks you’ll face in [Denmark](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/64/denmark), [Greenland](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/92/greenland) and [Faroe Islands](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/78/denmark-faroe-islands).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Greenland. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Denmark does not recognise UK prescriptions. If you need medication, you should speak to a local pharmacist (‘Apotek’), who will be able to tell you if you need a prescription from a local GP.

## Healthcare in Denmark

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Denmark](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards in Denmark

To get medically necessary state healthcare in Denmark, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
* what treatment counts as medically necessary

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:

* changes to travel and accommodation bookings
* additional standard costs for treatment
* medical repatriation to the UK
* treatment that is ruled non-urgent
* private healthcare
* private clinics

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Denmark](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-denmark).

### Health insurance cards in Greenland

You will not be refused treatment, but an EHIC or GHIC will not cover the costs unless you are resident of a Nordic country, under the reciprocal agreement, or a resident of Denmark. You can find more details about [medical assistance available during a temporary stay in Greenland](https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/medical-assistance-during-temporary-stay-greenland).

You may also have to cover the cost of medical evacuation.

### Health insurance cards in Faroe Islands

You cannot use a GHIC or EHIC in the Faroe Islands. The UK has reciprocal agreements with the Faroe Islands, so British nationals can get the same medical treatment they would with a GHIC or EHIC. This arrangement is not a substitute for travel insurance.

If you travel to the Faroe Islands, you should still take your GHIC or EHIC with you. You’ll need to provide proof of identity and nationality, such as your UK passport.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
