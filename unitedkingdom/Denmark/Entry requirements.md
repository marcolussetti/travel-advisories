# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Denmark set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Danish Embassy in the UK](https://storbritannien.um.dk/en/about-us).

## Passport validity requirements

Denmark follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area (the expiry date does not need to be within 10 years of the date of issue)

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes Denmark, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in Denmark](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-denmark-for-work) are different.

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

At Danish border control, you may also need to:

* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

To stay longer, you must [meet the Danish government’s entry requirements](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply).

If you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

Read about [passport stamping if you live in Denmark](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-denmark#passports-and-travel).

### ID for travel from Denmark to Sweden

If you are travelling from Denmark to Sweden, see [information on border control requirements](https://www.oresunddirekt.se/en/find-a-job-in-denmark/commute-from-sweden-to-denmark/border-control-when-entering-sweden).

### Visas for Greenland and the Faroe Islands

Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not members of the EU. You do not need a visa to enter for tourism. If you plan to live and work there, you must get a work and residence permit – [apply for residence in Greenland or the Faroe Islands](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/The-Faroe-Islands-and-Greenland).

## New Schengen entry requirements

From 12 October 2025, the European Union’s (EU) new Entry/Exit System (EES) will begin. When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to:

* have you fingerprints and your photo taken
* answer the Schengen Border Code questions

If you enter the Schengen area through the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel at Folkestone or St Pancras International, this information will be taken at the border, before you leave the UK. You may also need to provide either your fingerprint or photo when you leave the Schengen area.

EES may take each passenger a few extra minutes to complete so be prepared to wait longer than usual at the border once the system starts.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Denmark](https://toldst.dk/en-us/individuals/special-rules-for-special-items). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

It is illegal to import whale products from Greenland or the Faroe Islands into the UK or EU. You could be fined up to £5,000 or given a prison sentence.

### Taking food into Denmark

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Taking money into Denmark

Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is [10,000 euros or more](https://toldst.dk/en-us/individuals/travel/if-you-are-travelling-with-large-amounts-of-valuables). You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
