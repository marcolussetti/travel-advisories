Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

### South Ossetia and Abkhazia

For security reasons, FCDO advises against all travel to the breakaway regions of:

* South Ossetia
* Abkhazia

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to areas immediately next to the administrative boundary lines with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

FCDO cannot provide face-to-face support to British nationals travelling in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as UK government employees are restricted from travelling there.
