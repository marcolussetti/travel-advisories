# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Yemen’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Yemen set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Yemeni Embassy in the UK](https://www.yemenembassy.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Yemen, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).
