Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Syria

FCDO advises against all travel to Syria due to the  the ongoing conflict and unpredictable security conditions and threat of terrorist attacks.

## UK government support

Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria. The FCDO may become aware of support provided by other organisations which can be shared with British nationals. If you need help, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency. Have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.
