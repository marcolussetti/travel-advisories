# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Syria

Emergency services may be limited in Syria due to the 14-year conflict that country has gone through.

### Help abroad in an emergency

Consular support is not available from the British government from within Syria. The FCDO may become aware of support provided by other organisations which can be shared with British nationals. If you need help, call the FCDO in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
