# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Dominica](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/66/dominica#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Dominica](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/66/dominica), including:

* Zika virus
* dengue
* chikungunya

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Dominica

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Dominica](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dominica-list-of-medical-facilities-practitioners).

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Dominica](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-dominica).

The Dominica China Friendship Hospital, the government hospital in Roseau, can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may require emergency evacuation.

Before choosing to be treated at a private facility, you should check the payment policy. Private clinics may ask for payment up front, so insurance documents may not be sufficient.

Private medical treatment in Dominica can be expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
