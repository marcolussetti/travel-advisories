# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Dominica’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Dominica set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Dominica High Commission in the UK](https://www.dominicahighcommission.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Dominica, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You do not need a visa to visit Dominica. The border authorities will grant you a stay of 6 months on arrival. If you want to stay longer, you must arrange and pay for an extension with the [Dominica Immigration Division](https://nationalsecurity.gov.dm/divisions/immigration-division).

It is illegal to overstay or work without a work permit.

### Checks at border control

At border control, you may also need to show a return or onward ticket.

## Departure tax

There is a departure tax of 86 East Caribbean dollars or 33 US dollars. It is usually included in the cost of your plane ticket. You also need to pay departure tax if travelling by ferry.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Dominica, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Dominica guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/66/dominica).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Dominica](https://customs.gov.dm/index.php/trade/prohibited-and-restricted-items). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into Dominica

Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 East Caribbean dollars or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you.
