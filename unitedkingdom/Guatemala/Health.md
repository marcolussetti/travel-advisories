# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 122 or 123 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Guatamala](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/96/guatemala#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Guatamala](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/96/guatemala).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Guatemala. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

You cannot use British-issued prescriptions in Guatemala. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’) look for one of the big national chains such as Meykos, Cruz Verde or Carolina y H.
