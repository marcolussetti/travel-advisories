## State of Prevention

Guatemalan authorities have announced that the ‘State of Siege’ ended on 16 February 2026. A ‘State of Prevention’ will be in place from 17 February 2026 for 15 days. Under this measure, the Government may deploy military support to certain services, disperse protests, restrict public or private gatherings, and impose limits on freedom of movement in specific circumstances. Follow the guidance of local authorities, remain alert to news reports, and limit late night travel where possible.
