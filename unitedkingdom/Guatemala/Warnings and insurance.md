Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:

* within 5km of the Mexican border from the Pacific Coast up to and including the Gracias a Dios crossing
* to the towns of Santa Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista and La Democracia in the department of Huehuetenango

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel to these areas](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/regional-risks).

## State of Siege

The Guatemalan government has declared a 30‑day nationwide state of siege (estado de sitio) effective 18 January 2025, in response to escalating insecurity linked to organised crime and gang activity, including recent attacks on law enforcement and prison riots.

British Nationals should exercise heightened caution. Under the measure, authorities may militarise certain areas, restrict civil liberties such as freedom of movement and assembly, and carry out arrests or home searches without warrants. Some public services may also be disrupted. Please follow guidance of local authorities.

## State of Exception

The Guatemalan government declared a State of Emergency in the municipalities of Santa Catarina Ixtahuacán and Nahualá in Sololá department in western Guatemala. This follows violent clashes involving armed security forces linked to territorial disputes. If you plan to visit Lake Atitlán, Quetzaltenango, or nearby towns, check your route in advance, monitor local news, and avoid traveling at night.

Under the State of Emergency, public gatherings are prohibited, road blocks are in force and security forces may intervene to disperse unauthorised gatherings. Restrictions also apply to carrying items that could be used for violence.
