# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Uzbekistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Uzbekistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Uzbekistan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air quality

Air quality in the Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions has deteriorated because of regular storms over the Aral Sea bringing salt, dust and pollutants into the air. Try to minimise your exposure to outside air by staying in an air-conditioned indoor place as much as possible, with windows and doors closed and well sealed.

Wash all fruit, vegetables and other foods, which might have been exposed. Regularly damp-dust all indoor surfaces, washing your hands afterwards. Monitor local reports and weather forecasts for the latest information and advice.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. See [Customs rules](/foreign-travel-advice/uzbekistan/entry-requirements#customs-rules).

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Uzbekistan

The quality of medical care in Uzbekistan is generally poor. Most hospitals are badly equipped and unhygienic, with a limited supply of drugs. There is no guarantee that equipment will have been properly sterilised, especially in rural hospitals. You should avoid all but basic or essential treatment in the event of an emergency. Medical insurance companies usually refer complaints of a more serious nature to hospitals in Europe or New Delhi.

There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Uzbekistan.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Uzbekistan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uzbekistan-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/uzbekistan-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
