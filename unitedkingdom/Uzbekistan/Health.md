# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Uzbekistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Uzbekistan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Uzbekistan. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air quality

Poor outdoor air quality is a risk in Uzbekistan, especially during winter between November and February. The major cities, including Tashkent and the Fergana valley, are most affected by these high seasonal levels of pollution.

The air quality in Karakalkpakstan and Khorezm regions can be poor all year round, because of regular storms over the Aral Sea bringing salt, dust and pollutants into the air.

Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected.

Read about the risks from [poor air quality, and steps you should take, on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/219/outdoor-air-quality).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. See [Customs rules](/foreign-travel-advice/uzbekistan/entry-requirements#customs-rules).

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Uzbekistan

The quality of medical care in Uzbekistan is generally poor. Most hospitals are badly equipped and unhygienic, with a limited supply of drugs. There is no guarantee that equipment will have been properly sterilised, especially in rural hospitals. You should avoid all but basic or essential treatment in the event of an emergency. Medical insurance companies usually refer complaints of a more serious nature to hospitals in Europe or New Delhi.

There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and Uzbekistan.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Uzbekistan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uzbekistan-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/uzbekistan-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
