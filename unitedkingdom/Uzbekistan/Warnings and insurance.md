Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Before you travel

No travel can be guaranteed safe. Read all the advice in this guide as well as [support for British nationals abroad](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad) which includes:

* advice on preparing for travel abroad and reducing risks
