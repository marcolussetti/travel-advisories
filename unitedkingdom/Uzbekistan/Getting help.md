# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Uzbekistan

Ambulance: 103

Fire: 101

Police: 102

A new unified emergency services number, 112, was introduced in 2024 to cover all emergency calls. The previous emergency numbers are still in operation.

Uzbekistan also has a 24/7 tourist hotline, the “Call Centre for Safe Tourism”, on 1173, whose operators speak English as well as Uzbek and Russian, and can direct callers to locally available support.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
