# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Kuwait](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/122/kuwait#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Kuwait

There is a state medical service with local clinics and several good hospitals. There are also private medical and dental facilities.

Private medical fees are high. The Kuwaiti government controls fees and has increased them for foreign residents and visitors. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

If you work in Kuwait, check whether your employer provides appropriate private medical insurance which includes repatriation. If not, you’re strongly advised to take out personal medical insurance for yourself and any dependants.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Kuwait](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kuwait-list-of-medical-facilities-and-repatriation-companies) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Kuwait](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-kuwait#healthcare).
