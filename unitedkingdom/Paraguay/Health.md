# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 141 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccinations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip check:

* the latest information on [vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Paraguay guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/176/paraguay)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Paraguay](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/176/paraguay#Other_Risks), including:

* dengue
* chikungunya
* poor air quality

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

If you need a regular prescription, you should bring enough medication with you.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

The NHS has information on [whether you can take your medicine abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/medicines/can-i-take-my-medicine-abroad/).

## Healthcare in Paraguay

There are some good private medical facilities, but only in the major cities. Hospitals and GPs will expect immediate payment for medical services. Some types of medicines may not be available.

Elsewhere, facilities may not meet UK standards. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Paraguay](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-paraguay) where some staff will speak English.
