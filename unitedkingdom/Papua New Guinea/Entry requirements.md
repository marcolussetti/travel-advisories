# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Papua New Guinea’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Papua New Guinea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Papua New Guinean High Commission in the UK](https://www.pnghighcomm.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Papua New Guinea, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Papua New Guinea. Visas can be obtained in advance online or at a Papua New Guinea (PNG) Embassy or High Commission. Tourist/visitor visas can also be obtained on arrival at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby.
