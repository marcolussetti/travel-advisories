Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel

FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:

* Hela and Southern Highlands Provinces due to the high risk of tribal fighting
* Enga Province in the Highlands, except Wabag District

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel](/foreign-travel-advice/papua-new-guinea/regional-risks).

## Enga Province

Following wide-spread intercommunal violence in Wapenamanda area of Enga Province, the provincial government has declared all districts except Wabag District, which remains relatively safe, as ‘fighting zones’.  The authorities report deaths, destruction of property, and the closure of public services.  Checkpoints, random searches, and curfews have been introduced.
