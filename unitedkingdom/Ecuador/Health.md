# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

You can get emergency assistance and register medical issues using the [ECU 911 smartphone application](https://www.ecu911.gob.ec/app-ecu-911/).

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Ecuador](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/70/ecuador#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Ecuador](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/70/ecuador), including Oropouche virus.

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Ecuador. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Ultraviolet radiation is a risk in Ecuador. Read more about [sun protection on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/23/sun-protection).

### Drinking water

To avoid getting sick, drink boiled, filtered or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Pharmacies in Ecuador may accept some UK prescriptions. They will accept antimicrobial prescriptions up to 3 days old and narcotic or psychotropic prescriptions up to 5 days old.

## Healthcare in Ecuador

The Ecuadorean public healthcare system provides the same level of care to locals and foreigners at no cost. However, a high standard of healthcare and specialised medical treatment may not always be available outside main cities. Private treatment can be very expensive, and private hospitals require a credit card guarantee for admission.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in Ecuador](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals--2) where some staff will speak English.

See [hospitalisation information pack](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-hospitalisation-information-pack) for further details on healthcare in Ecuador, including a [list of hospitals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals).

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Ecuador](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-ecuador).

### Healthcare in the Galapagos Islands

There are limited medical facilities in the Galapagos Islands. Make sure your insurance includes evacuation by air ambulance. If you travel to the Galapagos Islands by boat, you may be asked to supply information such as your blood group and emergency contacts when you board.

San Cristóbal Island has a well-equipped public hospital. Santa Cruz Island has a basic hospital. Isabela Island has a very small and extremely basic health centre.
