There are also tourism police units in the cities of Guayaquil, Cuenca, Santa Elena and Galapagos provinces. Read more [information on the tourism police from their website](https://www.policia.gob.ec/policia-turismo/).

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
