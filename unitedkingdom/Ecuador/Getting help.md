# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Ecuador

Telephone: 911 (ambulance, fire, police)

### Tourism police

Quito has a tourism police unit with branches in the north, old town, airport and at bus terminals. There are also tourism police units in the cities of Guayaquil, Cuenca, Santa Elena and Galapagos provinces. Read more [information on the tourism police from their website](https://www.policia.gob.ec/policia-turismo/).

### Reporting robbery and theft online

You can [report robbery and theft online in English](https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncias-en-linea-para-turistas/) to the Ecuador Attorney General’s Office (‘Fiscalía General’).

## Complaining about tourism services

To complain about tourism services, email the Ministry of Tourism: [denuncias@turismo.gob.eca](mailto:denuncias@turismo.gob.ec).

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
