## Heavy rainfall

Heavy rainfall in Ecuador’s highlands (Sierra) and Amazon regions has triggered flooding, landslides and significant damage to the national road network, especially in the provinces of Azuay, Napo, Sucumbíos, Zamora Chinchipe, Loja, and Chimborazo.

In several areas, landslides have disrupted vehicle access, making travel to the Amazon region difficult. The provinces of Napo and Zamora Chinchipe are among the most affected by the heavy rains, and on 4 July the government declared a road emergency there for 60 and 45 days respectively. Check the ECU911 updates on [road conditions and closures](https://www.ecu911.gob.ec/consulta-de-vias/) (in Spanish only).
