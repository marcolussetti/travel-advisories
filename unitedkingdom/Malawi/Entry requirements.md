# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Malawi’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Malawi set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Malawi High Commission in the UK](https://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive in Malawi.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

If you are travelling to Malawi for a visit of 30 days or less on a British passport you do not need a visa.

If you wish to live, work or study in Malawi, visit the [Malawi Immigration website](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/) for further information.

## Travelling with children from South Africa

If you’re travelling with children aged 17 and under and passing through South Africa, see what documents you need in [South Africa travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africa/entry-requirements).

## Vaccine requirements

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio vaccine, in some circumstances

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Malawi guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/136/malawi#Vaccine_Recommendations).
