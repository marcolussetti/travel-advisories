# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Malawi’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Malawi set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Malawi High Commission in the UK](https://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive in Malawi.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must apply for a visa to enter Malawi.

### Applying for a visa

Single or multiple entry visas can be obtained on arrival. You are advised to bring US dollars in cash for payment:

* 50 US dollars for a single-entry visa
* 150 US dollars for a 6-month multiple entry visa, and
* 250 US dollars for a one-year multiple entry visa

On-line e-visas are available on the [Malawi Immigration website](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/), although the system is not always up to date.

If you wish to live, work or study in Malawi, visit the [Malawi Immigration website](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/) for further information.
