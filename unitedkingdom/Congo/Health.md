# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

There’s no central number for emergency services. Check for local medical facilities and carry contact details with you.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before you travel:

* check the latest [vaccine recommndations for the Republic of Congo](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/55/congo#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the Republic of Congo](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/55/congo#Vaccine_Recommendations) , including:

* yellow fever
* schistosomiasis
* malaria and dengue
* mpox

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

If you take medication, bring enough for your time in the Republic of Congo and make sure it is clearly labelled. Bring a copy of any prescription.

## Healthcare in the Republic of Congo

Medical facilities in the country are limited, particularly in rural areas. Medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for all but the most basic treatments. If you become ill while in the Republic of Congo or straight after leaving the country, get immediate medical advice.

Make sure you have adequate travel and medical insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation; this should specifically include the very high costs of evacuation by air ambulance.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in the Republic of Congo](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners-in-the-republic-of-congo) where some staff will speak English.
