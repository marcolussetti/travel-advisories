# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of the Republic of Congo. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/congo) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/congo/safety-and-security).

## Republic of Congo-Central African Republic border area in Likouala Region

FCDO advises against all travel within 50km of the Republic of Congo-Central African Republic (CAR) border in Likouala Region.

There is a risk of violence, crime and insecurity in this area due to instability in CAR.

## The Pool Region

Some areas in the Pool region have historically been areas of conflict between the government and the Ninja insurgent group. There have not been any reports of live conflict since a ceasefire was agreed in 2017, however a risk remains of violent clashes breaking out with little or no notice, particularly in the districts of Boko, Kindamba, Kinkala, Mayama and Mindouli.
