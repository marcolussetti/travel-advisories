# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Gibraltar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency](http://www.gibraltarborder.gi/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Gibraltar, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

British nationals do not need a visa to enter Gibraltar for visits, study or work.

Gibraltar is not part of the [Schengen area](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). For information on visas and entry, see the [Gibraltar Borders and Coastguard Agency](http://www.gibraltarborder.gi/).

## Travel between Gibraltar and Spain

The Gibraltar-Spain border is a busy external Schengen border and Gibraltar is outside the Customs Union.

Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. The [Borders and Coastguard Agency](http://www.gibraltarborder.gi/frontier) has a [live camera feed](https://frontierqueue.gi/) of the queue at the Gibraltar Frontier. It also has up-to-date information on flights arriving and departing at Gibraltar International Airport.

If you are crossing the land border from Gibraltar into Spain, read [Spain travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain/entry-requirements#visa-requirements) for the latest entry requirements, particularly the evidence you may need to show at border control. Some travellers have not been able to provide the full documentation asked of them and have had their travel plans disrupted.

For all visitors to Spain there are rules on passport validity and special restrictions on what you can and cannot take into Spain, notably meat and milk products.

There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Do not hand over money to anybody claiming there is a charge.

## Travelling with children

If you’re travelling with children aged 17 or under who are not your own, you may have to show signed letters of parental consent when crossing from Gibraltar into Spain. This also applies to children travelling alone, or children travelling with adults other than their legal guardian (for example, teachers and students on school trips).

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Gibraltar guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/90/gibraltar#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods that can be brought into and taken out of Gibraltar](https://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/public-services/hm-customs). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

If you return to Gibraltar within one calendar month, you may only use your duty-free allowance on your first visit that month.

See more information on personal allowances for visitors to Gibraltar on [HM Government of Gibraltar’s website](https://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/legislations/integrated-tariff-regulations-2017-2817).

Gibraltar is not part of the EU Customs Union. If you travel from Gibraltar to Spain, declare any duty-free goods to Spanish customs officers.

If you are returning directly to the UK from Gibraltar, see [information on bringing goods into the UK](https://www.gov.uk/bringing-goods-into-uk-personal-use).
