## Presidential and parliamentary elections

Seychelles will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 25-27 September 2025. Elections in Seychelles are generally peaceful. However, political tensions can rise during the campaign period. Stay away from political rallies and related activities. While these events are usually peaceful, minor clashes between supporters have occurred in the past. Large political gatherings can also disrupt local services and traffic.
