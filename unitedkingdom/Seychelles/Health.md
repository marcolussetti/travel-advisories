# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Seychelles](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/194/seychelles#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Seychelles](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/194/seychelles).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Seychelles

As a tourist, you must pay for medical treatment.

Residents in Seychelles from overseas need to pay for some treatment, including medication and prescriptions.

The main hospital is at Mont Fleuri in Victoria on Mahé, and there are local health centres in most residential areas. Victoria Hospital has an accident and emergency department, and facilities such as scans. There are many private clinics in Seychelles, mostly offering GP services.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Seychelles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/seychelles-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.
