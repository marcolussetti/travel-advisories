# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bermuda’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Bermuda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Government of Bermuda London Office](https://bdalondonoffice.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Bermuda, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay and have space for entry and exit stamps.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Bermuda without a visa for up to 180 days in any 12-month period. You must have a ticket for return or onward travel.
