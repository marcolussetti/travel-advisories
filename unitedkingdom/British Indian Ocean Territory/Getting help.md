# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

British Indian Ocean Territory is a British Overseas Territory, so there is no British Embassy. [The British Indian Ocean Territory administration](https://www.biot.gov.io/) based in London provides assistance for British nationals.

## Emergency services in British Indian Ocean Territory

If you are in a life-threatening situation, declare it as a maritime emergency. Authorities will consider all reasonable assistance. You can contact:

* British Indian Ocean Territory authorities in Diego Garcia by radio on 2.182MHz HF SSB or VHF
* British Indian Ocean Territory police station on +246 370 29 38

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
