Latest update:
:   Updated information on the risks of being involved with illegal drugs, including cannabis. This includes risk of arrest if you are found carrying drugs when transiting through the airport ('Safety and security' page).

This travel advice covers the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). For mainland China, see [travel advice for China](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china) and for Macao SAR, see [Macao travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/macao).

## Dual Chinese-British nationality

Hong Kong does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality, the local authorities may treat you as a Chinese citizen, even if you enter Hong Kong on a full “British citizen” passport or hold a British National (Overseas) passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular help.

If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, carry evidence that you have done so.

See guidance on [nationality in China](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china).
