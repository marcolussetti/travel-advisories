On the night of 6 May, the Indian Ministry of Defence stated it had struck nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. There are reports of fatalities and casualties. There are reports of artillery fire across the Line of Control. There are reports on 8 May of drone activity in the border states of Jammu and Kashmir (including in the city of Jammu), Rajasthan, Punjab, and Gujarat.
