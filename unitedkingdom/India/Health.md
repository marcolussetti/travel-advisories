# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for India](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/105/india#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in India](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/105/india), including:

* dengue and malaria
* Zika
* chikungunya
* poor air quality

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts India. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

### Air pollution

Severe air pollution is a major health hazard, especially during the winter months from October to February. North Indian cities are most affected by extremely high levels of pollution. Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be especially affected. If you’re pregnant or have a respiratory or heart condition you may wish to consult a medical practitioner before you travel.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Pharmacies are widely available  in India. Most medicines that require a prescription in the UK will require one in India. Take your existing medicine packaging to show them exactly what you need.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in India

Medical facilities differ from those in the UK, especially in more remote areas. Specialised treatment may not be available outside major cities. In major cities, government and more expensive private medical care is available.

FCDO has a list of [medical providers in India](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/india-list-of-hospitals) where some staff will speak English.

### Transplant surgery

If you’re travelling to India for organ transplant surgery, check in advance with the hospital what proof they need about your circumstances in the UK. You may need to submit evidence of your marriage and birth of your children before the operation can take place. You can get copies of marriage and birth certificates from the [General Register Office in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/general-register-office). You may want to [get your documents legalised](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised) before travelling. The British High Commission cannot provide guarantees and certificates on your behalf.

If you are considering travelling to India for medical treatment:

* read more advice on [going abroad for medical treatment and elective surgery](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/in-hospital-abroad)
* discuss plans with your UK doctor before going ahead with any medical procedures abroad
* do your own research – private companies have a financial interest in arranging your medical treatment abroad and the information they provide should not be your only source of information
