# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of India’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in India set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [High Commission of India in London](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/) or [another Indian consulate](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/consular-jurisdiction/) in the UK.

## Passport validity requirements

To enter India, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport if you need to](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew).

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Returning to the UK

When returning to the UK, [British citizens](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship) must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit India unless you are an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholder.

India has a number of visa categories. Make sure you get the right visa for your travel.

You could be refused entry or deported for having the wrong visa. You could also be banned from entering India in the future.

For the latest information on Indian visas and immigration requirements, see the [Indian Bureau of Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/1f620c28-6ba1-4f25-ae77-2e8b63b02b61).

### Applying for a visa or e-visa

Find out how to apply for a visa from the [Indian Bureau of Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/df1a154d-8883-44bf-9750-8208149fbc8e). Depending on your requirements, you may be able to apply for a:

* [regular (paper) visa](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/index.html)
* [e-visa](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html) (check the website’s FAQs for restrictions on airports and seaports of entry)

Check your eligibility and any restrictions before you apply. Allow plenty of time for your application to be processed.

### Applicants of Pakistani origin

If you are of Pakistani origin, a British-Pakistani dual national or hold a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), the visa processing time will be substantially longer than other visa applications. More information is available from the [High Commission of India](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/persons-of-pakistani-origin/).

If you are a British-Pakistani dual national, you must apply for an Indian visa on your Pakistani passport. If you have renounced your Pakistani nationality, or cancelled your Pakistani passport, you will need to submit documentary proof of this.

### Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders

If you hold a valid Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, you can use this, along with your valid British passport, to visit India. You do not need a visa. If you have a Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) card, you will need to convert it to an OCI card. More information is available from the [High Commission of India](https://www.hcilondon.gov.in/page/oci-card/#:~:text=PIO%20Card%20holders%20can%20apply,%2F%2D%20plus%20VFS%20service%20charges) and the [Indian Bureau of Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/2484ead3-2c0b-4c05-af7f-f885726496d4).

### E-arrival card

Foreign nationals arriving in India must complete an [e-arrival card](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/earrival/) online before reaching immigration. This digital disembarkation form replaces the paper-based arrival card, although paper forms will continue to be accepted until March 2026.

The online e-arrival card can be completed up to 72 hours before you arrive. More details are available on the [Indian visa website](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/). The e-arrival card is not a visa, and you will still need a separate valid visa or OCI card to enter India.

### Extending your visa

It’s illegal to overstay your visa in India. Make sure you leave the country before your visa expires or get an official extension if needed. More information is available from the [Indian Bureau of Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/0b24515d-587b-44ea-a48b-b67d478b17f5).

### If you’re hospitalised

If you or someone you’re travelling with has a short-term tourist visa and is hospitalised, you may be able to [extend or convert to a medical visa](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/51280760-1ddb-4c72-8e1e-02b5731ef7a9).

Make sure you get your passport stamped

Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport when you arrive in India. You’ll need to show it when you leave, so border control officers know you have not overstayed your visa.

## Registering with the authorities

Hotels, hostels and other accommodation providers must register foreign guests with the [Foreigners Regional Registration Office](https://indianfrro.gov.in/efrro/home). Make sure your accommodation provider registers you [using the online C-form](https://indianfrro.gov.in/frro/FormC).

You will need your passport with a valid visa to get accommodation in country. British nationals who have overstayed their Indian visa have found it difficult to find accommodation.

If you plan to stay in India for more than 180 days and do not hold an OCI card, you must register within 14 days of arrival with the [Foreigners Regional Registration Office](https://indianfrro.gov.in/efrro/home). You could be denied permission to leave if you do not do this.

You may need to register your stay depending on the type of visa you hold, check if you need to.

## Exit requirements

When you leave India, officials will check when you entered the country. If you do not have an entry stamp, for example if you have a newly issued passport or an emergency travel document, you must [apply for a special exit permit before you travel](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/content/pages/c1c55e3a-0317-478e-8591-b1c8effc5fab). If you need to apply for an exit permit, you can only apply on the [Foreigners Regional Registration Office](https://indianfrro.gov.in/) from within India. It can take between 5 and 15 working days for straightforward applications. Factor this into your timeframe to leave India when you are booking flights.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter India, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a:

* yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* polio vaccine if you’re coming from a polio-affected country

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s India guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/105/india#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of India](https://www.cbic.gov.in/entities/internationalTravellers). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into India

There are restrictions on bringing Indian rupees into India. Visitors, including residents and tourists, must follow [Reserve Bank of India guidelines](https://m.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=66#q4).

If you’re visiting India, you can bring cash, travellers cheques (in British pounds or another foreign currency) or a bank card with you and exchange or withdraw rupees in India.

You must declare any amount above 5,000 US dollars in notes, or 10,000 US dollars in notes and travellers cheques combined.
