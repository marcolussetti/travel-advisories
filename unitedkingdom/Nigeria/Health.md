# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 to report an emergency.

There is no national ambulance service and hospital-owned services are extremely limited. You may need to get local advice or arrange local transport.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Nigeria](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/165/nigeria#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you must pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Nigeria](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/165/nigeria) including:

* schistosomiasis
* Zika virus
* malaria and dengue

## Medication

Pharmacies are widely available in Nigeria. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.

Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If you need a new prescription, a doctor in Nigeria can issue one for a fee. Take your existing packaging to show them exactly what you need.

## Healthcare in Nigeria

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Nigeria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nigeria-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners).

Medical standards differ from the UK and you will have to pay for any medical treatment at public hospitals. Private hospitals are more expensive. Local hospitals may be crowded and there can be shortages in medical supplies and equipment.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
