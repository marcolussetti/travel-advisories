Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.

## FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti

FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation. There are currently no British consular officials in Haiti and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person in Haiti.

British nationals may get consular services assistance at our [diplomatic mission in the Dominican Republic](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-santo-domingo).

If you choose to travel to or stay in Haiti against FCDO advice, try to avoid all crowds and public events, and take appropriate security precautions.

## Hurricane Melissa

Local authorities continue to monitor the weather system closely. There is a Hurricane Watch in effect for Haiti.
