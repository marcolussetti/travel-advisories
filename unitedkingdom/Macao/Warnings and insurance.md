This travel advice covers the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR). For mainland China, see [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china).

## Dual Chinese-British nationality

Macao does not recognise dual nationality. If you have both British and Chinese nationality, the local authorities may treat you as a Chinese citizen, even if you enter Macao on a full “British citizen” passport. If this is the case, the British Consulate-General may not be able to offer you consular help.

If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, carry evidence that you have done so.

See guidance on [nationality in China](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china).
