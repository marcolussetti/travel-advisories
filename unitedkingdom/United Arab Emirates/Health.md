# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 998 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for the United Arab Emirates (UAE)](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/233/united-arab-emirates#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in the UAE](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/233/united-arab-emirates).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

In the UAE, some UK prescribed and over-the-counter medicines are considered controlled substances. You must get approval in advance from the UAE Ministry of Health to bring medication. [Apply online to bring medication to the UAE](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/issue-of-permit-to-import-medicines-for-personal-use). The UAE authorities advise that applications are processed within 5 working days.

## Healthcare in the UAE

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in the UAE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English.

Healthcare facilities in the UAE are similar to those in the UK, but you may be stopped from using them without travel insurance or without the means to pay medical fees. You may be prevented from leaving the UAE if you are unable to pay your medical bill. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There is [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in the UAE](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-united-arab-emirates#healthcare-in-uae).
