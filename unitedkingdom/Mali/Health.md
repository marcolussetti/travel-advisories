# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

The emergency number is 15 but emergency response capacity is very limited. Take local advice and arrange your own transport to a medical centre or hospital.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Mali](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/140/mali#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Mali,](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/140/mali) including:

* typhoid and cholera
* rabies
* Zika virus
* malaria and dengue
* yellow fever
* meningitis

You should drink only boiled or bottled water, and avoid ice in drinks.

## Medication

Pharmacies are easily identifiable throughout Bamako. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Mali

Medical facilities in Mali are very limited. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
