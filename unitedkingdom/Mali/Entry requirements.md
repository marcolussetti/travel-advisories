# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK, who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Mali’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Mali set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Malian Embassy in Europe](https://www.amba-mali.be/), which covers the UK.

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Mali, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Mali. The application and payment process is now fully online via the [Malian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website](https://diplomatiemdc.gouv.ml/vitrine/).

An entry permit will be issued electronically once approved. There is no need to send documents to the Malian Embassy in Brussels, which covers the UK.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Mali, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination.

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Mali](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/140/mali#Vaccine_Recommendations) guide.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into or out of Mali](https://douanes.gouv.ml/). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

You must get an export permit from the Ministry of Arts and Culture to take any cultural or archaeological objects out of Mali. You can get this from the director of the National Museum.
