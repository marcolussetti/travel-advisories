Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

FCDO advises against all travel to Mali, except to Bamako, due to the risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps.

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to Bamako and to places within 25km of Bamako due to the risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps.

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel](/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security).

## UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Mali, especially outside Bamako. If the security situation deteriorates, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the help it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to help you to evacuate in an emergency.

If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the [British Embassy in Bamako](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bamako).

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
