Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all travel to Mali

FCDO advises against all travel to the whole of the Mali due to the unpredictable security conditions.

If you’re in Mali, you should leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so.

The international airport in Bamako is open, and commercial flights are available. Do not try to leave Mali by overland routes to neighbouring countries as this is too dangerous. This is due to terrorist attacks along national highways.

Terrorist group Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) has implemented blockades on key routes throughout Southern and Western Mali, including the capital city of Bamako. These blockades are targeting fuel trucks and are enforcing checkpoints for individuals attempting to pass through them. Attacks can occur at any time.

There is a high threat of kidnapping and criminal activity across Mali, including in the capital, Bamako.

If you choose to remain in Mali, you do so at your own risk. You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government.

For more detail see [Fuel shortages](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security#fuelshortages) and [Terrorism](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security#Terrorism) in Mali in the Safety and security page.

If you are a British national already in Mali, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

## UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Mali, especially outside Bamako.

Do not rely on FCDO being able to help you to evacuate in an emergency.

If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the [British Embassy in Bamako](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bamako).

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
