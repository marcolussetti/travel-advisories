## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

FCDO advises against all travel to Mali, except for within 15km of the Tower of Africa located in Bamako.

FCDO also advises against all but essential travel  to the area within 15km of the Tower of Africa located in Bamako.

This is due to the risk of terrorist attacks and kidnaps.

## Increased risk during public holidays

There is an increased risk of a terrorist attack near and during public holidays, and periods of national or religious significance in Mali, including Bamako.

For more detail, see [Terrorism in Mali](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mali/safety-and-security) in the Safety and security page.

## UK government support

Support for British nationals is severely limited in Mali, especially outside Bamako. If the security situation deteriorates, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the help it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to help you to evacuate in an emergency.

If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the [British Embassy in Bamako](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bamako).

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
