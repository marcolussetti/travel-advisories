# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for St Kitts and Nevis](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/207/st-kitts-and-nevis#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in St Kitts and Nevis](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/207/st-kitts-and-nevis).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in St Kitts and Nevis

The main government hospital in St Kitts is the Joseph N France General Hospital in Brumaire. For Nevis the main government hospital is Alexandra Hospital in Charlestown. Both hospitals can provide many forms of treatment. However, serious cases may require emergency evacuation.

Medical treatment in St Kitts and Nevis is expensive. If you choose to be treated at a private medical facility, check first if they accept medical travel insurance.

Make sure you have adequate medical travel insurance and or accessible funds to cover the cost of medical treatment and repatriation.
