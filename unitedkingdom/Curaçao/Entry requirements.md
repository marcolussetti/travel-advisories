# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Curaçao’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Curaçao set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Netherlands Embassy in the UK](https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/web/united-kingdom/about-us/contact-embassy-london).

## Passport validity requirements

Your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Digital immigration card

You must complete a [digital immigration card](https://dicardcuracao.com/portal) 48 hours before you arrive in Curaçao.

You must also complete it if you’re travelling through Curaçao.

## Visa requirements

You can stay in Curaçao for up to 90 days in a calendar year without a visa. You can request an extension beyond 90 days at immigration if you can show you have travel insurance for the duration of your extended stay.
