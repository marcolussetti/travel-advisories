# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 912 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Curaçao](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/44/caribbean-islands-netherlands#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Curaçao](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/44/caribbean-islands-netherlands).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

## Healthcare in Curaçao

Curaçao has 3 local hospitals. Curaçao Medical Center is the largest hospital with an extensive emergency room and the only intensive care unit on the island. Taams Clinic and The Antillean Adventist Hospital also offer a wide range of medical services and specialists.

In case of an emergency, the attending doctor will be able to make an informed decision on the best hospital to send you to if necessary.

## Health insurance cards

The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) is not valid in Curaçao. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
