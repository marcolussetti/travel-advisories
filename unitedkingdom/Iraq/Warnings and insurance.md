## Consular support

Consular support is severely limited in areas where FCDO advises against travel.

## Regional risks

There is a heightened risk of regional tension. Escalation could lead to travel disruption and other unanticipated impacts.

British nationals should take sensible precautions, considering their own individual circumstances. These include:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* follow advice from the local authorities and sign up to receive information and alerts
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, stay indoors or find the nearest safe building or designated shelter. An interior stairwell or a room with as few external walls or windows as possible may provide additional protection

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel despite FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
