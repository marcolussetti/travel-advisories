Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## Areas where FCDO advises against travel

Federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq

FCDO advises against all travel to Federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This is due to recent escalation in regional conflict. There is significant risk of further escalation, and events are fast-moving and unpredictable.

Find out more about [why FCDO advises against travel](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iraq/regional-risks).

## Consular support

Consular support is severely limited in areas where FCDO advises against travel.

## Regional escalation

Regional escalation poses significant security risks and has led to travel disruption.

British nationals should:

* read [If you’re affected by a crisis abroad - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas). This includes guidance on “how to prepare for a crisis” with suggestions on what you might include in your emergency supplies and “what to do in a crisis”
* follow advice from the local authorities and sign up to receive information and alerts
* sign up to FCDO Travel Advice email alerts
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* stay away from areas around security or military facilities
* keep your departure plans under review, and ensure your travel documents are up to date
* if you are advised to take shelter, stay indoors or find the nearest safe building or designated shelter. An interior stairwell or a room with as few external walls or windows as possible may provide additional protection

## Travel insurance

If you choose to travel despite FCDO advice, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
