# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Iraq’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Iraq set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Iraqi Embassy in the UK](https://mofa.gov.iq/london/en/embassy-of-the-republic-of-iraq-in-london/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Iraq, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least one blank page.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Iraq.

You are no longer able to get a visit visa on arrival in Iraq. You must apply for a visa on the [e-visa portal of the Government of Iraq](https://eservice.evisa.iq/) at least 24 hours before you travel. The visa costs $160 and is valid for 60 days. Ensure that you have a return ticket in place or a ticket out of Iraq to a third destination. Without such a ticket in place, there is a risk of the airline refusing boarding.

### e-visa for Kurdistan Region

The government of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has introduced a new e-visa process. You can find the details and apply on the [e-visa portal of the Kurdistan Region Government](https://visit.gov.krd/). It is also possible to obtain a visa on arrival. Both types of visas are valid for travel in KRI only.

## Weapon Authority Cards

Make sure you have the right documents when you arrive in Iraq, including Weapon Authority Cards (WAC) if you are carrying weapons.

Foreign nationals have been arrested for failing to provide the correct documentation when requested.

## HIV and hepatitis test

You must have a blood test for HIV and hepatitis unless you’re travelling on a visit visa. You must take the test within 10 days of arrival and repeat it every 90 days while you’re in Iraq. Guidance on where to go for the blood test is available at the airport when you arrive.

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Iraq. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking money into or out of Iraq

On entering or exiting Iraq, you must declare:

* all local currency over 200,000 Iraqi dinars
* all currency or items valued over 10,000 US Dollars or the same value in any other foreign currency
