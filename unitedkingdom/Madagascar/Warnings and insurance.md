Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

## FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Madagascar

## Protests in Antananarivo

Protests are taking place throughout Madagascar. Antananarivo has seen significant incidents of violence, including looting, which has spread to other towns and cities. Roads to Antananarivo airport have sometimes been blocked by protests and some internal and international flights have been cancelled.

The situation remains very fluid; we expect curfews to remain in place in Antananarivo and in other cities.  If you are currently in Madagascar, follow local advice and avoid all large gatherings and political demonstrations. Check for messaging from your airline or tour operator before travelling to an airport.
