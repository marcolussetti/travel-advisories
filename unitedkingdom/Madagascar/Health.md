# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 117 from a mobile or 17 from a landline and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Madagascar](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/134/madagascar)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Madagascar](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/134/madagascar) including:

## Healthcare in Madagascar

Although there are public and private hospitals in Antananarivo, they can only handle routine operations. For complex surgery, patients are flown to Mauritius, South Africa or Réunion. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
