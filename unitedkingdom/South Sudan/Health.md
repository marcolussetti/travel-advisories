# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

South Sudan does not have an emergency medical public phone number. There are limited private ambulance services, but you will have to register with a private clinic first.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccination recommendations for South Sudan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/202/south-sudan#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in South Sudan](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/202/south-sudan), including:

* malaria
* cholera
* yellow fever

The risk of malaria in South Sudan is high. You can find more information about malaria on [TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/202/south-sudan#Malaria).

The South Sudanese Ministry of Health has issued a [statement](https://moh.gov.ss/news-details_copypress.php?id=18) about the outbreak of cholera. You can find more information on cholera on [TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/202/south-sudan#Vaccine_Recommendations).

Altitude sickness is a risk in Eastern Equatoria near the border with Uganda, where there are mountains of over 3,000 metres. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in South Sudan

Health facilities are extremely limited throughout South Sudan. Many medical issues require medical evacuation to neighbouring hubs (Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, are the most common). During the rainy season, flights are often forced to remain on the ground for hours. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in South Sudan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-sudan-doctors) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
