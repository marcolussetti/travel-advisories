# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Suriname’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Suriname set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Surinamese Embassy in Paris, France](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Suriname, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Arrival Report

All travellers to and from Suriname are required to complete an [Immigration and Customs Form [ICF]](https://icf.sr/) up to three days before arrival and departure.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must get a visa and meet the [Suriname government’s entry requirements](https://suriname.vfsevisa.com/suriname/online/home/information).

It’s illegal to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.

## Vaccine requirements
