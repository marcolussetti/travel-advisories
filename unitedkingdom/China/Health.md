# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 120 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for China](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of China. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

See [what health risks you’ll face in China](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china), including:

* avian influenza
* dengue – present in Guangdong Province and some parts of China, mainly during the rainy season from May to November

Tap water is generally not safe to drink. Only drink bottled water

The Chinese authorities react quickly to outbreaks of any infectious disease. They might enforce quarantine if you show symptoms.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

If you’re take prescription medication, make sure you bring enough with you or have access to a supply in China. Certain medicines may not be available and you may be not allowed to bring others into the country. For more information, check with your GP and the [Chinese Embassy](http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/) before travelling.

## Healthcare in China

Healthcare is not free in China and can be very expensive. Make sure you have appropriate travel and medical insurance covering healthcare and medical evacuation and repatriation. For more information, see [medical treatment in China](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-treatment-in-china).

FCDO has a list of [doctors and medical facilities in China](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-hospitals-in-china) where some staff will speak English.
