# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Belize’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Belize High Commission in the UK](https://belizehighcommission.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Belize, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ more than 3 months after the date you arrive. Some airlines may refuse boarding if the expiry date is not more than 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Immigration and customs declaration form

All travellers transiting Belize through the Philip Goldson International Airport are required to complete an immigration and customs declaration form. Whilst paper declarations will still be accepted during the phased transition to a fully digital system, the Belizean authorities recommend completing the [digital form](https://belizetravel.immigration.gov.bz/Belize_Digital_Forms/) prior to travel.

## Visa requirements

You can visit Belize without a visa for 30 days.

If you want to extend your stay, it will cost 200 Belize dollars for each additional 30 days. You should go to the nearest office of the [Belize Immigration and Nationality Department](https://immigration.gov.bz/permits/visitors-permit/) and request a new stamp.

## Departure tax

If you leave Belize by land, or by water crossing to Guatemala or Mexico, you must pay a departure tax of 40 Belize dollars or 20 US dollars at the border. If leaving by air, the tax is usually included in the airfare.

## Travelling with children

Children aged 17 and under who are travelling on their own, or with an adult who is not their parent, must carry a notarised letter to prove parental responsibility, or consent to travel from the parent or guardian. Children travelling with one parent must also have a notarised letter of authority from the other parent giving consent for travel.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Belize guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/26/belize).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Belize. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Items that need to be declared will be listed on the customs declaration form. Contact the [Belize Customs and Excise Administration](https://www.customs.gov.bz/contact.html) for more information.
