# Regional risks

This section has safety advice for regions of Zimbabwe. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.

You should also read [FCDOâ€™s overall travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/zimbabwe) and [safety and security advice](/foreign-travel-advice/zimbabwe/safety-and-security).

## Rural areas

There continue to be occasional invasions of commercial farms, sometimes accompanied by violence and threats. Take care when visiting farming areas that you are not familiar with.

## Mining areas

Mining areas are often restricted. Turn back if you are stopped and told that you are not allowed to access a particular area.
