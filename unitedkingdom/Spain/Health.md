# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Spain](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/203/spain#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Spain](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/203/spain), including:

* dengue
* biting insects and ticks

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Spain. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. There are details in the [guide to getting healthcare in Spain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain).

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Spain

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Spain](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners) where some staff will speak English.

### Health insurance cards

To get medically necessary state healthcare in Spain, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
* what treatment counts as medically necessary

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:

* changes to travel and accommodation bookings
* additional standard costs for treatment
* medical repatriation to the UK
* treatment that is ruled non-urgent

There is more [guidance on healthcare if you’re visiting Spain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain). There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Spain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-spain-including-the-balearic-and-canary-islands).

### Hospital treatment

If you need hospital treatment in Spain, you’re more likely to receive appropriate care in public healthcare facilities. However, in some tourist areas there may not be any public healthcare facilities nearby. Your insurance or medical assistance company will be able to provide further details.

Some hotels may call private doctors or ambulances to take patients to private hospitals. The GHIC or EHIC will not be accepted there.

### Use of face masks

Due to an increase in respiratory infections such as flu and COVID-19, you may have to wear a face mask at doctors’ surgeries, hospitals and pharmacies. Rules on face masks may vary by region. Follow the advice of the local authorities and make sure you are aware of the measures in place.
