# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in Spain

Telephone: 112 (ambulance, fire, police)

## Reporting crime

To report a crime, including stolen property and lost or stolen passports, you can file a police report (‘denuncia’) at the nearest station of the:

* National Police (‘Policia Nacional’)
* regional police (‘Ertzaintza’ in the Basque Country, ‘Mossos d’Esquadra’ in Catalonia and ‘Policia Foral’ in Navarre)
* Civil Guard (‘Guardia Civil’)

Some Spanish cities also offer a [Foreign Tourist Assistance Service](https://www.policia.es/_es/dependencias_localizador_accesible.php) (‘Servicio de Atención al Turista Extranjero’ or ‘SATE’) where you can report crimes in English.

While in Spain, you can [file a police report online](https://denuncias.policia.es/OVD/) for minor offences such as stolen bags or thefts from your car. If you’ve had belongings stolen, you may need to get a police report for insurance purposes.

If you want to report a violent crime or sexual assault, you must go in person to the nearest police station.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
