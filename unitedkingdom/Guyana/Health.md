# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 913 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Guyana](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/99/guyana#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

Go to TravelHealthPro to see [what health risks you’ll face in Guyana](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/99/guyana), including:

* yellow fever
* dengue
* Zika virus

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Guyana. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

In 2016, the UNAIDS/WHO Working Group estimated that around 8,500 people in Guyana were living with HIV. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Guyana

Medical facilities are very limited, even in Georgetown. There are none in remote areas. Standards of medical practice are low and you should arrange an evacuation for any serious or invasive treatment if possible. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Guyana](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guyana-list-of-list-of-medical-facilities-practioners/list-of-medical-facilities-in-guyana) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Guyana](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-guyana#health).
