# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Guyana’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Guyana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Guyana High Commission in the UK](http://guyanahclondon.co.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Guyana, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will not be able to enter Guyana if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You do not need a visa to visit Guyana. Visitors can normally stay for 30 days, but you can apply for one-month extensions from Guyana’s [immigration and support services](https://eservices.iss.gov.gy/visitor-visa?new=1).

The Guyanese authorities can arrest visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. You could get a one-year prison sentence, a fine of up to 50,000 Guyana dollars (about 250 US dollars) and deportation – at your own expense – upon your release.

Check the requirements for work or student visas with the [Guyana High Commission in the UK](http://www.guyanahclondon.co.uk/) well before you travel.

## Vaccine requirements

You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, including yellow fever, see [TravelHealthPro’s Guyana guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/99/guyana#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guyana. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
