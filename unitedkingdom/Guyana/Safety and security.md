# Safety and security

## Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).

### Terrorism in Guyana

Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Guyana, attacks cannot be ruled out.

## Political situation

There are occasional protests and political demonstrations throughout Guyana. Stay away from demonstrations as unrest can occur without notice.

### Border areas

Venezuela disputes the legitimacy of its border with Guyana. Political tensions remain and the security situation along the border remains tense.

There continues to be a dispute between Suriname and Guyana over the land in the New River Triangle area in the south-east of Guyana.

Organised crime in these border areas is common and increasing.

Check with local authorities if travelling near the border areas, both of which are in remote areas.

## Crime

Crime levels are significant, and police capacity is low. Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common, and violent crime continues to be a risk.

### Violent attacks and personal safety

Attacks and muggings have occurred in broad daylight but are more common at night, and have included the use of knives or firearms. They may target tourists, particularly those that show obvious signs of wealth.

Foreign and Guyanese nationals have reportedly been targeted in:

* Stabroek Market in Georgetown
* Tiger Bay and Albouystown in Georgetown
* Sophia, south Georgetown
* Buxton
* Agricola

Foreign visitors have been assaulted in Georgetown’s Botanical Gardens. If possible, visit with an organised group and avoid taking valuables.

There have been incidents of gangs following cars from Cheddi Jagan International Airport and then attacking their victims when they reach their destination. Always drive with windows closed and doors locked.

Take care when exchanging money or buying goods on the street. Go inside the money exchange or shop, or use ATMs inside banks or shopping centres. Consider arranging to be collected by a car or taxi booked by your hotel or with a licensed operator.

### Protecting your belongings

Thieves will take items from hotel rooms, parked vehicles or luggage if it is unattended. Keep your passports, money, tickets, mobile phones and other valuables as secure as you can, and use hotel safes or safe deposit boxes if possible.

### Scams

Scammers often offer travellers in South America free air tickets to Guyana. On arrival their ‘sponsors’ will only allow them to leave Guyana if they carry a ‘package’ (usually cocaine). The authorities at the airport will stop and search foreigners that fit this known profile.

## Laws and cultural differences

### Illegal drugs and prison sentences

You can get lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines for possession or the trafficking of drugs. The minimum jail sentence for drug offences is 3 years, and prison conditions in Guyana are tough. Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry any items that do not belong to you.

### LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex sexual activity is illegal. In practice, these laws are rarely enforced, and there is growing local support for LGBT+ rights. You could receive negative attention for showing affection in public.

### Hotel safety

Fires have occurred in Guyanese hotels, and some hotels have poor fire safety procedures. Check evacuation procedures and exit routes when you arrive, and speak to hotel management if you have any concerns.

## Transport risks

### Road travel

If you are planning to drive in Guyana, see [information on driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad).

You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Guyana. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to [update it to a photocard licence](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence) or get the [correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit). After 60 days you’ll need to buy a [4-week foreign driving permit](https://www.gra.gov.gy/driving-with-a-foreign-licence/).

If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.

### Driving standards and road conditions

Driving in Guyana can be dangerous because of reckless drivers, frequent hazards, poor street lighting, and poor road conditions. Drive with caution and take extreme care if you choose to drive at night. Keep a safe distance from minibuses – minibus drivers are responsible for many of the road accidents in Guyana.

If possible, avoid travel to and from Cheddi Jagan International Airport late at night and before dawn. There have been fatal accidents caused by erratic driving.

### Taxis and minibuses

Although private taxis can be targeted by robbers, they are the safest way for visitors to get around Georgetown. Use taxis from reputable companies and book them in advance or from official hotel taxi ranks.

Do not hail taxis from the roadside, and avoid using “public” minibuses unless pre-booked from reputable sources.

### River and sea travel

There have been armed attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Guyana and Suriname. If you’re travelling by sea, [read about the regional risks at sea](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety).

If you are travelling on Guyana’s rivers, use registered boat services equipped with life jackets. Do not travel by boat after dark.

Only use scheduled ferry services when crossing the Corentyne River between Guyana and Suriname. Using water taxis (‘backtracking’) from Suriname to Guyana is illegal and can lead to arrest, imprisonment and then deportation.

## Extreme weather and natural disasters

Find out what you can do to [prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones).

### Flooding

Guyana is vulnerable to flooding. The main rainy seasons are generally May to June and December to January. The coast of Guyana is below sea level and protected by a sea defence and dam system. However, the anti-flooding infrastructure and drainage systems are poorly maintained
