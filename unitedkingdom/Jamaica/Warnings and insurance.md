## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa is expected to make landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica on Tuesday 28 October. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Jamaica and, whilst Melissa’s exact trajectory is not known, it is expected to bring exceptional levels of rainfall to the whole of Jamaica. There are estimates for up to 700 millimetres of rain, storm surges around coastal areas bringing waves of up to 4 metres, and winds of up to 135 miles per hour. Catastrophic flash floods and landslides are likely.
