## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa made landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica on Tuesday 28 October. Hurricane Melissa brought exceptional levels of rainfall and strong winds to the whole of Jamaica, causing widespread damage to roads and infrastructure and disruption to electricity and other utilities services, including internet. There are also shortages of food and water and access to currency. Access to healthcare in worst affected areas is limited. All Western parishes have suffered significant damage. The worst affected parishes are currently Westmoreland, St Elizabeth, St James, Hanover and Manchester. Exercise caution if you are travelling within Jamaica.

Continue to follow the guidance of [local authorities](https://jis.gov.jm/news/). If your hotel is unable to provide accommodation, get in contact with other hotels in the area to see if they have capacity. We have closed Register Your Presence, however if you need consular assistance, contact the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on:
