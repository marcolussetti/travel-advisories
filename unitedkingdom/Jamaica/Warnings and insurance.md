## Hurricane Melissa

If you are a British national in Jamaica, FCDO strongly encourages you to [Register Your Presence](https://www.register.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/jamaica-20251028/tell-the-uk-government-youre-in-jamaica). This will allow FCDO to share important updates, including information on UK government charter flights.

Hurricane Melissa made landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica on Tuesday 28 October. Hurricane Melissa brought exceptional levels of rainfall and strong winds to the whole of Jamaica, causing widespread damage to roads and infrastructure and disruption to electricity and other utilities services, including internet. There are also shortages of food and water and access to currency. Access to healthcare in worst affected areas is limited.  All Western parishes have suffered significant damage. The worst affected parishes are currently Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Hanover and Manchester . You should exercise caution if you must travel within Jamaica.

You should continue to follow the guidance of [local authorities](https://jis.gov.jm/news/), especially in the event of any evacuation orders

### Return flights to the UK

Passenger operations have now resumed from Norman Manley International Airport ([@NMIA](https://x.com/NMIA_Airport?t=YwsCRXzhGRoDxM-jVJJenA&s=08)) in Kingston and Ian Fleming International Airport near Ocho Rios. Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay ([@MBjairport](https://x.com/MBJAIRPORT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)) remains closed for commercial flights.

The UK government is preparing some flights to help transport British nationals out of Jamaica. Travellers should contact their airline or travel provider in the first instance to see if commercial options are available, and if they have already booked a flight home to confirm if it is still operating.

Windrush generations with indefinite leave to remain in the UK are eligible for the UK government flights and should urgently contact the FCDO to be sent the flight registration form:

* on +1 (876) 936 0700 (Jamaica)
* on +1 (305) 400 4600 (USA)
* or +44 (0)20 7008 5000 (UK)

The FCDO will directly contact those who are allocated a seat on the flight and British nationals should not make their way to the airport unless they are contacted.

British nationals who have already registered via the Register Your Presence portal will automatically be contacted and provided with a link to the booking portal . If you are a British national in Jamaica wanting to leave on a flight and have not already [registered your presence](https://www.register.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/jamaica-20251028/tell-the-uk-government-youre-in-jamaica), you should do so immediately.

### Shelter

In the aftermath of a hurricane, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. See ‘Extreme weather and natural disasters’ on the [‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jamaica/safety-and-security).

If your hotel is unable to provide accommodation, you should get in contact with other hotels in the area to see if they have capacity.

The Jamaican government have published a list of shelters which may be able to give a level of accommodation or signpost you to [relevant safe places](https://www.odpem.org.jm/shelters/?shelter_parish_field=st.+james#).

## Before you travel

No travel can be guaranteed safe. Read all the advice in this guide and see [support for British nationals abroad](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad) for information about specific travel topics.

### Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
