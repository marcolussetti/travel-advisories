## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa made landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica in October 2025. All Western parishes suffered significant damage and some communities are still without electricity and piped water. In the worst affected areas, access to healthcare is limited, and there is still debris and standing water that carries health risks, including water-borne and mosquito-borne diseases, and [Leptospirosis](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/113/jamaica#Outbreaks) from contact with contaminated water.

## Before you travel
