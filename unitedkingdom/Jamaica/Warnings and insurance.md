## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa is expected to intensify into a major hurricane on Saturday 25 October. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Jamaican government is closing airports nationwide, with Kingston Norman Manley International Airport closing from 8pm local time on 25 October and other airports expected to follow. Melissa’s exact trajectory is not known but it is expected to affect the whole of Jamaica in some way. There are estimates for up to 700 millimetres of rain, storm surges around coastal areas bringing waves of up to 4 metres, and winds of up to 135 miles per hour. Catastrophic flash floods and landslides are likely. The Jamaican government has published a list of [available hurricane shelters](https://www.odpem.org.jm/shelters/) in advance of anticipated landfall.

We urge those in Jamaica to monitor local and international weather updates, including from the [Meteorological Service for Jamaica](https://metservice.gov.jm/) and the [US National Hurricane Centre](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/), and follow the guidance of local authorities, especially in the event of any evacuation orders. See ‘Extreme weather and natural disasters’ on the [‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jamaica/safety-and-security).
