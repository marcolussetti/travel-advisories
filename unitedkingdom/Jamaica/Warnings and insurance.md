## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa is expected to make landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica on Tuesday 28 October. If you are a British national in Jamaica, FCDO strongly encourages you to [Register Your Presence](https://www.register.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/jamaica-20251028/tell-the-uk-government-youre-in-jamaica). This will allow FCDO to share important updates.

Hurricane Melissa is expected to bring exceptional levels of rainfall to the whole of Jamaica. There are estimates for up to 1000 millimetres of rain, storm surges around coastal areas bringing waves of up to 4 metres, and winds of up to 170 miles per hour. Catastrophic flash floods and landslides are likely with severe damage to infrastructure expected.

The Jamaican government has closed its international airports until further notice. You may wish to monitor live updates from the Jamaican airport authorities regarding the status of Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston ([@NMIA](https://x.com/NMIA_Airport?t=YwsCRXzhGRoDxM-jVJJenA&s=08)) and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay ([@MBJAIRPORT](https://x.com/MBJAIRPORT?t=jw1Y8HGNdnIHwgjh1zmEmw&s=08)).You should monitor and follow the advice of your tour operator.

Please continue to monitor  local and international weather updates, including from the [Meteorological Service for Jamaica](https://metservice.gov.jm/) and the [US National Hurricane Centre](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/), and follow the guidance of [local authorities](https://jis.gov.jm/news/), especially in the event of any evacuation orders. The Jamaican government has published a list of [available hurricane shelters](https://www.odpem.org.jm/shelters/) in advance of anticipated landfall.

In the aftermath of a hurricane, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. See ‘Extreme weather and natural disasters’ on the [‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jamaica/safety-and-security).
