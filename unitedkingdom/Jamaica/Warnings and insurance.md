## Hurricane Melissa

Hurricane Melissa made landfall as a major hurricane in Jamaica on Tuesday 28 October. Hurricane Melissa brought exceptional levels of rainfall and strong winds to the whole of Jamaica, causing widespread damage to roads and infrastructure and disruption to electricity and other utilities services, including internet. There are also shortages of food and water and access to currency. Access to healthcare in worst affected areas is limited. All Western parishes have suffered significant damage. The worst affected parishes are currently Westmoreland, St Elizabeth, St James, Hanover and Manchester. Exercise caution if you are  travelling within Jamaica.

Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay ([@MBjairport](https://x.com/MBJAIRPORT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)) has resumed a limited number of commercial flights. Travellers should contact their airline or travel provider.

### Shelter

In the aftermath of a hurricane, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. See ‘Extreme weather and natural disasters’ on the [‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jamaica/safety-and-security).

If your hotel is unable to provide accommodation, you should get in contact with other hotels in the area to see if they have capacity.

The Jamaican government have published a list of shelters which may be able to give a level of accommodation or signpost you to [relevant safe places](https://www.odpem.org.jm/shelters/?shelter_parish_field=st.+james).

## Before you travel

### Travel insurance

If you choose to travel, research your destinations and [get appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance). Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
