# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Cameroon](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/40/cameroon#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Cameroon](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/40/cameroon), including:

* Zika virus
* malaria and dengue
* yellow fever
* cholera

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Cameroon. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Cameroon

Medical facilities in Cameroon are below UK standards. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation to Europe will be necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Cameroon](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/living-in-cameroon).
