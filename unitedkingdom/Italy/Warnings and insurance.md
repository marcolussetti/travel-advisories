:   New information about strikes and demonstrations in Italy ('Warnings and insurance' page).

This travel advice also covers Vatican City.

## Strikes and demonstrations

There is a 24-hour National Transport strike on Friday 3 October which will cause disruption to travel.  This will affect trains from 9pm on Thursday 2 October and all transport from midnight. Check schedule details with transport providers.

Demonstrations are planned in Rome for Saturday 4 October. This is likely to attract a large number of protestors and cause disruption to roads and transport in the city centre. Plan your day and avoid any demonstrations.

Read more about industrial action and demonstrations on the [Safety and security page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/safety-and-security).

## Jubilee 2025 - Holy Year

The Jubilee, known as the Holy Year, will take place in Rome from 24 December 2024 to 6 January 2026.
