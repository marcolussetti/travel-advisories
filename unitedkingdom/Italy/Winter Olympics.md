## Travel insurance

Get appropriate travel insurance as soon as you book. Check that it covers the places you will visit, the duration of your visit and any planned activities.

As well as travel insurance, make sure you have a UK Global Health Insurance card (GHIC) before travelling. Read our advice on health insurance cards on the [Health](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/health) page.

## Transport to the various events

Transport routes are likely to be very busy, and local authorities may ask you to enter or leave by specific routes.

Make sure you:

* plan your journey
* utilise the park and ride or train and ride services
* leave plenty of time, particularly on key events

Winter weather and road conditions may extend your travel times so check the [official Olympics website](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026) to plan your journey.

## Accommodation

There will be a very high demand for accommodation in the ski resorts as well as Milan and Verona so ensure to plan ahead.

## Increased security

Due to increased security and random police checks, you should carry your passport with you at all times.

## Increased risk of petty crime

The high number of travellers during the Winter Olympics could increase levels of petty crime.
