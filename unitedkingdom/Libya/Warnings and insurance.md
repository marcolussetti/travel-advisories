## Heightened military presence in Tripoli

On 12 May, armed clashes broke out across Tripoli. As of 14 May, a ceasefire has been agreed, and full-scale violence has largely stopped as of 10am on 15 May. The situation remains volatile and a return to violence is possible. Tripoli’s only functioning international airport, Mitiga, remains closed.

FCDO advises against all travel  to Libya except for the cities of Benghazi and Misrata, to which we advise against all but essential travel.

If you are a British national already in, or planning to travel to Tripoli, stay alert to local information and minimise movements around the city where possible. If you are in the vicinity of gunfire, remain indoors and away from windows. You should have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.

## UK government support

UK government support is limited in Libya. If you are in Libya and need urgent help from the UK government (for example, if you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died) [contact the British Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-tunis) who provide assistance for British nationals in Libya. In-person support is not available in Libya.
