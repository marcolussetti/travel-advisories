# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 or 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Ireland](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/109/ireland#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Ireland](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/109/ireland).

## Medication

You can use a UK prescription to get medicines, including special food required for medical reasons, from pharmacies in Ireland. You will have to pay in full for any prescription medicine.

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. If you have questions, contact the [Irish Embassy in the UK](https://www.ireland.ie/en/greatbritain/london/).
