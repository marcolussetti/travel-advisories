# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Ireland set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Irish Embassy in the UK](https://www.ireland.ie/en/greatbritain/london/).

## Passport and ID requirements

British nationals are not legally required to show a passport to enter Ireland, but it may be useful to carry in case you need to prove your identity.

Irish immigration officers are entitled to ask for proof of British nationality in the course of their work. Ferries and airlines may ask for ID. Check your carrier’s conditions of travel.

Check the [Ireland Citizens Information Board for guidance on acceptable ID](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/).

## Visa requirements

You can visit and remain indefinitely in Ireland under the [Common Travel Area rules](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance). British nationals do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland.

Although Ireland is in the EU, it is not part of the [Schengen area](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en), and Schengen rules do not apply.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Ireland guide](https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/109/ireland#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods you can take into and out of Ireland](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/info-travelling-duty-free/from-outside-eu/prohibited-restriced.aspx). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Travelling with pets

Read about [travelling to the EU with your pet](https://www.gov.uk/taking-your-pet-abroad/travelling-to-an-eu-country-or-northern-ireland) and check the [Irish entry requirements for pets](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/21d40-pet-travel/#bringing-an-unaccompanied-pet-cat-dog-or-ferret-into-ireland).

### Taking money into Ireland

Declare [cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/travelling-with-sending-cash/index.aspx). You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
