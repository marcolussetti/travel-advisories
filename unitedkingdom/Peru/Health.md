# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 106 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Peru](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/177/peru#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Peru](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/177/peru) including:

* Oropouche virus disease
* yellow fever
* malaria
* Zika virus

Altitude sickness is a serious risk in parts of Peru, including Cusco, Puno, the Colca Canyon and Kuelap. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

Diarrhoea caused by contaminated food or water is common and is potentially serious. See [more about food and water hygiene](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/food-and-water-hygiene/).

### Dengue outbreak

Peru is experiencing a major dengue outbreak following floods. See the ‘Outbreaks’ page of the [TravelHealthPro Peru guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/177/peru#Outbreaks) for more information.

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Many medications are available over the counter in Peru, but local prescriptions will be required for some.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Peru

Medical treatment is not easily available and can be more difficult to access outside of Lima. Make sure you have appropriate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip in Lima, dial one of the following numbers: +51 1 416 6767 (Lima - Alerta Med), or +51 1 467 4861 (Lima - Clave Medica) and ask for an ambulance. These services are private, so you will need to pay for them.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Peru](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/peru-list-of-lawyers/list-of-medical-facilities-in-peru) where some staff will speak English.

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
