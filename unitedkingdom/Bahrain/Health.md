# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Bahrain](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/20/bahrain#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Bahrain](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/20/bahrain).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

If you are using prescribed drugs, you should carry a doctor’s note. If you plan to bring prescription drugs into Bahrain, you may need to seek prior agreement from the authorities. Check with the nearest Bahrain Embassy or consulate before you travel.
