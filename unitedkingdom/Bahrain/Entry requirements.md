# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Bahrain’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Bahrain set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Bahrain Embassy in the UK](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/london/en/home/).

## Passport validity requirements

To enter Bahrain, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

### Bahraini-UK dual nationals

If you are a dual Bahraini-UK national the authorities may require you to enter and exit Bahrain on a Bahrain travel document only. If your Bahraini passport is not valid or in your possession, seek advice from your nearest Bahraini Embassy before you travel to Bahrain. Bahraini passport renewals whilst in Bahrain may take a long time and could potentially disrupt your travel plans. Decisions related to entering and exiting Bahrain are always made by the Bahraini authorities.

If you are not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Bahrain Embassy in the UK](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/london/en/home/) or Bahrain’s  Nationality, Passports and Residency Affairs [(NPRA)](https://www.npra.gov.bh/en/).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Bahrain.

### Applying for a visa

You can get a visa:

* in advance [online](http://www.evisa.gov.bh/)
* in advance from the [Bahrain Embassy in the UK](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/london/en/visitiors-visas)
* on arrival

Visas are automatically issued for a 2-week period, but visit visas for stays of up to 6 months are also available. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel when you apply.

You cannot start employment in Bahrain if you enter on a visit visa.

If you overstay your visa, there could be penalties, legal issues and your work visa could be cancelled.

You can apply to renew your visa at the [Nationality, Passports and Residential Affairs department](https://www.npra.gov.bh/en-inquiries-and-proposals/) at the Ministry of Interior.

### Applying for residency

You can apply for residency through the [Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA)](https://lmra.gov.bh/en/home).

You can be fined if you overstay your legal residency.

## Travel bans

You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you:

* are subject to a travel ban
* are involved in legal proceedings
* have unpaid debt
* are a child subject to a custody dispute

If you’re involved in a dispute, including civil and criminal disputes or immigration violation, you may be stopped from leaving the country. The travel ban will not be lifted until the issue is resolved. You may not know you’re subject to a travel ban until you try to leave or enter Bahrain. You can check with the [Bahrain Immigration Department](https://services.bahrain.bh/wps/portal/TravelBan_en) to see whether you’re subject to a travel ban.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Bahrain, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission).
