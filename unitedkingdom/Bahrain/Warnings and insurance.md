## Regional risks

Hostilities in the region and between Israel and Iran have the potential to deteriorate further, quickly and without warning. On 22 June the US launched military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and on 23 June Iran launched military strikes against a US military base in Qatar.

There is a possibility of travel disruption, including short-notice airspace closures, delayed and cancelled flights, and other unanticipated travel impacts.

As a precautionary measure we encourage you to:

* read the FCDO’s advice on [if you’re affected by a crisis abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas)
* monitor local and international media for the latest information
* be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities
* take shelter and stay away from windows if instructed. If you require urgent assistance call 999
* avoid military or security facilities
* check with relevant airlines for the latest updates before travelling
