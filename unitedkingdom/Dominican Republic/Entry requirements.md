# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the Dominican Republic’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in the Dominican Republic set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Embassy of the Dominican Republic in the UK](https://www.dominicanembassy.org.uk/).

## Passport validity requirements

Up until 30 November 2025, British passport holders can enter and leave the Dominican Republic for tourism purposes, as long as their passport remains valid for the duration of their visit. Rules may change after this date. Check the [Dominican Republic Ministry of Tourism website](https://www.godominicanrepublic.com/travel/entry-requirements/) for the latest information.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Checks at border control

You may be refused entry if you do not have proof of onward or return travel when you arrive in the country.

Border officials will take your fingerprints and take a photograph of you before allowing you into the country.
