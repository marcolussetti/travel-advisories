## Dominican Republic-Haiti border

FCDO [advises against all travel to Haiti](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/haiti) due to the volatile security situation.

Land and sea borders between the Dominican Republic and Haiti are closed. Military and police roadblocks are common in the border area. The roadblocks can appear to be unofficial, although the soldiers do wear army uniform and carry weapons.

There have been armed robberies on roads close to the border with Haiti, including by criminals posing as police officers.
