# Getting help

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) cannot provide tailored advice for individual trips. Read this travel advice and carry out your own research before deciding whether to travel.

## Emergency services in the Dominican Republic

Telephone: 911 (ambulance, fire, police)

The 911 emergency number does not have full coverage across the country. If you’re outside Santo Domingo, you can telephone the tourist police in an emergency: +1 809 200 3500.

## Contact your travel provider and insurer

Contact your travel provider and your insurer if you are involved in a serious incident or emergency abroad. They will tell you if they can help and what you need to do.

### Refunds and changes to travel

For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.
