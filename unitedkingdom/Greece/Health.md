# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

Dial 112 or 166 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Greece](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/91/greece#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See what [health risks you’ll face in Greece](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/91/greece).

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Greece. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

Pharmacies across Greece stock a good supply of medicines, but there are strict rules around dispensing certain medicines, including antibiotics. Bring prescription medicines with you and carry a letter from your doctor stating the quantity required during your stay. Keep the medication in the original container with the prescription label. The name on the prescription must match the name on your passport.

Prescriptions for uninsured individuals are only dispensed from:

* pharmacies at hospitals
* pharmacies registered with the National Organisations for the Provision of Health Services (EOPYY)

If you need to take controlled medicines in Greece, contact the [Organisation Against Drugs (OKANA)](https://www.okana.gr/el/information-english).

For more information, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines.

## Healthcare in Greece

Treatment and facilities are generally good on the mainland, but may be limited on the islands. The standards of nursing and aftercare, particularly in the state sector, is not to the usual standard of the UK. The public ambulance service is basic. There are serious shortages of ambulances on some islands.

If you are uninsured, you may not be able to get medical treatment or diagnostic tests from private doctors in Greece, only from public hospitals and primary healthcare centres.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Greece](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities) where some staff will speak English. On some Greek islands, local staff in bars or airports may direct you to private first aid or medical centres rather than to the public hospital.

There is also [information if you’re hospitalised in Greece](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-visitors-hospitalised-in-greece).

### Health insurance cards

To get medically necessary state healthcare in Greece, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

The NHS’s [getting healthcare abroad webpage](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/) has details about:

* how to apply for a GHIC
* how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
* who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
* what treatment counts as medically necessary

A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:

* changes to travel and accommodation bookings
* additional standard costs for treatment
* medical repatriation to the UK
* treatment that is ruled non-urgent
* private healthcare
* private clinics
