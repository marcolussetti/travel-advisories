# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Greece’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Greece set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Greek Embassy in the UK](https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/the-embassy).

## Passport validity requirements

Greece follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). Your passport must:

* have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
* have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

## Visa requirements

You can [travel without a visa to the Schengen area](https://www.gov.uk/travel-to-eu-schengen-area), which includes Greece, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training

The [requirements for working in Greece](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-greece-for-work) are different. If you are a touring creative, see [details about the Uniform (Schengen) visa](https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/visa.html?mission=lon).

If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.

Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.

If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.

If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.

You may also need to:

* show a return or onward ticket
* prove that you have enough money for your stay

### Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period

For a longer stay, you must [apply to the Greek authorities for a national visa](https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/visa.html?mission=lon).

If you’re in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.

## New Schengen entry requirements

The EU’s Entry/Exit System (EES) is expected to start in October 2025. It is not currently in operation. The European Union will inform about the specific start date of the EES before its launch.

## Vaccine requirements

For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccines, see [TravelHealthPro’s Greece guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/91/greece#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about [goods that can be brought into and taken out of Greece](https://www.aade.gr/en/customs). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

### Taking food into Greece

You cannot take [meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en). There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.

### Taking money into Greece

Declare cash or travellers cheques at your point of entry into Greece if you are carrying a value of 10,000 euros or more. You will be asked to complete the relevant declaration forms provided to you by the Customs Authorities. You should request a certified copy of the declaration to keep with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave. You can read further detail on the website of the Greek [Independent Authority for Public Revenue](https://www.aade.gr/en/greeks-abroad-non-residents/cash-reserves).
