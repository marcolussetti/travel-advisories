# Health

Before you travel check that:

* your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
* you have [appropriate travel insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

## Emergency medical number

There is no central public ambulance service. Some private providers operate in the main cities. In an emergency, call the nearest hospital. FCDO has a [list of some of the hospitals in Kathmandu and Pokhara](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nepal-list-of-doctors).

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

## Vaccine recommendations and health risks

At least 8 weeks before your trip:

* check the latest [vaccine recommendations for Nepal](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/159/nepal#Vaccine_Recommendations)
* see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the [NHS travel vaccinations page](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/)

See [what health risks you’ll face in Nepal,](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/159/nepal) including:

* dengue
* air pollution

Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Nepal, particularly in tourist and trekking areas. Read more about [altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/26/altitude-illness).

## Medication

The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Read [best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad).

## Healthcare in Nepal

Medical treatment is expensive at western travellers’ clinics in Nepal. Healthcare is poor in most places outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara. It may be difficult to get rapid helicopter evacuation if you fall ill or suffer a serious accident in a remote area of the country. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, repatriation and evacuation by helicopter. This usually costs between £1,000 and £2,000 or more per flying hour.

FCDO has a [list of medical providers in Kathmandu and Pokhara](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nepal-list-of-doctors) where some staff will speak English.

There is also [guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Nepal](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-nepal#healthcare-in-nepal).

## Travel and mental health

Read [FCDO guidance on travel and mental health](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues). There is also [mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions).
