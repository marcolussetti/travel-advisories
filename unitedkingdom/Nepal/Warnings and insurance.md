## Protests

Following protests and incidents of violence that led to a number of deaths and injuries in Kathmandu and elsewhere across the country, curfews have been introduced in several cities, including Kathmandu and Pokhara. Avoid protests, check local media for updates, and follow the directions of the authorities. See [‘civil disorder’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nepal/safety-and-security#civil-disorder).

Following a period of disruption Kathmandu airport re-opened on 10 September. Contact your airline, hotel and tour operator for up-to-date information and to confirm any flight arrangements or logistics to get to the airport before you attempt to travel.

The Government of Nepal has said travellers whose visas were valid until 8 September and were unable to depart Nepal, will be able to exit without being charged additional fees.

While the social media ban has been lifted, expect continued disruption to services, including internet and mobile data.
