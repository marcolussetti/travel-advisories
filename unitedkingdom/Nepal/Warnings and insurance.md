Latest update:
:   Information about the risks during Monsoon season, including flash flooding (‘Warnings and insurance’ page).

## Monsoon season

Travel during the monsoon season can be hazardous. Flooding (including flash flooding) and landslides cut off towns and villages for days at a time.

The Nepal government [Meteorological Forecasting Division](http://www.mfd.gov.np/) provides weather updates (in English) and flood forecasts during the monsoon. You can also access the [Department of Hydrology and Meteorology flood monitoring service](https://www.dhm.gov.np/hydrology/floodMonitoring).

See [Extreme weather and natural disasters](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nepal/safety-and-security#extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters).

## Protests

Most curfews introduced in several cities following violence and protests during week of 8 September 2025 have been lifted. This allows freedom of movement. Restrictions could however be reintroduced. Avoid any large crowds or protests, check local media for updates (including any new curfews) and follow the directions of the authorities. See [‘civil disorder’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nepal/safety-and-security#civil-disorder).

Following a period of disruption to airports, flights have resumed. Contact your airline, hotel and tour operator for up-to-date information before travelling.
