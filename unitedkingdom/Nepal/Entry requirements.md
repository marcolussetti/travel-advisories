# Entry requirements

This information is for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Nepal’s current rules for the most common types of travel.

The authorities in Nepal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [Nepal Embassy in the UK](https://uk.nepalembassy.gov.np/).

## Passport validity requirements

To avoid problems at immigration, make sure your passport has an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after your date of entry into Nepal.

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. [Renew your passport](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew) if you need to.

You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

### Checks at border control

At border control, you may need to show:

* a travel insurance document which has cover for healthcare costs including repatriation and other emergencies while you are in Nepal
* confirmation of where you will spend your first night, for example, a hotel booking

## Dual nationals

When returning to the UK, British citizens must carry a valid [British passport](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports) or [certificate of entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement). See [Dual citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship).

## Visa requirements

You must have a visa to visit Nepal for up to 90 days.

### Applying for a visa

You can [apply online for a visa on arrival](https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/) up to 15 days in advance of your arrival. Using your submission receipt, you then collect and pay for your visa at the airport. You can also apply using the forms or terminals available at the airport, then [queue up to get the visa](https://ntb.gov.np/plan-your-trip/before-you-come/tourist-visa). You can pay by card, but you should have cash as a back-up, with US dollars being the preferred currency.

Alternatively you can [apply for a tourist visa in advance](https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/onlinevisa-mission/application) and collect it from the Nepal Embassy in the UK or in another country. Applying in advance can reduce the time it takes to pass through immigration.

Visas are available for several lengths of stay at various costs. Look on the [immigration department website for the options](https://www.immigration.gov.np/).

You can [extend your visa online](https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/) to up to a total of 150 days in one year.

Overstaying your visa in Nepal is a serious crime and can lead to significant fines or imprisonment.

## Vaccine requirements

To enter Nepal, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had:

* a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a [country listed as a transmission risk](https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission)
* a polio vaccine, if you’re coming from certain countries with a transmission risk

For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see [TravelHealthPro’s Nepal guide](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/159/nepal#Vaccine_Recommendations).

## Customs rules

There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Nepal. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.

Bringing precious metals into Nepal is strictly regulated. You can carry gold ornaments up to 50 grams and silver ornaments up to 100 grams. If you bring in undeclared gold or silver, you may:

* get a fine equivalent to the value of the goods
* go to prison for between one month and 5 years depending upon the value of the goods
* have the goods confiscated
* be detained during the proceedings

### Taking money into and out of Nepal

You must declare on a customs form on arrival any amount above the value of 5,000 US dollars in banknotes or 10,000 dollars in notes and travellers cheques combined. Customs will give a certified declaration, which you must keep.

You will need to convert all your Nepali currency before you leave Nepal, and the bank or exchange counter at the airport may ask you for the declaration.

ATMs are not reliable outside main tourist sites.
