#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in South Sudan. For consular assistance, contact the Australian Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

The security situation and other factors mean the Australian Government's ability to provide consular services in South Sudan is extremely limited.
