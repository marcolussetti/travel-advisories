#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa requirements

If, despite our advice, you plan to travel to South Sudan, you need to get a visa issued in advance. You won't be allowed to enter the country without one. To get an [Department of e-Visa and Immigration Services.](https://evisa.gov.ss/)

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest South Sudanese embassy or consulate for details about visas, currency and customs.

#### Border measures

To enter South Sudan you may be required to show a copy of your COVID-19 vaccination certificate.

The airport at Juba and all land border points can close with little or no warning. Juba Airport is closed after dark.

Check with your security provider for up-to-date information and security assessments on entry points to South Sudan.

#### Other formalities

#### ID and travel documents

Ensure your ID and travel documents and those of your travelling family members are up to date and kept securely. This includes passports.

There may be significant delays in obtaining records locally, including certificates of birth, death or marriage. There are limited postal services and internet outside of Juba and limited courier services. Allow sufficient time when trying to obtain records locally or for processing travel documentation, including visas.

#### Ebola

Arriving travellers may be screened at Juba International Airport and some land entry points to South Sudan.

#### Dual Nationals

Border officials may scrutinise the travel documents of dual nationals. This may lead to delays at the airport. Previously, officials have stopped some dual nationals from leaving.

#### Passport

#### Validity

South Sudan requires you to have at least five blank pages in your passport on arrival.

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* in Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* if you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the South Sudanese Pound (SSP).

South Sudan is a cash-based society.

Credit and debit cards, traveller's cheques and cash cards are generally not accepted. ATMs are scarce and often unreliable.

You'll need to pay cash in local currency or US dollars dated 2017 onwards for all purchases, including hotel bills.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are a danger throughout South Sudan.

Use only main roads and paths marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

#### Road travel

Road travel is very dangerous due to poor road conditions and the security environment.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained vehicles
* poor street lighting
* unsealed and unmaintained roads
* pedestrians and animals wandering on or near roads
* overloaded and unpredictable movement of vehicles

Police presence on roadways outside major towns is limited. Traffic police are poorly trained.

Local drivers regularly ignore traffic signals, and traffic accidents are common.

Road conditions deteriorate during the wet season from July to November.

Highways and other roads may become impassable and some parts of the country can become inaccessible for months.

Roadblocks, official and unofficial armed checkpoints are common throughout South Sudan, including in Juba and especially after dark. Approach all vehicle checkpoints with caution.   
  
Diplomatic, UN and NGO drivers have been stopped and harassed at checkpoints.

There are regular reports of money being demanded from drivers and passengers at these checkpoints.

If despite our advice, you need to drive in South Sudan:

* check local security and road conditions
* seek local advice on possible routes
* seek professional security advice
* arrange personal security measures
* make contingency plans
