# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Armed conflict

We continue to advise do not travel to South Sudan. If you travel to South Sudan, despite our advice, be highly vigilant, monitor security developments closely and abide by any imposed curfews. You should also:

* ensure your travel documents and those of your travelling family members are up to date
* carry copies of your identification with you at all times, including to hand over to immigration or the police, if required
* seek professional security advice
* arrange personal security measures
* keep a low profile
* keep in contact with friends and family
* ensure you keep supplies of any medication you require, as well as food and water.

Since March 2025, there has been armed fighting between rival factions, including air strikes in some parts of South Sudan, resulting in casualties. Due to continuing tensions in the country, there is a heightened military presence in Juba and some parts of the country. Political tensions remain high, and the security situation could deteriorate quickly. 

Lack of law and order across the country is a serious threat, the security situation is volatile and could deteriorate with little warning, including in Juba. Thousands of people have been killed in South Sudan since violence began in December 2013. Intercommunal violence and fighting between armed groups continue across the country. Border areas are especially dangerous.

There's a serious risk of attacks on civilians. National or international events could prompt attacks on foreigners. Due to the extremely volatile security environment, South Sudan remains a dangerous operating environment for aid workers.

With little warning, local authorities can impose:

* curfews
* roadblocks
* other security measures

Juba airport may close or be inaccessible, flights could be suspended and routes in and out of the country may be closed with little or no warning. The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is highly dangerous.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To reduce your risks of being affected by demonstrations and protests, you should:

* avoid large crowds
* be aware of your surroundings
* maintain a low profile and do not record or photograph gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* carry certified copies of identification keep original documents in a secure location
* consider your personal security
* keep your cell phone charged
* monitor local media for safety and security risks and adjust your travel plans accordingly
* have a prepared plan for emergencies, including ensuring you have sufficient supplies of cash, water, food, medicines and fuel, as ongoing strikes may lead to supply shortages.

If civil unrest or conflict happens, shelter indoors and stay off the streets.

#### Terrorism

Attacks could occur anywhere at any time.

Security presence at official facilities is high. Terrorists may look for easier targets, such as housing compounds.

Terrorists may target places popular with travellers, including tourist areas, hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars. Airports, bus stations and other transport hubs are also possible targets.

Other possible targets include:

* foreign government, multinational corporations and international organisations' buildings
* oil installations
* public spaces including schools and marketplaces
* places of worship
* outdoor events

If despite our advice, you are in South Sudan, be alert to possible threats and report any suspicious behaviour or items to police.

Carefully plan your activities and reconsider travelling to places known to be terrorist targets.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* seek professional security advice
* monitor the media for new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so.

Stay away from affected areas due to the risk of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is widespread and can happen at any time of the day. Armed robbery, including ambush and roadside crime, is common.

Murder, shootings, home invasions, [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), carjacking and [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") are common throughout South Sudan, including in Juba.

Gun crime happens frequently and may include:

* compound invasions
* attacks on hotels and restaurants
* attacks on other places foreigners go

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common and can include:

* pickpocketing
* theft of items from vehicles
* fraudulent currency exchanges

Criminals are often armed and there's been an increase in the number of crimes involving guns.

There's no official government curfew in Juba but this can change at short notice. Most embassies and international organisations have a self-imposed curfew. The time varies depending on local events.

If, despite our advice, you travel to South Sudan:

* always travel with vehicle doors locked and windows up
* be on guard against carjacking
* be alert to threats when stopped in traffic
* secure your accommodation
* always be alert to your surroundings

#### HIV/AIDS

HIV/AIDS is common. If you're a victim of rape or violent crime, seek immediate medical assistance outside of South Sudan as availability of HIV prophylaxis and psychosocial support may be limited.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.   
   
Violent crime is widespread in South Sudan and kidnappings are common. Kidnappers mainly target journalists, aid workers and foreign nationals associated with infrastructure in remote and contested areas. The risk is elevated in proximity to the borders of Chad, Sudan and the DRC.    
   
If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.    
   
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Climate and natural disasters

South Sudan experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* flooding
* sandstorms
* drought
* dust storms

If, despite our advice, you travel to South Sudan and a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Severe weather

Flooding often occurs in South Sudan, particularly during the rainy season from July to November.

Floods can lead to shortages of drinking water and food. Transport and communication infrastructure can also be damaged.

You're still at risk of waterborne disease after the floodwaters recede.

Northern areas of South Sudan often experience high temperatures. During the hottest months of the year, the temperature can be higher than 50˚C.

Sandstorms, drought and dust storms can occur.
