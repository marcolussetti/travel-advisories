# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to South Sudan, including Juba, due to the dangerous security situation and the threat of violence and armed conflict. The security situation is volatile and could deteriorate rapidly with little or no warning. If you’re in South Sudan despite our advice, leave when it's safe to do so using commercial means while they’re still available. If the security situation deteriorates further, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked and you may be unable to leave for an extended period. Juba airport may close or be inaccessible. Plan sufficient travel time and check your flight status before leaving for the airport. If there's civil unrest or conflict, shelter indoors and stay off the streets. Our ability to provide consular services in South Sudan is extremely limited. The Australian Government may not be able to assist you to leave.

## Overview

### Safety

* If you’re in South Sudan despite our advice, leave when it's safe to do so using commercial means while they’re still available. The security situation is volatile and could deteriorate rapidly with little or no warning. If the security situation deteriorates further, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked and you may be unable to leave for an extended period. Juba airport may close or be inaccessible. Plan sufficient travel time and check your flight status before leaving for the airport. Our ability to provide consular services in South Sudan is extremely limited. The Australian Government may not be able to assist you to leave.
* If you choose not to leave, make sure to keep all travel documentation up to date for any emergency and be prepared to shelter in place. Be highly vigilant, monitor security developments closely and adhere to any road checkpoints and curfews.
* Make sure you have sufficient supplies including food, water and medicine to cover for an extended period of shelter in place.
* Since March 2025, there has been armed fighting between rival factions, including airstrikes in some parts of South Sudan. Due to continuing tensions, there is a heightened military presence in Juba.
* Many security checkpoints (legal or illegal) have been set up in Juba and throughout the country. Vehicles are regularly stopped and searched, sometimes resulting in violence.
* Reports of intercommunal violence are common. Border areas are especially dangerous.
* Terrorist attacks could occur without warning. Public places, hotels, restaurants and government buildings are targets. Airports and transport hubs may also be targets. Be alert in public places. Don't walk alone, especially after dark. Report any suspicious items or activity to the police.
* Kidnapping, murder, shootings, home invasions, armed robbery, carjacking and sexual assault are common throughout South Sudan, including in Juba. Petty crime, such as theft and fraudulent currency exchange, is common. Safeguard your belongings.
* If, despite our advice, you travel to South Sudan, get professional security advice, and adopt appropriate personal security measures.

### Health

* The risk of polio in South Sudan is high. Check your vaccinations are up to date at least 8 weeks before you travel.
* HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activity. According to the WHO, Monkeypox is endemic in South Sudan.
* Yellow fever is widespread, so get vaccinated before you travel. Malaria is common year-round. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue, filariasis and leishmaniasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases include typhoid, cholera and hepatitis. Since October 2024, South Sudan has been experiencing a cholera outbreak with a large number of cases. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water.
* Make sure you have enough medication with you, as the deteriorating security situation may lead to supply shortages.
* Medical facilities are basic in Juba and extremely limited elsewhere. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. This can cost thousands of US dollars.
* Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.
