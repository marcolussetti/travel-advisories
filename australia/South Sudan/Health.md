#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll need a specific insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for South Sudan.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Polio

The risk of [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) in South Sudan is high.

If you're unsure, check with your doctor at least 8 weeks before you travel.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are basic in Juba and extremely limited elsewhere.

Specialised doctors, surgeons and operating facilities are inadequate in Juba and don't exist elsewhere.

You'll need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to another country with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very difficult to arrange. Air ambulances aren't available at short notice. Juba airport is closed after dark.
