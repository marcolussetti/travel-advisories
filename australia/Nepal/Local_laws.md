# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

In tourist areas, it's common to be offered to buy drugs.

Penalties for drug offences are severe. Even if you're found with small quantities, authorities can convict and jail you.

#### Surrogacy laws

Commercial surrogacy has been illegal since 2015.

* [Going overseas to adopt a child](/before-you-go/activities/adoption "Going overseas to adopt a child")

#### Other laws

It's illegal to take photos or videos of:

* army barracks
* checkpoints
* military personnel.

It's illegal to convert people from their religion. Punishment can include jail.

If authorities suspect you're trying to convert people, you will likely be deported and banned from re-entering Nepal for years.

Same-sex relationships are legal and Nepali LGBTQIA+ people actively advocate for their rights. However, Nepal is a conservative and traditional society, and travellers have reported harassment and discrimination.

Avoid public displays of affection.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Nepal doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

Dress codes are relaxed in tourist areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara. Other parts of the country are more conservative.

Dress modestly to avoid offending locals. If in doubt, seek local advice.
