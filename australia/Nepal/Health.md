#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring any medication, check if it's legal in Nepal. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Air pollution

Air quality in Nepal varies, especially in winter. Some towns, including Kathmandu, experience high levels of seasonal smog and pollution.

Get medical advice if you're worried about air pollution.

#### Altitude sickness

If you travel to an area higher than 2,500m you might develop [altitude sickness](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/altitude-sickness).

Altitude sickness can be deadly. It can affect anyone, even if you're very physically fit.

Your risk of altitude sickness increases if you:

* ascend too quickly
* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before you can adjust to the altitude
* have health problems that affect your breathing.

If you'll be travelling above 2,500m, get advice from your doctor before you travel.

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in:

* the Terai (plains) and Hill districts
* Chitwan National Park.

Other insect-borne diseases are becoming more common, including in some areas of Kathmandu. These diseases include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you leave
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common.

Take precautions if engaging in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [swine flu (influenza A H1N1)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic))
* [bird flu (avian influenza)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic))
* [leptospirosis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/leptospirosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

Highly contagious eye problems, such as [conjunctivitis](https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/index.html), are common after the monsoon season.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals and birds.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

Animals may carry rabies in Nepal. If a stray dog, monkey or other mammal bites you:

* immediately wash the wound with soap and water
* get urgent medical treatment.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities and ambulances in Nepal are very limited, especially outside Kathmandu.

In Kathmandu, treatment at high-standard clinics is expensive. Up-front payment is usually needed.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure this is covered by your travel insurance.
