#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Nepal. Visas-on-arrival are available but travellers should check with the nearest Nepal Embassy for details and conditions.  
  
You need a valid visa in your passport to leave Nepal.

#### Maximum stays

Australians in Nepal may be able to extend their visas. Please consult Nepal's [Department of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.np/en/contact) for updates.

#### Expired visas

You must have a valid visa in your passport to leave Nepal.

If your visa has expired, extend it at the Department of Immigration before you leave.

If you overstay your visa, authorities can detain you until you pay a fine. The amount of the fine is based on the number of days you overstayed.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](http://au.nepalembassy.gov.np/contact/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Some of Nepal’s land border checkpoints are open to foreign nationals. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Nepal](http://au.nepalembassy.gov.np/contact/) for details.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If you get an emergency passport, you must also transfer your visa to your new passport before leaving Nepal.

To do this, present the following to the [Department of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.np/en/contact):

* a police report
* two current passport-sized photographs

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR).

Declare all amounts of cash over $US5,000 or equivalent on arrival and departure.

You can change foreign currency for NPR at banks or foreign exchange counters at the airport and in major tourist hubs. You cannot exchange NPR outside Nepal.

Credit cards are accepted at major hotels and commercial places.

ATMs are not common in remote places. Carry enough cash to cover your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Monsoon season

The monsoon season generally occurs from June to September but can be unpredictable.

Expect travel disruptions and be prepared to change your plans.

Road travel can be dangerous, especially in the low-lying Terai (plains), where the risk of flooding is higher.

Landslides are common in mountainous areas, including the Kathmandu valley.

Airports may close. Air travel disruptions are common.

Monitor[Nepal weather information](http://www.mfd.gov.np/)for up-to-date information on conditions. Contact your travel provider about possible disruptions to your travel plans.

#### Travel from Nepal to India

Some of Nepal’s land border checkpoints are open to foreign nationals. For information on the entry requirements for India please refer to the Smartraveller India specific travel advice.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of India](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/91) for up-to-date information.

#### Travel from Nepal to Tibet

Generally, only travellers in organised tour groups get visas and permits for the Tibetan region of China.

If you're planning to travel to Tibet:

* check the [travel advice for China](/destinations/asia/china "China")
* contact an [embassy or consulate of the People's Republic of China](http://au.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/sgxx_0/lxwm_133259/202308/t20230824_11131326.htm)

If you're in Nepal, contact the [Embassy of the People's Republic of China](http://np.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/lxwm/) in Kathmandu.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Nepal, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

Your travel and vehicle insurance could be void if you drive without an IDP.

If you stay for longer than six months, you need a Nepali driver's licence.

The minimum driving age is 18 years.

#### Road travel

Driving in Nepal can be dangerous due to:

* crowded and poorly maintained roads
* poor driving standards
* drivers who often ignore traffic laws

Road travel is more dangerous at night, especially in rural areas.

Landslides and flooding can damage or block rural roads. This is common during the monsoon season from June to September. Towns or areas are often cut off for days at a time.

Landslides and other disruptions can occur on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway, a section of the road between Kathmandu and Chitwan National Park, and the Prithvi Highway, the road between Kathmandu and Pokhara.

Road travel can be disrupted due to:

* demonstrations and strikes
* roadworks and infrastructure projects.

Significant delays on major roads within cities and towns, as well as on highways, are common.

Open drains and uncovered manholes are a risk to pedestrians and cyclists.

Locals often assume foreigners are at fault in car accidents, regardless of the situation. They may demand money. Crowds of onlookers can gather quickly after an accident and may turn hostile.

Car accidents resulting in injuries often lead to confrontations and road closures. Violence against drivers also happens.

If you plan to drive in Nepal:

* learn local traffic laws and practices
* monitor the media for road closures
* always keep your car windows up and doors locked
* avoid travel between cities after dark.

If you're involved in a traffic accident and are worried about your safety:

* stay in your locked vehicle
* phone 103 for the Traffic Police
* wait for the police.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet. Helmets bought in Nepal may not meet Australian safety standards.

#### Taxis

Taxis are often unmetered and drivers may overcharge travellers. Negotiate a fare with the driver before the trip.

Use online ride hailing taxi services such as Pathao or inDrive for travel in Kathmandu valley.

#### Public transport

Travel on public buses and vans is dangerous. These vehicles are overcrowded and poorly maintained.

There are frequent accidents with multiple deaths involving intercity buses.

Accidents involving private hire cars and jeeps travelling between cities regularly occur and can cause injuries or death. If you are concerned, ask your driver to slow down and drive safely.

Women may be harassed, including sexually, on public buses.

#### Air travel

Kathmandu airport is operating at partially reduced hours due to construction activities. International and domestic flights could be disrupted and delayed. Before travelling, contact your tour operator or airline for updates.

In normal circumstances, cancellations and delays are common, especially during:

* tourist seasons when the airport is crowded
* bad weather (especially throughout the monsoon season).

Check weather conditions before travelling. Bad weather conditions in mountainous and hill regions could further increase the risk to your safety and cause lengthy delays. Airfields such as Lukla's, in the Solukhumbu (Everest) region, are among the most remote and difficult to land on. These airfields are challenging for even the most technically proficient pilots and well-maintained aircraft.

All carriers from Nepal have been [refused permission](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-safety-list_en) to operate air services to the EU due to safety concerns.

There have been several air accidents in Nepal over the last 10 years, including:

* July 2024 - a Saurya Airlines flight crashed on take-off from Kathmandu. 18 of the 19 people on board were killed.
* January 2023 - a Yeti Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara with 72 people on board crashed shortly before landing. All 68 passengers and four crew were killed.
* May 2022 - a Tara Air flight from Pokhara to Jomsom with 22 people on board crashed shortly after take-off in bad weather. All 16 passengers and six crew were killed.
