## Overview

### Safety

* Travellers have been victims of armed robberies and assaults, including sexual assaults. Drink spiking often occurs before a sexual assault. Never accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers. Don't leave your food or drinks unattended. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Nepal experiences earthquakes, landslides, floods and severe weather. Be prepared for a major emergency. Keep an emergency kit that includes first aid supplies and bottled water. Ensure you know where your travel documents are, including your passport. Widespread flooding can disrupt transportation and services. If you're in affected areas, check the media for updates and follow the instructions of local authorities.
* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. An attack could happen anywhere and at any time.
* Political protests are common, and general strikes occasionally occur. Strikes can disrupt essential services. Don't visit government buildings during political unrest. Reconsider the need to use a vehicle during strikes, as it may be a target. Don't participate in public protests, as it would breach your visa conditions, and you could be arrested and deported.
* A small number of incidents involving low-yield Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) occur, often associated with political events, such as election periods. In November 2022, there were several small-scale explosions in Nepal. Physical confrontations between rival political organisations can also occur.
* Pickpocketing and petty theft are common. Bag-snatching and 'snatch-and-grab' attacks by thieves on motorbikes occur. Keep your belongings close. Don't travel alone; females are at a higher risk of assault.

### Health

* Altitude sickness is a risk above 2,500m. It can be life-threatening. It can affect anyone, even people who are physically fit. Ensure your travel insurance covers medical evacuation from altitude. Some towns, including Kathmandu, have high levels of seasonal smog and pollution. Get medical advice if you have breathing difficulties.
* Malaria is a risk in the Terai (plains) and Hill districts and Chitwan National Park. Consider taking anti-malarial medicine for these areas. Other mosquito-borne diseases are becoming more common, including in Kathmandu. These include dengue and Japanese encephalitis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.
* Rabies is common. It's fatal without immediate treatment. Avoid dogs, monkeys and other mammals. Get medical help straight away if an animal bites or scratches you.
* HIV/AIDS is common. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include typhoid, cholera and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities in Nepal are very limited, especially outside Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, treatment at high-standard clinics is expensive. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. You may be offered illegal drugs in tourist areas. Penalties for drug offences are severe, including for possessing small amounts.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph army barracks, checkpoints and military personnel.
* Don't participate in public protests as it would breach your visa conditions, and you would be arrested and deported.
* It's illegal to convert people from their religion. Punishment can include jail. If you're suspected of trying to convert people, you will likely be deported and banned from re-entering Nepal.
* Same-sex relations are legal. However, society is conservative. LGBTQIA+ travellers have reported harassment and discrimination. Avoid public displays of affection.
* Nepal doesn't recognise dual nationality. Always travel on your Australian passport.

### Travel

* You need a visa to enter Nepal. Visas-on-arrival are available, but you should check with the nearest Nepal Embassy for details and conditions.
* Kathmandu airport is operating at partially reduced hours. International and domestic flights could be disrupted and delayed. Before travelling, contact your tour operator or airline for updates.
* Nepal is issuing trekking and mountaineering permits, but you should check with your intended tour provider about the 2025 spring season.
* The local currency is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). Exchange foreign currency for NPR at banks and exchange bureaus in major centres. Major hotels and commercial centres accept credit cards. ATMs are uncommon in remote areas. Carry enough cash to cover your needs.
* Only use registered taxis and authorised limousines. Taxi drivers often refuse to use meters and overcharge travellers. Negotiate the fare with the driver before you go. Avoid public buses and vans. They're overcrowded and poorly maintained. Intercity buses often have serious accidents. Women may be harassed on public buses.
