# Safety

#### Civic unrest and political tension

A small number of incidents involving Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have occurred, often associated with political events, such as election periods. These attacks have caused deaths and serious injuries. Physical confrontations between rival political organisations can also occur.

These incidents usually don't target travellers, but you could get caught up in violence aimed at others.

Threats have been made against religious organisations in Nepal. This includes schools.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Calls for political protests, strikes and demonstrations sometimes are common. Violent clashes between protesters and authorities can occur. Avoid visiting government buildings during political unrest.

During strikes, authorities may enforce curfews at short notice in the areas that protests affect. This happens throughout Nepal.

Illegal roadblocks and enforced national or local strikes can occur. These happen without notice and continue for long periods.

Road travel can be dangerous. Protesters may forcibly stop vehicles, including taxis, or target them with projectiles.

Travel services may also be affected. This includes travel to trekking areas and outside of the Kathmandu valley.

To reduce your risks during strikes or other periods of unrest:

* be alert
* limit your movements and don't go out unless you have to
* avoid areas affected by demonstrations, protests and other public gatherings
* monitor the media for new threats, especially when political tensions are high
* obey curfews
* follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing and petty theft are common, especially:

* at tourist sites and airports
* on buses
* from hotel rooms

Bag-snatching and 'snatch-and-grab' attacks by thieves riding motorcycles occur. Victims are often injured.

Police have increased their presence in Thamel and Durbar Marg to reduce crime in these areas.

To reduce your risk of petty crime:

* only carry a copy of the main pages of your passport, not the original
* walk on footpaths away from the curb, with your bag held on the opposite side to the traffic
* keep your personal belongings close, especially in crowded areas
* avoid travelling alone, especially if you're a woman
* never trek alone
* If you're the victim of fraud or a scam, report it to local police immediately.

#### Violent crime

Travellers have been victims of [armed robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and assaults, including [sexual assaults](/consular-services/resources/sexual-assault-overseas-factsheet "Fact sheet: Sexual assault overseas").

Victims of sexual assault often have their drinks 'spiked' before the assault. This happens in popular areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara.

Women are at particular risk, especially when alone and at night.

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* never accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers
* don't leave drinks unattended
* if you aren't sure if a drink is safe, leave it
* stick with people you trust when you're out

Get urgent medical help if you think you or a companion have had your drinks spiked.

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.  See our advice on [Partying safely](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

**More information:**

* [Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Victims of sexual assault often have their drinks 'spiked' before the assault. This happens in popular areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara.

Women are at particular risk, especially when alone and at night.

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* never accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers
* don't leave drinks unattended
* if you aren't sure if a drink is safe, leave it
* stick with people you trust when you're out

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Get urgent medical help if you think you or a companion have had your drinks spiked.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as trekking, paragliding, rafting or kayaking.

Paragliding accidents have caused serious injuries and deaths. Rivers can be unpredictable and dangerous, even for experienced kayakers and rafters.

Mountaineering can be dangerous. Some mountaineering expedition companies may hire inexperienced guides and save on other costs in order to offer cheaper prices, including to climb Mount Everest. Carefully check a company's credentials and experience before you book.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if it's covered by your travel insurance policy
* ensure that the activity provider meets appropriate safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Trekking and mountaineering

With conditions, foreign tourists are permitted to enter Nepal for mountain trekking and mountaineering. All foreigners require a permit for trekking and mountaineering. Solo foreign trekkers are required to have a licenced trekking guide. Trekking is managed through the Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) by:

* [Trekking Agency Association of Nepal](http://www.taan.org.np/) (TAAN)
* [Nepal Tourism Board (NTB)](https://www.tourismdepartment.gov.np/)

All foreign trekkers must have a valid TIMS card. This includes those not travelling with organised groups.

TIMS cards help authorities locate trekkers in case there's an emergency.

Get a TIMS card through:

* authorised trekking companies
* TAAN offices in Kathmandu or Pokhara
* the NTB office in Kathmandu

Special regulations apply to mountaineering expeditions. All expedition members must have permits.

Get a licenced trekking guide through authorised trekking companies.

#### Trekking risks

Some trekking companies or guides may offer condensed treks. This is to attract travellers with limited time or budgets.

Shorter treks may not give you enough time to get used to high altitude. This may cause excessive physical strain and lead to significant health problems or death. See [Health](#health).

Make sure you have travel and medical insurance that covers:

* the altitude you'll reach
* altitude sickness
* emergency evacuation by helicopter or other means

See [Health](#health).

Research regulations that apply to trekking in the area, such as permits or registration. Confirm requirements through:

* reputable companies in Nepal or Australia
* an [embassy or consulate of Nepal](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/141)

Find out how long you need to safely complete your trek, especially at high altitudes.

A trek to Everest Base Camp should take at least 12 days from Lukla. This is the start and end points of treks in the Everest region.

Hire a trekking company with a good reputation and professional guides.

Don't trek alone. Solo foreign trekkers are required to have a licensed trekking guide.

Before you travel, check:

* the security situation
* route conditions
* likely weather in the area

Be ready to change your plans.

For more information on trail conditions, check the [Himalayan Rescue Association](http://www.himalayanrescue.org/).

Let family or friends know about your plans. Tell them how long your trek will take and your route.

#### Medical evacuation

Sometimes trekkers are pressured into taking expensive helicopter evacuations. This can happen at the first mild signs of ill health, without having had a proper medical consultation.

In such cases, insurance companies have previously declined to pay for the evacuation. The trekker must then pay the cost.

Some people have reported cases of dishonest trekking guides deliberately serving contaminated food or water. The aim was to make travellers sick to justify their evacuation.

Individuals who arrange helicopter evacuations sometimes falsely claim to have checked with a trekker's insurance company.

Some travellers have been encouraged to provide false or misleading information to insurance companies about an evacuation.

If you become ill while trekking, confirm if your insurance covers evacuation costs. Do this yourself, if possible, before you agree to a helicopter evacuation.

#### Telecommunications

Telecommunications facilities are limited and can be unreliable, especially outside major cities and towns.

Mobile phone coverage doesn't exist in many rural and remote areas.

#### Essential supplies

Electricity supplies can be unreliable, including in Kathmandu. Unreliability increases during winter and in the lead up to the monsoon season.

Shortages of essential supplies can happen with limited notice. Essential supplies include:

* food
* water
* fuel
* gas
* kerosene.

Shortages can affect businesses, including hotels and guesthouses.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Nepal experiences [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"), landslides, floods and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

Major [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") can lead to:

* injuries and deaths
* disruptions to transport and essential services
* damage to infrastructure
* food shortages
* health issues.

Be prepared for a major emergency. Keep an emergency kit that includes:

* first aid supplies
* water treatment tablets or stocks of bottled water.

Know where your travel documents are kept, including your passport.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family
* avoid unnecessary travel to affected regions.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Earthquakes

Nepal is in an active earthquake zone. Earthquakes and tremors are common and can cause further damage to already weakened structures.

#### Landslides, floods and avalanches

Landslides and floods resulting in deaths occur regularly in Nepal. This happens especially during the monsoon season, from June to September.

Major roads and all trekking areas can be affected.

Avalanches can happen at any time of year.

#### Severe weather

Storms and blizzards can occur with little or no warning, especially in the Himalayas.
