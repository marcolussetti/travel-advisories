# Safety

#### Crime

Crime levels in the Seychelles are low. But petty crime occurs. This includes:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* theft
* street robbery near ATMs

[Theft and robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) generally occur in tourist locations, for example, Victoria and Beau Vallon on Mahé and Cote D'Or beach on Praslin Island.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be aware of your surroundings and alert to suspicious behaviour
* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked, with no valuables on display
* avoid going alone at sea or on hikes and inform your family or friends before you head out.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Swimming safety

The Seychelles can experience strong ocean currents and rips. This includes the popular Beau Vallon beach which can have dangerous currents when the sea is rough.

Currents can change throughout the day and at different times of year.  

There's usually no safety information displayed at beaches and not many lifeguards present.

To protect yourself at the beach:

* get local advice before swimming
* do not fish, swim, or snorkel alone
* be alert to changes in sea conditions, including rips.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities like diving and swimming with dolphins.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if the activity is covered by your travel insurance
* use only registered operators that have been issued with a valid permit
* ask about, and insist on, minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts.

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
