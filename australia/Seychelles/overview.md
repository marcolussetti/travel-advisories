## Overview

### Safety

* Seychelles can experience severe weather, especially during the northwest monsoon season (December to March).
* Crime levels are low, but petty crimes occur. The risk of theft is higher in tourist hubs, such as Beau Vallon and the capital, Victoria. Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables out of sight. Avoid back streets and beaches after dark.
* Beaches in the Seychelles, including Beau Vallon, often have strong currents and rips. There's usually no safety information displayed at beaches and not many lifeguards on duty. Get local advice before swimming.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, occur. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* You may be at risk for preventable diseases. Consult with your local health care professional for advice on current risks and vaccine options. Take care with personal, food and water hygiene.
* Medical facilities in the Seychelles are limited, especially on the remote islands, and can be expensive. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers hospital stays and evacuation.
