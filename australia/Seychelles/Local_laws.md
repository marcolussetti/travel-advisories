# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Check local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Drug use, possession and trafficking are serious offences in the Seychelles. Punishments can be severe and may include fines and prison sentences up to life imprisonment.

Seychellois are generally very conservative. They don't tolerate topless sunbathing or nudism on public beaches. 

Same-sex relationships are legal in the Seychelles but some LGBTQIA+ travellers have reported discrimination.

All travellers, regardless of gender or sexuality, should avoid public displays of affection.
