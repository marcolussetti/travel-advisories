#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You don't need a visa to enter the Seychelles as a tourist but must apply for an online [Digital Travel Authorisation](https://seychelles.govtas.com/en) before you go. You'll have to pay a fee and upload the required documents. It may take up to 24 hours to receive approval.

On arrival, you'll receive a visitor's permit. This may be granted for a period of up to three months. It can be extended for successive periods not exceeding three months at a time to a maximum period of 12 months. You may need to show evidence of funds, accommodation, onward travel, and travel insurance.

If you're taking cash with a value of 50,000 Seychellois rupees or more into Seychelles, you should declare this when you apply for your travel authorisation.

For arrivals by sea, visit the [Seychelles Immigration & Civil Status Office website](http://www.ics.gov.sc/visa-and-travel/visiting-yacht).

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

If you're coming from a country that has yellow fever, you'll need a valid yellow fever international vaccination certificate to enter the Seychelles. You don't require this if you're transiting through an airport of a yellow fever endemic region for less than 12 hours.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of the Seychelles is the Seychellois Rupee (SCR).

ATMs are available at the airport and major tourist destinations but can be difficult to find in remote areas. ATMs only dispense SCR.

Most hotel and tourist services accept debit and credit cards, but you should check with your hotel or guesthouse if you will be able to pay using your card. Some guesthouses and hotels may accept euros or US dollars.

You can change money at:

* banks
* the international airport
* licensed operators
* hotels and resorts.

Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work in the Seychelles.

#### Local travel

**Driving permit**

The minimum driving age in the Seychelles is 18 years for private cars and 16 years for motorcycles.

You can drive with either a valid Australian driver's licence or an International Driving Permit (IDP). You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

**Road travel**

You can only drive on the islands of Mahé and Praslin. Roads on both islands can be narrow and winding with sheer drops, sharp bends and limited safety barriers. Sudden heavy rain can reduce visibility.

Common hazards include:

* poor road conditions, including potholes
* erratic driver behaviour, including drink-driving.

If you plan on driving in the Seychelles:

* check local traffic laws and practices
* be aware of potential dangers on the roads
* drive carefully and legally
* don't drink and drive
* avoid remote roads, particularly at night
* check your travel insurance policy covers you in case of an accident.

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your travel insurance policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines, preferably arranged through your hotel.

Taxis aren't usually metered. Research what taxi fares to expect on trips and agree the fare with the driver before you leave.

#### Public transport

Buses on Mahé operate from early morning to early evening. Services are limited on some routes and schedules can be unreliable.

#### Boat travel

Boat travel may be dangerous.

Ferries and rivercraft may be overloaded, poorly maintained and lack life-saving equipment. A lack of navigation skills and unexpected storms can also contribute to boating accidents.

To stay safe on the water:

* check safety standards are in place
* check there is enough safety equipment for everyone
* wear your life jacket
* avoid travelling after dark
* don't get on overcrowded boats

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) can occur in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Seychelles. Reduce the risk of piracy by adjusting your route if required and monitoring piracy reports from the [International Maritime Bureau](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).
