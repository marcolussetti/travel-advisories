#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away, including during stopovers on the way to and from your destination.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Australia on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the Seychelles. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medications are
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Outbreaks of [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) and [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya) occur in the Seychelles.

To protect yourself from insect-borne disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in the Seychelles are limited, especially on the remote islands where doctors are often not available.

The island of Mahé has several clinics and a state-run hospital. The Victoria hospital can deal with accidents and emergencies.

There are two decompression chambers on Mahé: one in Victoria Hospital (Victoria) and one in the Seychelles Family Hospital (De Quincy).

There's no healthcare agreement between Australia and the Seychelles. Tourists must pay for treatment.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Make sure your travel insurance includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.
