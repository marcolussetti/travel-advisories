#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Nicaragua has a high risk of crime. This includes:

* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* express [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping), where criminals force you to withdraw cash from an ATM
* [theft](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [carjacking](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)

Highest rates of violent crime occur in:

* Managua
* Granada and San Juan del Sur
* Bonanza
* La Rosita Siuna
* Corn Island

Gang violence can happen at major hotels, bus terminals, beaches and markets.

Illegal drug smuggling occurs in the Caribbean coastal area.

Policing is limited outside major urban areas. You may not find police in:

* remote beach communities on the Pacific Coast
* Atlantic Coast autonomous regions

Drug traffickers and other criminals use these areas.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Incidents of kidnapping occur in Nicaragua. Small criminal gangs motivated by financial gain are responsible for the vast majority of kidnaps. Express kidnappings are a problem.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Taxis

Assaults and robberies occur in unlicensed taxis or when a stranger offers to call a taxi for you. To reduce your risks:

* don't use a taxi if a stranger organised it
* use official taxis with a clearly visible red number plate
* use radio-dispatched taxis at the international airport and larger hotels

Take note of the taxi's registration and phone numbers.

While it is a common local practice to share taxis with strangers, we recommend you don't. If you must, agree on a fare for a solo journey before you set off.

There is a risk of ‘express kidnapping’ if you use an unauthorised taxi. You could be taken hostage and forced to pay cash for your release.

#### Road-based crime

Armed gangs carry out kidnappings, robberies and extortion in the northern border region.

For safer travel to the Honduran border, only use highways that cross the border at:

* Guasaule
* El Espino
* Las Manos

Criminals have attacked vehicles, including hotel-run buses, along:

* Managua to León highway (Route 12/CA-3)
* Tipitapa to Masaya highway (NIC-11A)
* Somotillo to Chinandega highway (NIC-24)

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't discuss your travel plans with strangers or in public
* don't travel at night
* only travel in tourist areas
* avoid isolated locations
* avoid walking alone, particularly on remote beaches

Avoid public transport. If you must use it, be cautious of anyone offering help. They may rob you.

#### Petty Crime

Pickpockets and bag snatchers are a risk:

* on public transport
* in tourist areas
* at hotels and markets
* when your vehicle is stopped in traffic

Take care of your valuables:

* in markets near the old cathedral in Managua
* near the Tica Bus Station terminal
* at public transport terminals

Use reputable tour operators. Thieves posing as tour guides may rob you, particularly on the island of Ometepe.

Only use ATMs at banks and in busy areas, like shopping centres.

Be alert when using your credit card. Credit card fraud is on the increase.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Many criminals carry weapons.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests against the Nicaraguan Government may occur.

Take care not to appear to support anti-government activity. Authorities may arrest or imprison you.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

During periods of unrest:

* avoid protests as they may turn violent
* monitor local media reports of unrest
* don't cross roadblocks
* follow the advice of local authorities

Boundary disputes occur in the Caribbean coastal waters between Nicaragua and Honduras. Authorities have detained and impounded boats and fishing vessels.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Strong currents and undertows occur on the Pacific coast beaches. Check the safety conditions. There may not be lifeguards or warning signs.
