#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Nicaragua has a high risk of crime. This includes:

* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* express [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping), where criminals force you to withdraw cash from an ATM
* [theft](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [carjacking](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)

Highest rates of violent crime occur in:

* Managua
* Granada and San Juan del Sur
* Bonanza
* La Rosita Siuna
* Corn Island

Gang violence can happen at major hotels, bus terminals, beaches and markets.

Illegal drug smuggling occurs in the Caribbean coastal area.

Policing is limited outside major urban areas. You may not find police in:

* remote beach communities on the Pacific Coast
* Atlantic Coast autonomous regions

Drug traffickers and other criminals use these areas.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Incidents of kidnapping occur in Nicaragua. Small criminal gangs motivated by financial gain are responsible for the vast majority of kidnaps.

Express kidnappings are a risk, including through unauthorised taxis, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms or force you to withdraw cash from an ATM.  

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Scams and Fraud

Scams and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards:

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Nicaragua. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

Some individuals specialise in deceiving tourists, often presenting as friendly English speakers. They may offer tour guide services or assistance purchasing items and resorting to violence to achieve their objectives. Only use reputable tour operators and registered taxis.

#### Road-based crime

Border and remote areas have higher risks of violent crime due to drug smuggling. Only use official border crossings. Cross during daytime. 

Criminals have attacked vehicles, including hotel-run buses, along:

* Managua to León highway (Route 12/CA-3)
* Tipitapa to Masaya highway (NIC-11A)
* Somotillo to Chinandega highway (NIC-24)

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't discuss your travel plans with strangers or in public
* don't travel at night
* only travel in tourist areas
* avoid isolated locations
* avoid walking alone, particularly on remote beaches

Avoid public transport. If you must use it, be cautious of anyone offering help. They may rob you.

#### Petty Crime

Pickpockets and bag snatchers are a risk:

* on public transport
* in tourist areas
* at hotels and markets
* when your vehicle is stopped in traffic

Take care of your valuables:

* in markets near the old cathedral in Managua
* near the Tica Bus Station terminal
* at public transport terminals

Use reputable tour operators. Thieves posing as tour guides may rob you, particularly on the island of Ometepe.

Only use ATMs at banks and in busy areas, like shopping centres.

Be alert when using your credit card. Credit card fraud is on the increase.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Many criminals carry weapons.

#### Food and drink spiking

Be cautious about snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes as they may contain drugs, putting you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests against the Nicaraguan Government may occur.

Take care not to appear to support anti-government activity. Authorities may arrest or imprison you.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

During periods of unrest:

* avoid protests as they may turn violent
* monitor local media reports of unrest
* don't cross roadblocks
* follow the advice of local authorities

Boundary disputes occur in the Caribbean coastal waters between Nicaragua and Honduras. Authorities have detained and impounded boats and fishing vessels.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Volcanoes

Nicaragua has 3 active volcanoes:

* Santiago Volcano, about 25km south of Managua
* San Cristobal Volcano

After a volcanic eruption, falling ash can spread over a wide area. Ash, dust and toxic fumes are a significant health risk. If you have a respiratory condition, take particular care.

To protect yourself if there's a volcanic eruption:

* stay inside with the windows and doors shut
* place damp towels under doors and windows if ash is falling
* monitor advice and alerts from authorities

If you go outside, wear a disposable face mask, goggles and long clothing to avoid contact with ash.

To reduce your risks if you climb a volcano:

* only climb with a group
* use experienced guides and a reputable tour company
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
