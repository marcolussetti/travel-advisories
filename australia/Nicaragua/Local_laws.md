# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal but aren't always accepted. Avoid public displays of affection.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to take photos of official buildings. Check with local authorities before taking photos.

There are strict restrictions on the use of drones. Do not use drones for photography or any other reason unless you have written permission from Nicaraguan authorities.

If you drive a car and injure or kill someone in an accident, authorities may arrest or detain you. The local courts will need to determine who was responsible. This can take weeks or months.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Dual nationality is recognised in Nicaragua. Should you be arrested, you may be treated only as a Nicaraguan citizen and denied access to consular services.

Children with single or dual Nicaraguan nationality may need specific documents to leave the country without both parents.

Contact the Nicaraguan authorities before you travel.
