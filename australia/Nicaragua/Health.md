#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Nicaragua. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in rural areas of Nicaragua, including the outskirts of Managua.

[Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) and [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya) are widespread.

The risk of other insect-borne diseases increases in the rainy season, from April to November. This includes:

* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [Leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

Widespread transmission of [zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) occurs in Nicaragua.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

To protect yourself from diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common.

These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Facilities are good in Managua but are very limited in smaller towns and rural areas.

Expect to pay cash upfront before doctors, and private hospitals treat you, even in an emergency.

There are no emergency ambulance services in Nicaragua. Access to certain types of medical equipment, medication and treatments is limited.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need evacuation to another country. This can be very expensive.
