## Overview

### Safety

* Nicaragua has a high crime rate, including armed robbery, assault and express kidnapping. There aren't many police outside major urban areas. Avoid remote locations. Don't go out alone or at night. Only travel to tourist areas. Violent crime occurs in unofficial taxis. Use only official taxis with a red number plate, or radio-dispatched taxis. Avoid public transport.
* Borders and remote areas have higher risks of violent crime due to drug smuggling. Only use official border crossings. Cross during daytime.
* Hurricane season is from June to November. Hurricanes can cause flooding and disrupt services. Know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plan. Find your nearest shelter.
* Nicaragua has 3 active volcanoes. Don't hike near volcanoes or visit remote areas without an experienced guide.
* Protests against the Nicaraguan Government may occur. Take care not to appear to support anti-government activity. Avoid protests and political gatherings, authorities may arrest or imprison you.

### Health

* Malaria is a risk in rural areas, including the outskirts of Managua. Consider taking anti-malaria medication.
* Insect-borne diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, chagas disease and leishmaniasis, are widespread. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Zika virus is also widespread. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include tuberculosis, typhoid, hepatitis and rabies. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get immediate medical help.
* Medical facilities are good in Managua but very limited elsewhere. There are no emergency ambulance services. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation out of the country. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
