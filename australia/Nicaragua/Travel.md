#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Tourist card (CA-4 visa)

You'll need to purchase a tourist card at the airport. This permits you to visit Nicaragua for up to 90 days.

Nicaragua is a member country of the Central American Border Control Agreement (CA-4), along with:

* [El Salvador](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/el-salvador)
* [Guatemala](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/guatemala)
* [Honduras](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/honduras)

With a CA-4 tourist visa, you can travel freely by land between member countries within a 90-day period.

Your tourist card is dated from the first point of entry in any member country.

You can apply to extend the CA-4 visa at [Nicaraguan Immigration (Spanish)](https://www.migob.gob.ni/migracion/) before it expires.

If you overstay the visa without an extension, you may be:

* fined
* forced to leave
* unable to enter other CA-4 member countries

If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Nicaraguan Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/146) in Japan for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're [travelling through the US](/destinations/americas/united-states-america "United States of America"), ensure you meet all current US entry and transit requirements. If you're arriving in or transiting through the US, you'll need to show onward flight tickets from not only the US but also any country that borders the US (i.e. Mexico and Canada) if that's your next destination.

#### Travel via Canada

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Nicaragua. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Arrival and departure taxes

There's an arrival tax, which you need to pay in cash.

Your airline ticket usually includes the airport departure tax from the Augusto Sandino Airport in Managua. Confirm this with your travel agent.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who want to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Nicaraguan Córdoba (NIO).

You won't be able to use Australian dollars or traveller's cheques in Nicaragua.

The only foreign currency you can exchange is US dollars.

ATMs have low daily withdrawal limits.

#### Local travel

#### Remote areas

If you're an adventure traveller, use an experienced local guide. This includes trekking to volcanoes or other remote areas.

Make sure you take enough supplies.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Nicaragua, you'll need either:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get the IDP before arriving in Nicaragua.

You also need to carry your current passport and tourist card.

#### Road travel

Driving in Nicaragua can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* narrow roads in poor condition
* lack of signage
* dangerous local driving practices

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Nicaragua than in Australia.

If you're involved in an accident, don't move your vehicle until a police officer permits it.

If you plan to drive or travel by car:

* only travel during daylight hours
* travel in groups where possible
* don't hitchhike
* lock doors and keep windows up, even when moving
* don't leave main roads in the northern border region, as there are unmarked landmines

#### Taxis

It's a common local practice to share taxis with strangers. To avoid this, agree on a fare for a solo journey before you set off.

Assaults and robberies happen in unlicensed taxis or when a stranger offers to call a taxi for you. Don't take a taxi if you don't know the person who called it.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Nicaragua's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YN) with the Aviation Safety Network.
