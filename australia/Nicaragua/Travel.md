#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Tourist card (CA-4 visa)

You'll need to purchase a tourist card at the airport. This permits you to visit Nicaragua for up to 90 days.

Nicaragua is a member country of the Central American Border Control Agreement (CA-4), along with:

* [El Salvador](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/el-salvador)
* [Guatemala](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/guatemala)
* [Honduras](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/honduras)

With a CA-4 tourist visa, you can travel freely by land between member countries within a 90-day period.

Your tourist card is dated from the first point of entry in any member country.

You can apply to extend the CA-4 visa at [Nicaraguan Immigration (Spanish)](https://www.migob.gob.ni/migracion/) before it expires.

If you overstay the visa without an extension, you may be:

* fined
* forced to leave
* unable to enter other CA-4 member countries

If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Nicaraguan Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/146) in Seoul for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

To enter the country, you'll need:

* a valid passport
* a return or onward ticket
* evidence you have enough money for your visit

You'll need to pay an airport tax on arrival at the airport.

Your airline ticket usually includes the airport departure tax from the Augusto Sandino Airport in Managua. Confirm this with your travel agent. 

#### Travel via the United States

If you're [travelling through the US](/destinations/americas/united-states-america "United States of America"), ensure you meet all current US entry and transit requirements. If you're arriving in or transiting through the US, you'll need to show onward flight tickets from not only the US but also any country that borders the US (i.e. Mexico and Canada) if that's your next destination.

#### Travel via Canada

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Nicaragua. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who want to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Nicaraguan Córdoba (NIO).

You can only exchange US dollars in Nicaragua.

ATMs aren't always reliable. Credit cards are widely accepted.

Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work.

Using ATMs on the street puts you at high risk of [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) or express kidnapping.

#### Local travel

#### Remote areas

If you're an adventure traveller, use an experienced local guide. This includes trekking to volcanoes or other remote areas.

Make sure you take enough supplies.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Nicaragua, you'll need either:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get the IDP before arriving in Nicaragua.

You also need to carry your current passport and tourist card.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Nicaragua than in Australia.

Driving in Nicaragua can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* aggressive local drivers
* poorly maintained vehicles
* roads in poor condition
* drivers ignoring traffic laws
* In rural areas, extra road travel risks include:
* poor lighting and street signs
* people and animals on roads

If you're involved in an accident, don't move your vehicle until a police officer permits it.

If you plan to drive in Nicaragua:

* check your travel insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* don't travel alone, at night or through dangerous areas
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* don't drink or use drugs

#### Taxis

Travelling by taxi can be dangerous.

Book airport taxis and regular taxis through a reputable taxi company. These are safer than taxis flagged from the street or at taxi stands.

If you use a taxi:

* arrange transport through your hotel or a radio dispatcher to avoid unlicensed operators
* buy vouchers from the airport Tourist Office for airport taxis
* book in advance if travelling at night
* don’t let your driver pick up other passengers
* never share a taxi with a stranger
* agree on the fare before you set off
* note your taxi driver’s name and licence number

#### Landmines

There are unmarked mine fields on both sides of the Honduras-Nicaragua border, especially in:

* the Rio Coco region
* the area near the Atlantic Coast

Don't leave known safe roads and areas.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Nicaragua's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YN) with the Aviation Safety Network.
