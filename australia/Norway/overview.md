## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather.
* The Government of Norway lowered its national terror threat level from 'High' to 'Moderate' (level 3 of 5) on 14 November 2024 after temporarily raising it in October 2024. Norwegian authorities said there was still a heightened threat from extremists against Jewish and Israeli targets in Norway.  Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Norwegian authorities recommend that residents remain prepared for unexpected emergencies by maintaining a one-week supply of food, bottled water, and essential items.
* Norway has a low level of crime. However, sexual assaults against foreigners and violent, gang-related crimes have occurred.
* There's a risk of petty crime, particularly in and around Oslo. The risk rises during the peak tourist season from May to September. Thieves often work together and use tricks to distract travellers. Be careful in airports, train stations, Oslo's main shopping streets, hotel lobbies and restaurants.
* Avalanches and rockslides can happen in some mountain areas. Extreme weather, floods and landslides can also occur. Check advice on weather and safety conditions before skiing or mountaineering.
* The northernmost parts of Norway are in the Arctic Circle. Be careful in these areas. Polar bears have killed travellers in Svalbard. Follow instructions from local authorities. If you're travelling by ship, check the onboard medical care.

### Health

* Hospitals in cities offer a high standard of care. Many medical staff speak English. However, services are limited in rural and remote areas.
* You may need to be evacuated if you need treatment in remote areas. Make sure you have appropriate travel insurance.
* Australia has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Norway. You can access immediate emergency medical services. You still need private travel health insurance.

### Local laws

* Penalties for drug offences include heavy fines and imprisonment.
* If you assault someone, however minor, you may face jail.
* The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0.02%. There are frequent roadside checks for drink driving.
* Norway allows dual citizenship. If you hold Norwegian citizenship, you may be required to do national service if you're aged between 19 and 44.
* Seek appropriate registration for drones and [check if drone flying is permitted](https://luftfartstilsynet.no/en/drones/no-drone-zones/) in the area before taking off. Officials have seized drones, and tourists have been arrested for operating drones.

### Travel

* Norway is part of the Schengen area, meaning you can enter without a visa in some cases. In other situations, you'll need to get a visa.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Norway for the latest details.
