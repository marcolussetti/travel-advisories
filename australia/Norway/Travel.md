#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

Norway is part of the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/424), along with many other European countries. You may be able to enter Norway without a tourist visa. In other situations, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Norway](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/151) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Travel via Svalbard

The Norwegian territory of Svalbard isn't part of the Schengen area.

If you're travelling to Svalbard, you'll need a valid passport to enter.

You must meet [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/424) entry requirements when returning to Norway's mainland.

Medical facilities in Svalbard are limited. You may require medical evacuation for treatment.

#### Other formalities

Norway has border controls at:

* ferry crossings from Sweden, Denmark and Germany
* at the land border between Norway and Sweden, Finland and Russia.

Always carry your passport to enter and exit, even if you're travelling within the Schengen area.

Border controls between Norway and Russia have been tightened. You should only approach the border along the road leading to the [Storskog border](https://www.politiet.no/en/english/the-norwegian-russian-border/) crossing station.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports. 

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to 

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines can be inconsistent in applying the rule. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Border crossings

Always carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the Schengen area.

Get an entry stamp in your passport from border control staff when you first enter the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/424).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Currency

Norway's official currency is the Norwegian Kroner (NOK). Norway won't accept the Euro in most situations.

You can bring up to the equivalent of 25,000 NOK in cash into Norway.

You need to pay a customs toll and a fine if you arrive with more than 25,000 NOK.

**More information:**

* [Directorate of Norwegian Customs](http://www.toll.no/en/goods/currency/)

#### Access to money

Norway accepts some foreign debit and credit cards in some outlets. These may incur a surcharge fee.

Credit card transactions usually need a credit card with a microchip and PIN, not a signature.

There are limited ATMs in most rural areas in Norway.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

Australian driving licences are valid in Norway for up to 3 months. To drive a vehicle, you'll need a current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted). However, some car rental companies may require customers to present an International Driving Permit (IDP) regardless.

You can check if your licence will be accepted in Norway, as well as the minimum driving age, here: [Driving licence holders | Statens vegvesen](https://www.vegvesen.no/en/driving-licences/driving-licence-holders/)

If you need an IDP, get this before you leave Australia. An IDP does not replace the requirement for a regular driver's licence.

If your driving licence is not written in Latin letters or doesn't include your licence number, a photograph or an issuing date, you'll need an IDP to drive in Norway.

#### Road travel

Speed limits are low. Roads can be dangerous in winter due to ice. The weather can change quickly, and snow can block rural roads. Plan ahead.

Rural roads are usually 2 lanes and can be narrow and winding in mountainous regions. Take particular care when driving outside urban areas. Check signs for animal crossings, such as moose or deer crossings.

The northern lights can distract drivers, making them lose control or stop without warning, creating a hazard for other road users.

By law, when driving, headlights must be on at all times, and it's illegal to use your mobile phone. Authorities impose heavy fines for speeding and strictly enforce drink driving laws.

Norway has tyre requirements that change with the seasons. Ensure your tyres are appropriate for the weather and road surface conditions. Check official information here: [Tyre requirements | Statens vegvesen](https://www.vegvesen.no/en/vehicles/own-and-maintain/tyre-requirements/)

Road rules and conditions are available at the [Norwegian Public Road Administration](https://www.vegvesen.no/en/).
