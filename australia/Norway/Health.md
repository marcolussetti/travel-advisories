#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Australia has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Norway. You can access immediate emergency medical services. You still need comprehensive travel insurance.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers.
* your insurance covers helicopter rescue and medical evacuation if you are traveling to remote areas.
* your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, [check if it's legal in Norway](https://www.toll.no/en/goods/medicines-and-supplements/travelling-with-medicines/). Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

For advice on restrictions on imports, visit the [Norwegian Customs website](https://www.toll.no/en/about-norwegian-customs).

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

#### Health risks

Health risks in Norway are broadly similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

Hospitals in cities offer a high standard of care. Many medical staff speak English.

Australia has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Norway. You can access immediate emergency medical services.

The agreement won't cover ongoing treatment of existing health conditions. You still need private travel health insurance.

Services are limited in rural and remote areas, including Svalbard.

If you need treatment in the remote area of northern Norway or Svalbard, medical teams may evacuate you for medical care. This will take time. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and is not covered by the reciprocal health agreement.
