# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you break the law in Norway, you may be banned from the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") for up to 10 years or permanently.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, even for possession of small amounts of recreational drugs or some prescription medications, include:

* heavy fines
* imprisonment
* being removed from the Schengen area.

#### Drones

You must be appropriately [registered](https://flydrone.no/register) in an EU country to operate a drone in Norway. Civil Aviation Authority Norway provides guidance on registering and operating [drones](https://luftfartstilsynet.no/en/drones/) in Norway.

Drones are strictly controlled in the polar regions, including air, ground and water drones.

Penalties for operating a drone without appropriate approvals or in restricted locations can include:

* heavy fines
* confiscation of the drone
* you may face jail or deportation
* you may be banned from the Schengen area

#### Other laws

Always carry an ID, such as your driver's licence or a copy of your passport.

If you assault someone in any way, you may be jailed.

Alcohol laws are very strict, and penalties for driving under the influence are severe. The legal limit is 0.02% blood alcohol and applies to the driver of any motorised vehicle. There are frequent roadside drink driving checks.

If you speed or drive under the influence:

* penalties are severe
* you may face jail or deportation
* you may be banned from the Schengen area.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
