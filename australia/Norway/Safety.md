#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Europe.

Terrorists have attacked some European cities in recent years. Targets have included:

* public transport
* other transport hubs
* cultural venues and markets
* public places frequented by locals and foreigners.

The Government of Norway lowered its national terror threat level from 'High' to 'Moderate' (level 3 of 5) on 14 November 2024 after temporarily raising it in October 2024. Norwegian authorities said both extreme Islamists and right-wing extremists still threaten Jewish and Israeli targets in Norway.  

In June 2022, a gunman shot at people in 3 venues in Oslo. 3 people were killed, and several others were injured.

To reduce your risk of terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report suspect actions or items to police
* monitor the media for threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities.

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Serious crime is rare.

There have been some [sexual assaults](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") against foreigners. 

Violent crime with weapons has occurred in areas where criminal gangs operate, such as parts of eastern Oslo.

#### Petty crime

Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing, cons and bag-snatching, are increasingly common. The risk rises during the peak tourist season from May to September, particularly in Oslo.

Thieves often work together and use various tricks to distract travellers.

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare.

Check the media and avoid possible unrest.

If there's a protest near you, follow the advice of local authorities.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Tours and Adventure travel

There are many adventure activities in Norway. These include mountaineering, trekking, skiing and glacier climbing.

Check you have everything you need for these activities, including the right equipment.

Ensure you're fit enough to do these activities.

To stay safe:

* follow local advice
* stay on marked runs and paths
* only ski in recommended areas
* check weather forecasts
* always let people know where you're going

The weather can be unpredictable, even during the summer months. Avalanches and accidents on glaciers and boats have also killed travellers.

Check your travel insurance covers these activities. Include coverage for helicopter rescue and medical evacuation.

If you're travelling to Svalbard, follow local safety advice.

Polar bears have killed and injured travellers in Svalbard.

#### Tour operators

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Arctic travel

The northernmost parts of Norway are above the Arctic Circle. The Arctic is a vast region. Take care in these areas.

If you're planning to visit:

* work out how far you'll be from search and rescue, evacuation and medical facilities
* make contingency plans
* be ready to change your plans if you need to
* follow the advice from local authorities

If you're travelling by ship:

* check the onboard medical care
* ask cruise operators about medical arrangements
* discuss any pre-existing medical conditions.

Search and rescue services may take a long time to arrive. They could be many hundreds of kilometres away. Stranded vessels may wait several days for help, particularly in bad weather.

We may not be able to give you full or prompt consular assistance in remote areas. 

To reduce your risks, have travel insurance or funds to cover:

* the cost of search and rescue
* any medical treatment
* your return home or to another city or country.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Norway experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), such as:

* avalanches and rockslides in some mountain areas
* flooding
* landslides

Check advice on weather and safety conditions before skiing or mountaineering.
