#### Surrogacy

Georgia has announced it intends to ban surrogacy for foreigners. The ban was due to start on 1 January, but the bill is currently still before the Georgian parliament. Contravening this law would be a criminal offence. ​It's unclear what transitional arrangements would be in place if the bill passes. 

Babies born through illegal arrangements may be prevented from leaving Georgia. Be aware that you may not be able to get your money back if you enter into a contract for surrogacy services. 

Before you commit to a surrogacy arrangement, seek independent legal advice from a Georgian solicitor with knowledge of this area of law. See our advice on [going overseas for international surrogacy](/before-you-go/activities/surrogacy "Going overseas for international surrogacy").

To bring children born through surrogacy to Australia, you must apply for an Australian passport. Check the website of [the Australian Embassy in Türkiye](https://turkey.embassy.gov.au/anka/Surrogacy.html) for details on how to apply. 

If you're going to Georgia for surrogacy, before leaving Australia, get prepared:

* Australians often find surrogacy in Georgia to be an extremely stressful experience.
* Tell us about your travel - [passports.complexcases@dfat.gov.au](mailto:passports.complexcases@dfat.gov.au)
* The entire process will likely take longer than you think. Plan for delays.
* Prepare your documents. Ensure you understand which documents you'll need and in what form (do they need to be apostilled, translated, or notarised?). Third-country documents (e.g. if your marriage certificate is not from Australia) may be scrutinised closely by the Georgian authorities and may cause delays.
* Understand what to expect from your surrogacy agency. Couples often experience a lack of information or sympathy from their surrogacy agency. Realise your agency will be managing multiple births at the same time as yours.
* Understand your surrogacy contracts, including contracted timeframes. Be cautious of verbal agreements from your surrogacy agency that differ from your contract documents. Have funds set aside for legal costs should a dispute arise.
* You'll need to travel to an Australian Embassy to obtain a passport for your child. Your child must stay in Georgia until you return to Georgia with the passport.
* Don't book return tickets before you have your child's passport. When to travel from Georgia to an Australian mission for a passport is your decision. We can't guarantee when a passport will be issued.
* Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Georgia. Consular services in Georgia are limited. Obtaining a birth certificate, citizenship, and passport takes time. Processing times vary.
* Children born through surrogacy can experience medical complications. Medical complications could extend your stay in Georgia and the costs of surrogacy. Medical evacuation is your responsibility.
* Don't expect special treatment from Georgian authorities. Georgian authorities will issue a birth certificate according to their requirements and timelines; they will not expedite your application simply because you need to leave Georgia. The embassy can't intervene with Georgian authorities on your behalf.
* Be prepared to change your plans. Due to Georgian authorities ' requirements, you may need to travel unexpectedly to Tbilisi.
* Due to language difficulties, you may find it frustrating to engage with medical and hospital staff.
* You may meet other clients undertaking surrogacy in Georgia. Every case is different. Don't compare how long it takes for others to leave Georgia. Be cautious about taking advice from other surrogacy clients; only seek advice from official sources.

It's your choice to travel to Georgia for surrogacy, and you're responsible for your safety, the safety of your child, and any legal or medical risks.
