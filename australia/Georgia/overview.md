## Overview

### Safety

* Political rallies are common in Georgia, including Tbilisi. They can turn violent. There have been political demonstrations since the Parliamentary elections in October. Monitor the media. Avoid public protests and demonstrations.
* Don't travel to South Ossetia or Abkhazia. There's a high risk of terrorist attacks, unexploded landmines and violence in these regions. We can't provide consular help to Australians who are there.
* Violent crime can occur. Financial, import and export scams also happen. Be wary of strangers. Be extra careful when walking after dark.
* Earthquakes and floods can happen in Georgia. Monitor the media. Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Waterborne, foodborne, and other infectious diseases occur. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Avoid ice cubes, unpasteurised dairy products, and raw and undercooked food.
* Medical care is limited and of poor quality. If you become ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* In June 2023, the Georgian government announced its intent to ban surrogacy for foreigners. The ban was due to start on 1 January 2024, but the bill is currently still before the Georgian parliament.
* Babies born through illegal arrangements may be prevented from leaving. If you plan to engage in surrogacy in Georgia, be aware of all the risks. Get legal advice from a Georgian solicitor with knowledge of this area of law.
* Always carry your passport, visa or migration card (or copies).
* Taking photos near military or strategic sites, such as airports, is illegal. It's also illegal to export items of national heritage without a licence.
* Georgia doesn't always recognise dual nationality. If you're a dual national, get advice from an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/74) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/74/State) of Georgia before you travel.
