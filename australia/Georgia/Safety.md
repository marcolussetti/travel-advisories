#### Civil unrest and political tension

There have been political demonstrations since the Parliamentary elections in October.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Political rallies are common in Georgia, including Tbilisi.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid public protests and rallies
* monitor local media and other sources for possible threats
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Conflict zones

South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the surrounding areas are unsafe. Unexploded landmines exist in these areas.

Violence and fighting between the military and, militia and criminals, including terrorists, is common.

Some roads in the Abkhazia region may have landmines.

We can't provide consular assistance to Australians in Abkhazia or South Ossetia.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Since 2008, car bombings have occurred in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This started when the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation ended.

Attacks target military and security sites, but civilians have been hurt.

Recent terrorist targets include:

* markets
* public transport
* commercial and public places where foreigners might be present

To reduce your risk:

* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for new threats
* listen to official warnings
* follow the advice of local authorities

Be alert in public places, especially around known terrorist targets, including:

* shopping areas
* places of worship
* sporting venues
* public transport
* airports and other transport hubs
* places of mass gathering

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the area in case of secondary attacks.
