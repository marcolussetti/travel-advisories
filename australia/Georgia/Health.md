#### Travel insurance

Ensure you get comprehensive travel insurance before you leave, as you may be asked to provide evidence at check-in or by the immigration authorities on arrival in Georgia.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you travel to South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite our advice, you'll need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to these areas.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication you can buy over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Georgia has a very strict anti-drug policy. There are legal limits on how much you can take into Georgia for some medications. If you travel without the required permits, you may be detained at the border and face heavy fines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medication, you'll need to contact the Embassy of Georgia.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Georgia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, and other infectious diseases occur. These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Sometimes serious outbreaks occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid unpasteurised dairy products
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs, cats and other animals

Get medical attention straight away if an animal scratches or bites you

Get medical advice if you think you have food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical care in Georgia can be limited, particularly outside Tbilisi.

International medical supplies are available, but the quality of services and facilities is poor.

If you become ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
