# Travel

#### Visas

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You can visit Georgia for up to 12 months without a visa if you have an Australian passport. You'll need a visa for longer stays.

Entry and exit requirements can change at short notice. Contact the [Georgian Foreign Ministry](https://mfa.gov.ge/en) or an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/74) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/74/State) of Georgia for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Travelling with children

[Children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") under 18 years travelling alone or with one parent may need a letter of consent from the non-travelling parent or parents.

They'll also need a copy of their birth certificate and passport.

Check requirements with an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/74) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/74/State) of Georgia.

#### Borders

We advise against all travel to the North Caucasus region of Russia due to the high threat of terrorist activity. See our [travel advice for Russia](/destinations/europe/russia "Russia").

It's illegal to enter Georgia via Abkhazia or South Ossetia, where there's no official border control.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Lari (GEL).

When entering or leaving, you must declare any foreign currency worth $US10,000 or more. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

By law, all goods and services must be paid for in GEL.

Credit cards are widely used in Tbilisi, but less so in regional areas.

ATMs are available in major towns.

Traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted.

#### Local travel

#### Abkhazia and South Ossetia

Do not travel to South Ossetia or Abkhazia and nearby areas. There's a risk of terrorist and criminal activity.

Unexploded weapons are in these areas.

We can't help Australians who are in these regions.

#### Driver's licence

You need an Australian driver's licence to drive in Georgia.

You may need an International Driving Permit (IDP) for insurance.

Before you drive in Georgia, check with your insurance and vehicle providers on what you need to do.

#### Vehicle insurance

Civil liability insurance is compulsory for vehicles registered outside Georgia.

You can buy insurance from centres at most border crossings.
