#### Travel insurance

Do not travel without comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance).

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Laos. See the [Ministry of Health](http://www.fdd.gov.la/content_en.php?contID=26) for information. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

The standard of medical facilities is generally poor, with hospital facilities outside of Vientiane extremely limited in their capabilities. Medical evacuation to another country can be difficult. Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in southern provinces. Take precautions.

[Dengue fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) is endemic throughout the country and year-round. Outbreaks are common in the rainy season (May to November). There's no vaccination or specific treatment for dengue.

Other insect-borne diseases are common, especially during the rainy season. These include:

* [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis)

Get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.

If you're pregnant, discuss any travel plans with your doctor. Avoid non-essential travel to areas with Zika virus.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking anti-malaria medicine

Get medical advice if you develop a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

If you engage in high-risk activities, you risk catching [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids). High-risk activities include unprotected sex and injecting drugs.

Take precautions during activities that may expose you to the virus. HIV/AIDS is more common in Laos than in Australia.

#### Rabies

Dogs throughout Laos carry [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies).

Rabies is a deadly virus that passes to humans from mammals, such as:

* dogs
* monkeys
* cats
* rats
* bats

Rabies is fatal if you don't get vaccinated or don't get medical treatment quickly.

Take care when dealing with any animal in Laos.

If an animal bites or scratches you:

* wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water right away
* get urgent medical help

#### Bird flu (avian influenza)

Human cases of [avian influenza](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-any-risks-of-bird-flu-in-australia) have been confirmed.

To reduce your risk of infection:

* avoid contact with infected birds, including at live bird markets
* wash your hands after handling uncooked poultry and eggs
* cook poultry and eggs thoroughly before eating

#### Anthrax

There's been outbreaks of anthrax in Southern Laos (Champasak province). Avoid dead animals or carcasses. Purchase meat from reputable sources, and do not eat raw or undercooked meat. Avoid animal products that could have been sourced from animals that may have died of natural causes. If you suspect that you may have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, food-borne and other infectious diseases are common. They include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19 )

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled or bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water

Get medical advice if you develop a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are generally basic in Laos. Hospitals don't provide meals for patients.

Many doctors and hospitals require a cash payment before providing services, even for emergency care.

Avoid local provincial medical facilities if you can. Travel to medical services in Vientiane or Thailand instead.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to seek evacuation to another country, such as Thailand. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
