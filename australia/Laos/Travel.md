#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You can, for a fee, obtain visas-on-arrival and e-visas.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Laos](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/109) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

**More information:**

* [Department of Immigration of Laos](http://immigration.gov.la/)

#### Departing Laos

To depart Laos, you must have a valid entry stamp and be within your authorised stay period or have an exit visa. Otherwise, you will be fined and may be arrested.

If your return journey to Australia transits another country, you should check Smartraveller and your airline for advice on transiting.

#### Other formalities

Only use official border crossing points to enter Laos.

Make sure you get an entry stamp on arrival. If you don't, authorities could fine or detain you.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If your passport is lost or stolen in Laos, you also need to:

* get a police report from the nearest police station
* show the police report to the [Department of Immigration of Laos](http://immigration.gov.la/) in Vientiane to get a Certificate of Loss
* get a replacement passport at the Australian Embassy in Vientiane
* get an exit visa from the [Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mofa.gov.la/) in Vientiane (which can take 5 working days). Prepare a Certificate of Loss and a copy of your new passport bio-data page when submitting an exit visa application.

If you don't take all these steps, immigration authorities could fine or detain you.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Road travel

Road travel in Laos can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* local driving practices and drink driving
* livestock on roads
* a lack of road lighting

The number of road accidents and deaths has increased in recent years. Accidents at night and those involving motorcycles are common.

Police often check drivers in towns and in rural areas. If you don't provide identification (ID) when asked, police could fine or detain you.

Before driving:

* check your travel insurance policy covers you
* learn about local traffic laws and practices

While you're on the road:

* always carry photo ID
* drive carefully and legally
* don't drink and drive
* take only well-used, well-lit roads

* obey curfews

Avoid driving at night if you can, especially on rural roads.

#### Motorcycles

Traffic in Laos does not operate on the same rules as Australia. It may appear chaotic and unpredictable. Riding motorcycles is one of the riskiest activities for travellers. Always wear a helmet and sensible clothing. Never ride or drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

If you plan to ride a motorcycle:

* check your travel insurance policy covers motorcycle
* use a well-known hire company with a good reputation
* check the rental contract to make sure the vehicle is insured for damage and theft
* don't provide your passport as a deposit or guarantee
* take date-stamped photos of your vehicle before you hire it to record any existing damage

Always wear a helmet. See [Safety](#safety)

#### Taxis

There are few taxis in Laos. Where possible, use official taxis or reputable ride-sharing companies that can be booked by phone, app or at major hotels or inside airports. Don't share taxis with strangers.

Be alert to possible scams and safety risks. Riding in tuktuks (motorised 3-wheel vehicles) or on motorcycle 'taxis' brings extra safety and security risks.

Make sure you agree on both the fare and route before taking:

* an unmetered taxi
* a tuktuk
* a motorcycle taxi

Secure your belongings while travelling in tuktuks or on motorcycles.

#### Public transport

Local vehicles and roads don't always meet Australian safety standards. Serious accidents do happen.

Inter-city bus networks are the main public transport option in Laos. However, the service isn't reliable in some parts of the country.

#### Travelling alone

If you're travelling on your own and not part of a tour group, find out about travelling to specific areas. Provincial or district offices can provide this advice.

If you want to [camp](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"), get permission from local authorities in advance.

Authorities may set and strictly enforce curfews in some provinces. Contact provincial or district authorities about where and when curfews are in place.

Follow instructions of local authorities. If you don't, they could fine, arrest or detain you.
