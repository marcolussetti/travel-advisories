# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty.

#### Surrogacy and adoption

If you're visiting Laos for paid surrogacy or adoption, get legal advice first.

* [Going overseas to adopt a child](/before-you-go/activities/adoption "Going overseas to adopt a child")

#### Intimate relationships

Intimate relationships between Lao citizens and foreigners who are not married are illegal. This includes sexual relationships and living together.

Marriages between Lao citizens and foreigners must be pre-approved by Lao authorities. This is the case if you are in Laos or another country.

Marriage certificates issued outside of Laos need to be checked by a Lao embassy. This needs to happen in the country where the marriage took place.

If you don't register a relationship, authorities could fine you or send you to prison.

#### Other laws

The death penalty can result from serious crimes such as:

* rape
* murder
* drug possession
* treason

Activities that are illegal in Laos include:

* taking photos of or visiting military sites
* making false statements to police
* wildlife trafficking
* damaging public property
* nudity in public or religious places

It's also illegal to:

* preach religion, including passing out religious material, without permission
* visit temples or other religious or cultural sites after 10:30pm
* speak or publish material against Laos

While cigarettes are common, the use of e-cigarettes (vapes), heated tobacco products and shisha is illegal in Laos. You could be fined or imprisoned for importing, exporting, selling, purchasing, or using these items. Do not bring these items into Laos.

It's also illegal to sleep or camp in:

* public spaces
* areas along riverbanks
* near forests

#### Curfews

In some areas night-time curfews apply after certain hours. Pay close attention to your personal security at all times and follow the instructions from security forces.

Curfews may be enforced with short notice or without notice and can include roadblocks, spot roadside checks and occasional raids on premises.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Laos doesn't recognise dual nationality. If you're a dual citizen, this may limit the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
