#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Lao authorities issued an order prohibiting the sale and consumption of Tiger Vodka and Tiger Whisky due to their concerns about these products being a health risk. Australians should avoid consuming these products due to these serious safety concerns. Several foreign nationals, including Australians, were victims in November 2024 of methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Travellers have died from drug-related incidents in Laos.

Some food and drinks sold in popular tourist spots may contain harmful and unknown substances.

Travellers have been assaulted after accepting spiked food or drinks.

To protect yourself against spiking:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* never leave food or drinks unattended
* if you're not sure if something is safe to eat or drink, leave it
* if you're drinking alcohol, stick with people you trust
* look out for the people you're with

If you think your drink or a friend's drink has been spiked, get urgent medical attention.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fwhile-youre-away%2Fwhen-things-go-wrong%2Fmedical-assistance&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C25c9589c64144803480108dd0aafaa56%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638678471776584911%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xw9WtxTrUmhCl5I4NdI7kV6jUPng0WrP%2FEE4j6VwDV0%3D&reserved=0) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Crime

Violent opportunistic crime such as [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") occurs in Laos, including in:

* Vientiane
* Vang Vieng
* Luang Prabang
* Bokeo Province along the border with Myanmar, Thailand and around the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ).

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, especially in tourist areas. It may include:

* thieves on motorbikes snatching bags
* theft from guesthouses

In the lead-up to local festivals, there's an increase in theft and violent crime. This includes Lao New Year in April.

Thieves often operate in pairs, with one person creating a distraction while the other steals unguarded items.

Thieves sometimes target foreigners in rural and remote locations, especially along:

* Route 6 (near the town of Sam Neua, Huaphan Province)
* Route 7 (Phou Khoun to Phonsavanh)

To protect yourself against petty crime:

* carry only what you need — leave valuables in a safe location
* don't place bags or valuables in the basket of your bicycle or motorbike
* be aware of pickpockets in tourist areas and crowds

#### Violent crime

Local media has reported violent muggings involving guns and knives in Vientiane.

Gun ownership is illegal. However, illegal guns are sometimes used, causing deaths and injuries.

The region east of Vang Vieng in Xaisomboun province has historically seen several shooting incidents and explosions. This has led to multiple deaths and injuries, including among civilians.

To protect yourself against violent crime:

* be aware of how much alcohol you consume
* be conscious of your surroundings
* pay attention to your personal security, especially at night and when riding a bike or motorbike
* be alert to people trying to distract you

When you're out at night:

* stick to well-lit public areas, especially in tourist cities and towns
* avoid travelling alone
* use well-travelled, well-lit roads
* be alert to crime along rural roads, especially Routes 6 and 7

#### Sexual assault

Travellers have been sexually assaulted, including in Vientiane, Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang.

Learn about [reducing the risk](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") of sexual assault overseas before you travel. Know what help is available to victims.

HIV/AIDS is more common in Laos than in Australia. If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get immediate medical help. Contact the Australian Embassy in Vientiane as soon as possible. See [Local contacts](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/laos#local-contacts).

#### Scams and fraud

Australians have reported hire companies demanding high payments for existing damage to motorbikes.

Hire companies sometimes arrange for motorbikes to be stolen from the renter. The renter is forced to pay thousands of dollars to compensate. This can amount to the value of a new motorbike plus lost earnings.

To avoid these scams:

* use a well-known vehicle hire company
* take date-stamped photos of your vehicle before you hire it to record any existing damage
* don't provide your passport as a deposit or guarantee for hiring a motorbike

ATM and credit card fraud are also common. To protect yourself against this kind of fraud:

* check for skimming machines before using ATMs
* take care not to expose your PIN
* keep your credit card in sight at all times, including during transactions
* monitor your bank statements

#### Employment Scams

Employment scams have occurred in Bokeo Province along the border with Myanmar, Thailand and around the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ).

Before signing an employment contract for work, verify the true nature of the work you're offered.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Officials have raised security levels, including an increased military presence at checkpoints on the Lao/Thai border in Bokeo province following ongoing clashes between the Lao army and unidentified armed groups. Monitor the local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

One-off incidents of civil unrest, including armed attacks and bombings, have occurred in the past in Laos. Foreigners, including Australians, are not often targeted.

Curfews may be enforced and can include:

* roadblocks
* spot roadside checks
* raids on premises

Always follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests and demonstrations are illegal in Laos. Avoid any protests, demonstrations or political activities that happen.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Terrorism

There's a low threat of terrorism in Laos. However, terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Laos experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

The rainy season is normally from May to November, bringing:

* tropical storms
* [typhoons](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident")
* flooding
* landslides
* high winds

The [Mekong River Commission](http://www.mrcmekong.org/) website has news on flood levels for the Mekong River.

[Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and tremors have happened in the border areas of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"):

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* keep in contact with friends and family
* monitor the media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* check with tour operators before going to affected areas

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes activities such as river tubing, zip lining, bungee jumping and riding in fast boats.

'Fast boat' river travel, in particular, can be dangerous due to:

* excessive speed
* natural hazards
* poor maintenance of equipment

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check weather conditions, river levels and other factors that may affect safety
* cancel or change your plans if it seems unsafe
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts
* do not mix alcohol and adventure activities, especially water-based activities.

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Vang Vieng river activities

At Vang Vieng, Australians have been injured or killed while:

* tubing
* jumping into the river
* diving into shallow water

River levels can vary during the year.

Take care when diving or jumping into the river. Debris can make it very dangerous. Do not consume excessive alcohol at riverside bars while river tubing. Australians have died doing this.

#### Unexploded weapons

Unexploded remnants of war are still found in many parts of Laos, particularly in:

* Xieng Khouang province (near the Plain of Jars)
* the Lao–Vietnamese border areas along the Ho Chi Minh Trail

Affected areas are often unmarked.

To stay safe:

* never stray from established walking paths and roads
* don't touch or pick up unknown metal objects
