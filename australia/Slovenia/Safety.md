# Safety

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Slovenia, they can still happen.

Terrorists have staged attacks in European cities in recent years. Targets include:

* airports
* public transport, including train stations
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* public areas that attract large groups of people, such as tourist attractions, music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, Christmas markets, sporting venues and shopping centres

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* take care near places known to be possible terrorist targets
* report suspicious behaviour or unattended items to the police
* monitor the media for updates
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can occur at nightclubs, often leading to [sexual assault](/node/355). 

Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* don't accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended
* stick with people you trust in bars and nightclubs

#### Vehicle break-ins

Vehicle break-ins happen, especially at petrol stations and service areas along the highway.

To avoid vehicle break-ins:

* watch your vehicle and belongings at rest areas
* always lock your vehicle
* use anti-theft devices
* don't leave valuable items in your vehicle
* park in well-lit areas
* use secure parking garages
* Check the [Slovenian Police Force](https://www.policija.si/eng/prevention/for-foreign-tourists)for advice if you're a victim of crime.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people are usually peaceful but can turn violent. They can disrupt traffic and public transport.

Protests in Ljubljana are usually held in and around Kongresni Trg (Congress Square), opposite the Slovenian Parliament.

To stay safe:

* avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media
