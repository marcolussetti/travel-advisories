#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)
* If you plan to undertake high-risk activities, such as mountaineering or skiing, make sure your travel insurance covers you in an emergency.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Slovenia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription, and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

West Nile virus (WNV) cases have been reported in Slovenia. There's no vaccine to prevent WNV.

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) is a risk in forested and rural areas.

They're active from March to November.

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* check your body for ticks during and after visiting forests
* remove ticks as soon as possible, making sure to remove the whole tick
* monitor the tick site for signs of infection

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is of a similar standard to Australia.

Slovenia and Australia have a [reciprocal health care agreement](/before-you-go/health/reciprocal-health "Reciprocal health care agreements"), which may provide some emergency care to Australians.

Most agreements specify the care must be urgent and medically necessary. They usually need a co-payment from the patient. Medical evacuations aren't covered by the agreement.

Costs for public hospital stays can reach thousands of dollars, depending on the treatment you need.
