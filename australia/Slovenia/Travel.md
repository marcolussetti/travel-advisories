#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Slovenia is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This means you can enter Slovenia without a visa in some cases.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Slovenia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/181) for details about visas, currency, and customs/quarantine rules.

Ensure that you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian government can't assist you if you don’t meet the requirements.

#### Border measures

Land borders are open, but you may be subject to random border checks by authorities, particularly at borders with Croatia, Austria and Hungary.

Make sure you:

* check that the entry stamp in your passport is readable when you enter the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") for the first time. Customs officials may ask you to show them an onward or return ticket.
* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")
* meet all entry and exit conditions - if you don't, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. 

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Slovenia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/181) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport.](https://www.passports.gov.au)

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency in Slovenia is the Euro (EUR).

Declare more than 10,000 euros or equivalent funds if you're travelling between Slovenia and a non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not just cash. Failure to do so will result in fines.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

ATMs may be rare in mountain areas or small villages.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive on your Australian driver's licence for up to 12 months after arrival.

Some car hire agencies may need you to have an International Driving Permit (IDP). Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Slovenia's main roads are generally safe and in good condition. However, secondary roads tend to be narrow.

The road network is well-developed with clearly marked road signs.

Road rules are similar to those used throughout Europe.

Roads in alpine areas can become dangerous during winter. You must use winter tyres from 15 November to 15 March or whenever winter weather conditions otherwise require. If you do not use winter tyres, you must have snow chains in your vehicle ready for use.

You must purchase an e-vignette before driving on motorways. E-vignettes can be purchased online on the [DARs website](https://evinjeta.dars.si/en) or at DARs points of sale, such as petrol stations and post offices.

By law:

* always have your headlights on (even during the daytime)
* carry a reflective vest, a spare wheel, a spare set of head light bulbs and a warning triangle in your vehicle
* carry a first aid kit in your vehicle

Check your rental car is fitted with the required equipment.

Police issue on-the-spot fines for traffic violations. They may take your passport and other documents if you refuse to pay.

You may need to appear before a police court judge.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer that your policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis are reliable and safe. Make sure the meter is running.

#### Public transport

Slovenia's public transport network is well-developed and reliable.

Take care of your personal belongings, particularly on trains and in major transport hubs. Don't leave bags unattended on trains, even briefly.
