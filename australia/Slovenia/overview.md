### Safety

Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, tourist areas,  markets, shopping areas, transport hubs, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, theft from vehicles and highway robberies can happen. Be careful on public transport, in tourist areas, petrol stations and highway parking areas. Use secure parking facilities.
* Drink spiking can occur at nightclubs.
* Avalanches, flash floods and mudslides occur in alpine areas. Monitor local weather. Follow the advice of local authorities. Stick to marked slopes and trails when skiing, hiking, and mountain climbing.
