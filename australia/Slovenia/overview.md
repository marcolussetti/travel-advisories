## Overview

### Safety

* Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, tourist areas,  markets, shopping areas, transport hubs, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, theft from vehicles and highway robberies can happen. Be careful on public transport, in tourist areas, petrol stations and highway parking areas. Use secure parking facilities.
* Drink spiking can occur at nightclubs.
* Avalanches, flash floods and mudslides occur in alpine areas. Monitor local weather. Follow the advice of local authorities. Stick to marked slopes and trails when skiing, hiking, and mountain climbing.

* The standard of medical facilities is similar to Australia's.

### Travel

* Slovenia is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This means you can enter Slovenia without a visa in some cases.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Slovenia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/181) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. Ensure that you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian government cannot assist you if you don't.
