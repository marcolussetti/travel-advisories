# Safety

#### Crime

The Colombian government has declared a state of emergency due to increased violence in the Catatumbo region, adjacent to the Venezuelan border in the department of Norte de Santander. There may be increased military presence and movement restrictions in the area.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime and gang activity is common.

'[Express kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)' also occurs. Criminals abduct people and force them to withdraw funds from ATMs before releasing them. The victim may be held overnight so that a second withdrawal can be made the next day. There have been incidents where those who have resisted have been killed or injured. Hailing taxis on the street can make you vulnerable to this threat. Use a phone dispatch service or taxi service app to book a licensed taxi. Ask for help from staff at hotels, restaurants or entertainment venues.

Hikers are sometimes robbed at gunpoint, including when hiking on trails in and around Bogotá. Reduce your risk by hiring a reputable, experienced tour guide.

Always be alert to your own safety and security. If you suspect criminals have drugged you or your fellow travellers, get urgent medical help.

Criminals also target foreigners and tourists using popular dating applications and websites, particularly in larger cities such as Bogotá, Cali, Medellín and Cartagena.

If you travel to remote areas, travel with recognised tour operators and arrange for security throughout your visit. Look for up-to-date advice from the local authorities before each stage of your journey. Be aware that mobile and internet connections in rural areas are often limited.

The towns of Bahía Solano, Nuquí and Capurganá in Chocó are popular eco-tourism destinations. However, most of Chocó department is remote. Illegal armed groups are active and involved in the drug trade throughout the department, particularly near the border with Panama. If you travel to these towns, only do so by air and don't travel inland or along the coast out of town.

If you travel to Ciudad Perdida (The Lost City) in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, you should do this as part of an organised tour. If you travel to Parque Nacional Tayrona, don't venture inland. Stick to designated paths, beach areas and resorts.

The tourist site of Caño Cristales is located in the Department of Meta, in the Parque Nacional Natural de la Macarena. If you are travelling to Caño Cristales, only do so with a reputable tour company, and travel by air to and from the town of La Macarena.

If travelling in La Guajira, avoid the area close to the border with Venezuela. Be aware that medical services are limited. Hire the services of a reputable tour company. Be ready for high temperatures, scarce drinking water and food. Unsure you bring enough water and food.

When travelling to the archaeological park at San Agustin in the department of Huila, only enter and leave the park on the main road through Popayán or Neiva.

Drug-related criminal activity also creates danger in places where cultivation, processing and transport occur. There is evidence of high levels of coca cultivation and related criminal activity in the following Departments in Colombia:

* Arauca
* Caquetá
* Cauca
* Guaviare
* Meta
* Nariño
* Putumayo
* Norte de Santander
* northern Antioquia and
* southern Bolivar

It also creates increased danger in:

* regions within 20km of the Venezuelan and Ecuadorian borders
* the port cities of Buenaventura, Turbo and Tumaco
* the Darién Gap (Panamanian border)

There is a risk to your safety in any area where coca, marijuana or opium poppies are cultivated and near cocaine processing labs. In these areas, criminal groups attack, extort, kidnap, detonate car bombs and damage infrastructure.

Don't take risks or make yourself a target for criminals. To protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid travelling at night
* fly into Colombia during the day if possible
* keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even while moving
* stay in reputable accommodation with good security
* try not to travel by road in rural areas (fly instead)
* be careful when travelling alone, or travelling in or near tugurios (slums)
* use ATMs inside banks, shopping centres or other public locations during business hours and avoid using ATMs on the street
* avoid walking alone in isolated or deserted areas

#### Movement restrictions for minors in Medellin

Authorities in Medellin have imposed movement restrictions on unaccompanied minors (under the age of 18) in areas of the city where they're considered to be at higher risk of sexual exploitation. Minors aren't allowed to transit or stay in these areas between 7pm - 5am unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

The areas of Medellin subject to the restrictions are listed in decree [0082 2024](https://www.medellin.gov.co/es/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Decreto-0082-de-2024.pdf) (Spanish) and include:

* El Poblado (including Parque Lleras)
* parts of Corredor vial de la 33
* La Candelaria (including Plaza de Botero)
* Parroquia de la Veracruz, and
* parts of Corredor de la 70.

If you're travelling with a minor in Medellin, ensure that they carry proper identification (e.g. a photocopy of their passport) and follow the instructions of local authorities.

These restrictions will remain in place until 31 July.

#### Incapacitating drugs

Criminals in Colombia are increasingly using drugs to subdue their victims, including a growing number of foreign citizens. This may include using scopolamine or similar drugs that temporarily incapacitate the victim. Robberies and assaults occur after victims accept spiked food, drinks, cigarettes or chewing gum. Some victims have been killed. Criminals may also administer these drugs by aerosol spray or paper handouts. A large number of these incidents have involved the use of online dating apps to lure victims.

These drugs can cause serious medical problems, including loss of consciousness and memory loss. Unsuspecting victims become disoriented quickly and are vulnerable to robbery, sexual assault and other crimes. Hotspots include nightclubs, bars, restaurants, public buses and city streets, where criminals usually target people who are alone. Exercise caution when being approached by a stranger and avoid meetings arranged to take place in isolated locations.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is also common, particularly in larger cities such as Bogota, Cali, Medellin and Cartagena. This includes in major tourist areas, near hotels and at the airport in Bogotá. Don't carry large amounts of money or wear valuable watches or jewellery. Avoid using your mobile phone, cameras and other electronic equipment in the street. Avoid deprived areas of the cities. Tourists have been robbed at gunpoint.

Organised criminals operate in urban areas, including Bogotá and Medellín.

Criminals pose as police officers in Bogotá and popular tourist towns to conduct scams (asking to verify documents or foreign currency). People have reported harassment, theft and extortion. If approached, ask to be escorted to the nearest CAI ('Centro de Atención Inmediata') – the local police station.

Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Always keep photocopies of these documents with you, as local authorities often conduct identity checks.

Be alert on public transport. Don't leave your luggage unattended, in overhead bins or under the seat on buses, as they could be stolen while you're not watching or asleep.

Card overcharging is common. Be careful in popular tourist areas, where scammers target tourists by charging them elevated prices for services, food and drink. Ask for a printed price list before ordering, and check for any unauthorised transactions on your account statements. Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others and cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN.

Smash-and-grab attacks are common. Thieves snatch items from cars stopped at traffic lights. Keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving. Be alert to threats, including when stopped in traffic.

Take only the cash you need for the day and don't carry unnecessary valuables.

#### Ayahuasca or yage tourism

Ayahuasca or yage tourism is a growing industry, especially in the jungle regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Shamans perform psychedelic rituals of spiritual cleansing with this traditional plant. The individuals offering these rituals are not formally licensed or regulated.

Yage is not illegal in Colombia, but its consumption is not regulated, and its interaction with existing medical conditions is not well understood.

Most facilities lack basic first aid or emergency plans for people who suffer physical or mental health effects after ceremonies. Participants report symptoms from being more alert but lacking control to amnesia. Effects could also include severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

Ceremonies often occur in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health resources and limited communication with local authorities.

Some participants have also been assaulted and robbed.

If you decide to take part in ayahuasca tourism:

* research potential ayahuasca tour operators before signing up
* avoid participating in ayahuasca rituals without a trusted friend present
* check if any existing medical condition may be aggravated by the use of ayahuasca
* check if your travel insurance covers health effects due to this type of experience

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks remain a significant threat, even though security has improved.

Attacks could occur anywhere and at any time in Colombia.

Possible targets include:

* government, military and police sites, or personnel
* airports
* public transport
* nightclubs, hotels and restaurants
* shopping malls
* corporate facilities

The most well-known terrorist groups, the dissident groups of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) guerrillas:

* mainly target Colombian government and economic infrastructure
* sometimes target foreign companies and employees
* use terrorist-style tactics to conduct small-scale attacks

The FARC handed in their weapons in June 2017 as part of a peace agreement with the government. However, dissident groups continue to operate.

The Colombian government has announced an attempt to reach peace agreements and cease-fires with various armed groups. There has been an increase in terrorist attacks by the ELN and the Clan del Golfo. The ELN has organised attacks against government and economic targets and announced a number of national 'armed strikes'.

Cartels also operate, the most well-known being the Clan del Golfo.

These groups can cause the security situation to deteriorate rapidly in some regions.

Some recent attacks include:

* May 2022 – the Clan del Golfo cartel paralysed parts of northern Colombia for 4 days during an 'armed strike'. People died.
* March 2022 – a bomb exploded outside a police station in Bogotá's Ciudad Bolivar district. People died.

Terrorists, criminals and armed gangs operate in small towns and rural areas, which can be dangerous for travellers. Armed gangs are called 'BACRIM' in Spanish.

There is a risk of antipersonnel landmines left by terrorist and criminal groups in rural areas. These may be found in unmarked areas, including near main roads in rural areas and villages. Avoid remote rural areas and use designated roads.

Violence due to the BACRIM has spilled over into major cities. These groups are involved in drugs, extortion, kidnapping and robbery.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* look out for possible threats
* avoid possible targets for terror attacks, where possible
* report any suspicious activity or items to police
* monitor the media for emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping occurs in Colombia. Criminals sometimes kidnap and murder foreigners. Most kidnappings are for ransom. Groups such as the FARC dissident groups and the ELN in rural areas are involved in kidnapping. Express kidnapping is also a problem in major urban areas, and virtual kidnappings have been reported.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and protests take place regularly throughout Colombia, especially in large cities. Protests and rallies may occur around elections or on commemorative days.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Strikes are common and can affect local transport and traffic. Protesters or criminal groups may set up roadblocks, especially in rural areas.

If you visit areas affected by strikes and roadblocks, you may be unable to leave for days or weeks.

Get advice on current road closures from the Colombian Highway Police information line. Call #767.

It's illegal to participate in local political activities, rallies or public demonstrations if you've entered Colombia for tourist purposes or on a visa. Political involvement may result in you being deported.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests and rallies
* if a protest occurs, leave if it's safe to do so
* monitor the news for possible unrest and avoid those places
* follow advice from local authorities

#### Border with Venezuela

Don't attempt to cross the Venezuela-Colombia border by land, even if it's open. Avoid travelling within 20 km of the Venezuelan border.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Colombia experiences [natural disasters](/node/346) and [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* [volcanoes](/node/346)
* landslides and mudslides
* flooding
* [hurricanes](/node/346)
* [tsunamis](/node/346)
* [bushfires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire)

High temperatures may cause bushfires across Colombia. Bushfires can move rapidly and be unpredictable. They can also cause air pollution to reach levels that can pose a risk to your health, affect air traffic and road travel.

Volcanoes may be active. Get advice on recent volcanic activity from local authorities if you plan to go hiking. Check the updated [bulletins on volcanic activity](https://www2.sgc.gov.co/Noticias/boletinesDocumentos/Forms/AllItems.aspx) (Spanish).

There is a risk of earthquakes, especially in the Andean region. Updated information on earthquake activity can be found on the [Colombia’s Geological Services](https://www.sgc.gov.co/sismos) website.

Colombia can experience tsunamis. Large and destructive tsunamis happen more often in the Pacific Ocean due to large earthquakes along major tectonic plates and ocean trenches.​

Many parts of Colombia experience heavy rainfall. Landslides, mudslides and flooding are common and can affect travel to some parts of the country.

Monitor the news and ask for local advice before entering affected areas.

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

Coastal areas of Colombia can experience hurricanes. Hurricanes usually occur from mid-May to the end of November.

If a hurricane is approaching:

* find a local shelter
* follow advice from local authorities
* monitor the media for updates

If there's a hurricane:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* flights out may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available

To stay safe:

* know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plans
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* keep in touch with friends and family
