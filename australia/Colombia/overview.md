# Overview

Latest update

Yellow fever is widespread in Colombia. Some airlines may want to see your yellow fever vaccination on departure. Some countries may also require you to show a yellow fever vaccination certificate if you've travelled through the country (see ‘Health’).   
  
We continue to advise exercise a high degree of caution in Colombia overall due to the threat of violent crime and terrorism. We also advise do not travel to the Catatumbo region in Norte de Santander and Cesar, and the department of Cauca (except Popayán and the Pan American Highway), amongst other areas, due to increased violence from illegal armed groups and other criminal organisations.   
  
There's been an increase in foreigners, including Australians, who have been assaulted and robbed using incapacitating drugs (see 'Safety'). If you plan to travel from Colombia to Ecuador through the land border crossings, you're required to present an apostilled police check covering the previous five years (see 'Travel').

## Overview

### Safety

* The Colombian government has declared a state of emergency due to increased violence in the Catatumbo region, adjacent to the Venezuelan border in the department of Norte de Santander. There may be increased military presence and movement restrictions in the area.
* Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks around Colombia. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Violent crime and gang activity are common and increasing. Criminals may pose as police officers.
* Criminals use incapacitating drugs to subdue their victims. Robberies and assaults occur after victims accept spiked food, drinks, cigarettes or chewing gum. Incidents have involved the use of online dating apps. Don't accept food or drink from strangers.
* Don't travel alone or at night. Drug-related crime, terrorism and civil unrest make some areas very dangerous. These include the regions within 20km of the Venezuelan and Ecuadorian borders, the department of Cauca, the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco, and the Darién Gap. Avoid these areas.
* Kidnapping occurs in some areas of Colombia. If you’re travelling to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, seek professional security.
* Ayahuasca tourism is a growing and unregulated industry in Colombia, some participants have reported being assaulted and robbed.
* Hikers are sometimes robbed at gunpoint. Hire a reputable, experienced guide. Petty crime, such as theft, occurs in tourist areas.

### Health

* Yellow fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel. A vaccination certificate is required to enter Colombia if arriving from, or transited through Angola, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo or Uganda. Some countries may require you to present a yellow fever vaccination certificate if you’ve travelled through Colombia. Some national parks require a vaccination certificate to enter.
* Zika virus is also widespread. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor.
* Malaria is a risk in areas below 800m. This doesn't include Bogotá. Consider taking anti-malarial medication if travelling to these areas.
* Altitude sickness is a risk to anyone above 2500m (this includes Bogotá). Get advice from your doctor. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical evacuation from high altitude.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk for travellers. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to risk of infection.
* The standard of private hospitals in Bogotá and other major cities is reasonable. Medical facilities are limited elsewhere. You'll need to pay upfront. Check your travel insurance covers medical evacuation.
