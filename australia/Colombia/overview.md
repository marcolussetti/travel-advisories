# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise exercise a high degree of caution in Colombia due to the threat of violent crime and terrorism. The Colombian government has declared a state of emergency due to increased violence in the Catatumbo region, adjacent to the Venezuelan border in the department of Norte de Santander. There may be increased military presence and movement restrictions in the area.   
  
There's been an increase in foreigners, including Australians, who have been assaulted and robbed using incapacitating drugs (see 'Safety'). If you plan to travel from Colombia to Ecuador through the land border crossings, you're required to present an apostilled police check covering the previous five years (see 'Travel').

## Overview

### Safety

* The Colombian government has declared a state of emergency due to increased violence in the Catatumbo region, adjacent to the Venezuelan border in the department of Norte de Santander. There may be increased military presence and movement restrictions in the area.
* Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks around Colombia. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Violent crime and gang activity are common and increasing. Criminals may pose as police officers or spike drinks and food. Don't accept food or drink from strangers.
* Don't travel alone or at night. Drug-related crime, terrorism and civil unrest make some areas very dangerous. These include the regions within 20km of the Venezuelan and Ecuadorian borders, the cities of Buenaventura and Tumaco, and the Darién Gap. Avoid these areas.
* Kidnapping occurs in some areas of Colombia. If you’re travelling to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, seek professional security.
* Ayahuasca tourism is a growing and unregulated industry in Colombia, some participants have reported being assaulted and robbed.
* Hikers are sometimes robbed at gunpoint. Hire a reputable, experienced guide. Petty crime, such as theft, occurs in tourist areas.
