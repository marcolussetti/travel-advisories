#### Visas and border measures

Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering. 

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

If you're visiting for tourism and plan to stay for 90 days or less, you generally won't need a visa to enter Colombia. You may need to show an onward or return ticket, or proof of sufficient funds.

Immigration officers can refuse your entry even if you meet the criteria for visa-free entry. You must present an onward or return ticket with a departure date that's within the 90-day period allowed for visitor entry into Colombia.

For other situations, you'll need to get a visa before you travel.

If you're issued with a Colombian visa with more than 90 days validity, you must register the visa at a Migración Colombia office or [online](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf) within 15 days of arrival in Colombia. You'll face fines if you don't register the visa on time.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the closest [embassy or consulate of Colombia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/45) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

You may be able to extend your stay once you are in Colombia by up to 120 days. As a visitor, you can't remain in Colombia for more than 180 days in a calendar year. Contact [Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) (Spanish) for further information.

Don't overstay your visa, or you'll be fined or risk deportation at your own cost.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the USA, you must meet USA entry or transit requirements.

Check your visa requirements with your nearest [embassy or consulate of the United States](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212) before you travel.

#### Travel via Chile

If you’re travelling via Chile, ensure you meet all current entry or transit requirements.

#### Border crossings

All land, sea and river borders are open. Entry and exit restrictions at borders may change at short notice. If crossing borders, check with local migration authorities for current restrictions.

From 12 January 2024, when entering Ecuador via land borders you're required to present an apostilled police check covering the previous five years. The police check from Australia is obtained through the [Australian Federal Police](https://www.afp.gov.au/our-services/national-police-checks) and can be [apostilled in Australia](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") or at an Australian Embassy when overseas.

We recommend you do not travel to border areas or cross some borders due to a high risk of terrorism and violent crime.

* don't attempt to cross the Venezuela-Colombia border by land, or travel within 20 km of the Venezuelan border
* don't attempt to cross the Panama-Colombia border by land, or travel to the Darién Gap (except the town of Capurganá)
* don't travel to within 20 km of the Ecuador border, except for the Pan-American highway crossing at Ipiales.

#### Entry stamp

You must get an entry stamp in your passport if you enter by land. Failure to do so may result in a fine on departure. If the immigration office on the border is closed, seek help at the nearest office of [Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) (Spanish).

Check your entry stamp carefully. Officials will fine you if you stay in the country longer than your entry stamp allows.

#### Other formalities

#### Airport tax

You need to pay an [airport tax](https://eldorado.aero/en/comunicados/airport-tax) when you leave. This is usually included in your ticket price. Confirm with your airline or travel agent at the time of purchase.

If you’re travelling to the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia or Santa Catalina you must purchase a tourist card from the airport you're travelling from. You can usually buy this at the boarding gate on the day of your flight. Tourists staying less than 24 hours on the islands, and children under 7 years, are exempt. Check with your airline to confirm the details prior to your travel.

#### Travel with children

A child under the age of 18 years who is a Colombian citizen, or resident travelling alone or with one parent must carry:

* a letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) that authorises travel. It must include the proposed destination, the purpose of the trip, the date of departure and the return date.
* a copy of the child's birth certificate

Both documents must be translated into Spanish and notarised by a local notary or by the Colombian Embassy or Consulate in Australia.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Colombia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/45) well before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months after your departure date from Colombia.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* in Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* if you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

You can use emergency passports to enter, transit and exit Colombia. They must be valid for at least six months from when you plan to leave. You must get an entry stamp in your passport if you enter by land. Failure to do so may result in a fine on departure. If the immigration office on the border is closed, seek help at the nearest office of [Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) (Spanish).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

**More information:**

* [LGBTQIA+ travellers](/before-you-go/staying-safe/cyber-security "Cyber security when travelling overseas")

#### Money

The local currency is the Colombian Peso (COP).

You can enter or exit Colombia with up to US$10,000 in cash, or its equivalent in any currency. Anything in excess of this amount must be declared on arrival and may be confiscated.

You can change US dollars and euros in exchange bureaus and commercial banks.

Major hotels and tourist places accept international credit cards.

ATM and credit card facilities are more limited in rural areas. Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work in Colombia.

Credit card fraud and robbery at ATMs is common.

#### Local travel

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as diving.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/node/356):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Colombia, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Road conditions, including on major highways, can vary significantly in Colombia. You're more likely to be killed in a vehicle accident in Colombia than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* aggressive driving
* poor lighting

Other risks when you travel by road, particularly in rural areas, include:

* protests
* landslides and flooding
* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* other violence, including roadblocks by illegal armed groups
* landmines (not all areas with landmines are marked)

Major highways between large cities are of relatively good quality and suitable for land travel. This includes Ruta 25 (Barranquilla-Ipiales), Ruta del Sol (Bogotá -Santa Marta), and Ruta 45 (Bogotá-Medellín). Always exercise a high degree of caution when travelling by road.

Where major highways pass through a 'Reconsider your need to travel' or 'Do not travel' area, avoid detours off the major highway, never travel at night, and closely monitor local news and authorities for information on the highway conditions and incidents that may affect the route.

Get advice on current road closures from the Colombian Highway Information line. Call #767.

Do not cross between Panama and Colombia by land. It's impossible to drive between Colombia and Panama, as the Pan-American Highway has a break caused by a dense, mountainous jungle known as the Darién Gap. This area is dangerous, with a high risk of terrorism and violent crime. If you wish to take your vehicle to Panama, you must ship it from Cartagena to Colón, Panama.

When hiring a vehicle, do not hand over your passport as a form of security. Provide a photocopy instead. If you must have your original passport photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.

Check that your insurance has proper coverage. Read the rental contract, including liabilities or waivers when vehicles are damaged.

Always park vehicles in guarded parking lots, and do not leave valuables or bags visible inside the car.

If you're involved in an accident, call #767 to get urgent assistance.

To reduce your risks while travelling by road:

* check you have adequate insurance before driving
* learn local traffic laws and practices before driving
* avoid road travel in rural areas — if possible, fly between cities instead
* don't travel at night
* stay on well-travelled roads
* place belongings under your seat
* keep your doors locked and windows closed at all times
* carry a mobile phone
* park your car in a guarded parking lot when in a city
* monitor the media and get local advice on your proposed route before you travel
* tell friends or family of your travel plans and check in when you depart and arrive
* don't hitchhike

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Criminals frequently rob taxi passengers. You're more at risk when travelling alone and hailing taxis from the street.

Use a phone or ride-share service app to book a licensed taxi. Ask for help from staff at hotels, hostels, restaurants or entertainment venues. Be careful and pay attention to suspicious behaviour, even when taking transport booked via apps. If possible, avoid taking taxis or ride-shares by yourself.

El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá only allows authorised taxis to pick up passengers at their terminals. Authorised taxi booths can be found at El Dorado and most airports in Colombia. Consult the airport's website for more information.

#### Public transport

Pedestrians don't have the right of way, including at stop signs.

Public transport isn't always safe. Criminals frequently target buses.

Criminals acting as bus company staff tell people to put their personal belongings in the overhead bins. As soon as they're distracted, criminals steal their belongings. Many Australian travellers have been robbed like this.

To reduce your risks on public transport:

* book a vehicle from a reputable provider
* stay alert
* don't use overhead luggage compartments
* don't leave your belongings unattended

#### Boat travel

International cruise liners visit Cartagena, Santa Marta, San Andres Island and Buenaventura.

Be cautious when taking tourist boats directly from the northern Caribbean coast, particularly from Cartagena, San Andres or Santa Marta, and the nearby islands and beaches. Travel only in licensed boats and check for lifejackets and safety equipment.

Travelling by river is dangerous. Boats are often overloaded and lack lifesaving equipment.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.
