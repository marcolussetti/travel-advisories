#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what locations, activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Colombia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

You may find most medication in pharmacies in large cities, but medicine for complex treatments may be unavailable in rural areas and small towns. Pharmacies (called droguerías) require a prescription from a local doctor to acquire some medications. In larger cities most pharmacies have delivery services.

#### Health risks

#### Yellow fever and other insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread in Colombia. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It can be prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel. You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Colombia, especially if arriving from, or transiting through an airport in Angola, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo or Uganda.  Some airlines may want to see one when you leave. Some National Parks require proof of yellow fever vaccination to enter. More information is available at [Parques Naturales de Colombia](https://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/portal/es/parques-nacionales/).

If you are in Colombia, vaccination is available free of charge at El Dorado/Bogota Airport. You can also get a yellow fever vaccine at Red Cross offices, some of which are located in major shopping centres.

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care advises you to discuss travel plans with your doctor. Consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in all areas below 800m, which excludes Bogotá.

Other insect-borne diseases that are a risk include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria
* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Altitude sickness

Many areas are above 2500m, including Bogotá (2640m).

You may suffer altitude sickness above 2500m, especially if you ascend quickly.

Altitude sickness can be life-threatening. It can affect anyone, even if you're physically fit.

You're at more risk of altitude sickness if you:

* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before getting used to the altitude
* have health problems that affect breathing

If you plan to travel to high-altitude areas, see your doctor before you go.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk for travellers. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.

#### Cosmetic surgery

Foreign citizens have died or have been seriously injured when undergoing cosmetic or other elective surgeries using non-reputable providers. Use only reputable healthcare providers.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common, including:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Severe outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes in rural areas
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

Get medical help if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in private hospitals in Bogotá and other major cities is reasonable.

Services outside major cities can be limited.

Public medical facilities are generally poorly funded and equipped. They often lack adequate medical supplies. Ambulance services in remote areas are unreliable.

Treatment at private clinics and hospitals is expensive.

Doctors and hospitals expect cash payment or confirmation of travel insurance before treating you. This includes emergency care.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. People are usually evacuated to the USA. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
