# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

You must carry photo ID in Colombia. If you don't want to carry your passport, a [notarised copy](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") of the photo and visa pages is acceptable. You can get this done at the [Australian Embassy in Bogota](https://colombia.embassy.gov.au/).

Colombia has strong laws against[child sex crimes](/before-you-go/laws/child-sex-offences "Child sex offences"). Authorities have arrested and prosecuted a number of foreigners for these offences. Offenders face long prison sentences and may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Drugs

Colombia has severe penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs. This includes long sentences in local jails.

Colombian drug trafficking detection methods are sophisticated and anyone attempting to traffic drugs should expect to be arrested. Convicted offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions. Colombian law may require that released offenders serve a long parole period in Colombia.

Don’t get involved with illegal drugs.

Pack your own luggage, lock it and always keep it with you. Don’t carry items for other people.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to take photos of military bases and strategic sites.

#### Surrogacy

If you plan to take part in commercial surrogacy arrangements, be aware of all legal and other risks involved.

Although it is not illegal, surrogacy is not regulated by Colombian law. Get independent legal advice.

Research prospective clinics to ensure that you're dealing with a reputable organisation.

The Australian Embassy can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics or agencies

You may need to spend a significant amount of time in Colombia before and after the birth. The processes required to obtain Australian citizenship and an Australian passport may take up to 9 months. You need to be prepared to stay in Colombia during this time.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Colombian Government requires Colombian citizens to enter and exit on a Colombian passport or other valid Colombian travel document. This includes dual nationals.

You could face delays at immigration, or not be allowed to leave the country, if you're a dual national but you don't have a Colombian travel document.

If you're a male dual national aged over 18 years, you may be required to complete national service if you visit Colombia.
