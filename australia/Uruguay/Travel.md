#### Visa and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

Australian tourists can enter Uruguay without a visa for up to 90 days when travelling on a regular passport. There may be additional requirements if you travel on a different type of passport. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Uruguay for details](https://busquedaembajadas.mrree.gub.uy/busq_mrree/servlet/hbusqembajadas).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Uruguay for details](https://busquedaembajadas.mrree.gub.uy/busq_mrree/servlet/hbusqembajadas) about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Travelling with children

Authorities may need to see a [letter of consent](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/who-you-are/children) (Permiso de Menor) if a minor is:

* travelling alone, or
* travelling with one parent, or
* travelling with a guardian

Minors who are Uruguayan citizens or who are usual residents of Uruguay (one year of residence or more) need a travel permit from the non-accompanying parent/s to leave Uruguay.

For more information, see [travelling with minors to and from Uruguay](https://www.gub.uy/tramites/permiso-menor-edad) or contact the [nearest Uruguayan Embassy or Consulate](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-relaciones-exteriores/tematica/embajadas-consulados) for guidance.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Your passport must have at least one blank page at the time of your arrival in Uruguay.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Uruguay is the Peso (UYU).

Some locations also accept payment in US Dollars (USD). Several ATMs dispense USD. Electronic payment methods are used widely in Uruguay.

#### Local travel

Sometimes there are disruptions to local transport services. Be prepared to change your plans.

#### Driving permit

You can drive with an Australian driver's licence in Uruguay. You should carry a Spanish translation of your Australian licence if you're not carrying an international driving permit.

You must be aged 21 years or over to hire a car. Car rental companies will also need either:

* an Australian driver's licence, or
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Residents need to get a Uruguayan licence.

#### Road travel

Be careful when travelling by car. In Uruguay:

* driving standards are lower than in Australia
* many vehicles are poorly maintained
* drivers often ignore traffic rules

You're more likely to die in a car accident in Uruguay than in Australia.

There is zero tolerance for drink driving with a 0.0 blood alcohol limit, and you must use dimmed headlights when driving during the day.

Toll roads between the major cities are well maintained. You can pay cash for some tolls, but others require you to register and pay for your journey online. See the [Uruguayan Ministry of Tourism's website](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-turismo/comunicacion/noticias/pago-del-peaje-para-turistas-uruguay) for further information. The condition of other roads varies.

#### Accessibility

If you have a disability, you may find accessibility standards differ from Australia's. Don't assume that hotels will be accessible.

In Uruguay, anti-discrimination laws apply to people with disabilities, but they're not fully enforced.

Access to buildings, footpaths and road crossings may be difficult.
