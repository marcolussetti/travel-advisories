# Safety

#### Crime

Street crime occurs in Uruguay, particularly in Montevideo. This includes:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* petty theft
* robberies

Smash and grab robberies from cars stopped at traffic lights also occur.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* be cautious using ATMs and avoid using them on the street. Use ATMs in banks or shopping centres
* avoid carrying excess cash
* keep vehicle doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* avoid leaving valuables on display in cars, or in the boot if you are not in the vehicle
* don't resist if you're attacked or robbed
* pay attention to your belongings

Keep away from isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking downtown or in the port area alone, especially on weekends. In Montevideo, avoid the Cerro neighbourhood.

In Montevideo, crime increases at night and on weekends in:

* Puerto de Montevideo (the port area)
* Plaza Independencia
* La Ciudad Vieja (the old town)
* Avenida 18 de Julio

During summer, from December to March, thieves target beach resort areas, such as Punta del Este. You may encounter more petty street crimes and burglaries during these months.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.
