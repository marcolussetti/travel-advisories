# Safety

#### Security situation

#### Demonstrations

Demonstrations occur regularly in Bishkek and elsewhere across the country and can turn violent without warning. Avoid large crowds and any demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Border areas

Security is volatile in the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and Kyrgyz-Tajik border areas. This includes the Ferghana Valley.

Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement on their borders in 2023, but local authorities may still close border crossings at short notice. Smuggling and cross-border criminal activity occur, and the security situation can be volatile. Landmines are a risk in uncontrolled areas of the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border.

In 2022, military clashes in the Batken Region bordering Tajikistan escalated into an armed conflict, where more than 100 people were killed and 140 000 evacuated. The Kyrgyz Republic declared a state of emergency, which was lifted following a ceasefire agreement. The security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate further with little warning. Avoid all non-essential travel to the Kyrgyz-Tajik border area.

Violent crime and civil unrest occur often. There are frequent reports of terrorist activity.

There have been clashes between security forces and militant and criminal groups.

Security forces from Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan monitor border areas and often conduct operations there.

If you plan to travel to those regions, read the travel advice for [Uzbekistan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/uzbekistan) and [Tajikistan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/tajikistan).

#### Landmines

Landmines are a risk in the Kyrgyz-Uzbek, Kyrgyz-Tajik border areas and Batken Oblast near the Kyrgyz-Tajikistan border.

#### Crime

Crime, including violent crime, occurs often.

Criminals can target foreigners.

Kidnapping, pickpocketing, [muggings and robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) occur. Incidents have been reported near hotels, on public transport and in crowded places, especially where expats gather.

The risk of crime increases at night.

#### Petty crime

Thieves may target you by posing as:

* off-duty police
* uniformed police
* 'meet-and-greet' drivers at airports

If you think someone is posing as a police officer or official, offer to go with them to the nearest police station. Once there, you can verify their identity and their demands.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking is a risk and can happen anywhere.

Harmful substances added to alcoholic drinks can cause loss of consciousness, serious illness, blindness, brain injury or death. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

To lessen your risk:

* never accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers
* don't leave your food or drink unattended

#### Violent clashes

Foreigners can get caught up in violent clashes between criminal groups.

If you get into a dispute with locals, it might result in:

* officials detaining you
* lengthy legal proceedings

To reduce your risk of becoming a victim of crime:

* keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* always be alert to your surroundings
* avoid walking at night, especially if you're alone

When using taxis:

* avoid hailing taxis on the street
* book official taxis by phone if you can
* negotiate the price before the trip
* don't get in if there are other passengers

#### ATM card fraud

There have been cases of unauthorised withdrawals after people have used ATMs or EFTPOS machines.

To reduce your risk:

* use ATMs in controlled areas, such as in banks or large hotels
* check for skimming devices before you insert your card
* keep your credit card in sight when paying for things

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

Criminal kidnappings can occur in the Kyrgyz Republic. Criminals can pose as police or 'meet-and-greet' drivers at the airport. 

The risk of crime increases at night. Always be alert to your surroundings. Avoid walking at night, especially if you're alone. 

The kidnapping of local women for marriage occurs in remote parts of the Kyrgyz Republic. Foreigners could fall victim to such kidnappings. 

If you're female, take care when travelling alone outside major cities. 

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.  

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:  

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel, and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.
