#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the Kyrgyz Republic. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor. The documents must be translated into Russian. The letter should state:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Declare all medicine on arrival. Even with a prescription, you could face charges if you either:

* don't declare restricted medicines, or
* carry amounts over the legal limit

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Ticks carrying [encephalitis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/encephalitis) are common in forested areas from spring to autumn.

Regularly check your body for ticks during and after visits to forest areas.

If a tick bites you:

* remove it from your body as soon as possible
* make sure you remove the whole tick
* monitor the site for any signs of infection

Other insect-borne diseases occur, including [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis).

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Bishkek are limited. Medical equipment and medicines are in short supply.

The standard of medical services in remote areas is basic.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you could need treatment in a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
