# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in the Kyrgyz Republic cooperate closely with agencies in other Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties are severe for carrying or using illegal drugs. They can include lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines. Drugs of any amount that may be legal in Australia, even in small quantities, may be illegal in the Kyrgyz Republic.

#### Legalising documents

If you plan to marry in the Kyrgyz Republic, you'll need a Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage (CNI). Contact the [Australian Embassy in Moscow](http://www.russia.embassy.gov.au/mscw/home.html) to find out how to apply.

You'll need an [apostille](/node/361) for Australian-issued documents.

This includes if:

* you plan to live or work in the Kyrgyz Republic
* you plan to stay long periods

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of the Kyrgyz Republic](http://mfa.gov.kg/en/embassies/all) about legalising documents.

Be aware that it's illegal to:

* not carry ID
* drive with a blood alcohol reading over 0%
* take photos of military and security establishments

Always carry your passport or a certified copy. Identity checks by police are common.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Kyrgyz Republic doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services#ourservices) we can provide if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services#passports).

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, dress modestly and seek local advice.

Obvious displays of affection, even between married couples, can offend. Police may harass or detain you.

Same-sex relationships are legal in the Kyrgyz Republic but aren't widely accepted.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in the Kyrgyz Republic. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
