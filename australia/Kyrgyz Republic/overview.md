## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks have happened in the Kyrgyz Republic. Targets have included places popular with foreigners. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.
* In 2022, military clashes in the Batken Region bordering Tajikistan escalated into an armed conflict. The Kyrgyz Republic declared a state of emergency, which was lifted following a ceasefire agreement. The security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate further with little warning. Avoid all non-essential travel to the Kyrgyz-Tajik border area.
* Security is volatile in the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and Kyrgyz-Tajik border areas. This includes the Ferghana Valley. Crime, civil unrest, terrorist activity, clashes, and landmines are risks. Security forces monitor border areas and often conduct operations there.
* Demonstrations occur regularly in Bishkek and elsewhere across the country and can turn violent without warning. Avoid large crowds and any demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Violent crime, kidnapping, robbery, mugging and pickpocketing occur. Criminals can pose as police or 'meet-and-greet' drivers at the airport. The risk of crime increases at night. Always be alert to your surroundings. Avoid walking at night, especially if you're alone.
* Cases of unauthorised withdrawals are reported after people have used ATMs or EFTPOS machines. Use ATMs in controlled areas, such as in banks or large hotels. Check for skimming devices. Keep your credit card in sight when paying for things.
* Drink spiking is a risk. Don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers. Never leave your food or drink unattended.
* There's a high risk of earthquakes in the Kyrgyz Republic. Tremors, avalanches and landslides are common. People have died in snow-related accidents in recent years. Monitor local media and other sources, such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/).

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases can occur, including leishmaniasis. Use insect repellent. Make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Ticks carrying encephalitis are common in forested areas from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks during and after visits to forest areas.
* Other infectious diseases include typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis, tuberculosis, brucellosis and rabies. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food and unpasteurised dairy products. If an animal bites or scratches you, get immediate medical help.
* Medical facilities in Bishkek are limited. In remote areas, they're basic. Medical equipment and medicines are in short supply.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Drugs of any amount that may be legal in Australia, even in small quantities, may be illegal in the Kyrgyz Republic. Severe penalties apply and include lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines.
* You need a Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage if you plan to marry in the Kyrgyz Republic. Contact the [Australian Embassy in Moscow](http://www.russia.embassy.gov.au/mscw/home.html) for information.
* If you plan to live or work in the Kyrgyz Republic or stay for long periods, you'll need an apostille for Australian-issued documents. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of the Kyrgyz Republic](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/108) for details.
* It's illegal to drive with a blood alcohol reading over 0%. It's illegal to take photos of military and security establishments. Always carry your passport or a certified copy at all times. ID checks by police are common.
* Law enforcement agencies in the Kyrgyz Republic cooperate closely with agencies in other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in a CIS country or have engaged in activities that might broadly constitute an offence in the CIS country, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.
* Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative. Displays of affection, even between married couples, can offend. Police may harass or detain you. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, dress modestly and seek local advice.

### Travel

* You don't need a tourist visa to stay for up to 60 days. You can apply for an e-visa (Sapar) for tourism, private and business for up to 90 days. If you stay longer than 60 days, you will need to register your details with the State Registration Service. Contact your airline or the nearest [embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/tokyo) to confirm visa and entry requirements.
* There are some HIV/AIDS restrictions for visitors and residents. You'll need an HIV test to apply for a work visa. Check with an [embassy or consulate of the Kyrgyz Republic](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/tokyo)before you travel.
* The economy is mainly cash-based. Only a few major hotels accept traveller's cheques and credit cards.
