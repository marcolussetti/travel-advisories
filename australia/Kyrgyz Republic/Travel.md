#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You don't need a tourist visa to stay up to 60 days.

In other cases, you'll need a visa.

You can apply for an e-visa (Sapar) for tourism, private and business purposes for up to 90 days.

To apply, visit the [e-visa website](http://www.evisa.e-gov.kg/).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Kyrgyz Republic](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/embassies/all) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Many flights in and out of the Kyrgyz Republic stopover in Russia. You'll need to meet visa requirements for any countries you'll transit through.

Contact your airline or the nearest embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic to confirm visa and entry requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Registration

You will need to register your details online or in person with the State Registration Service if you stay longer than 60 days.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter the Kyrgyz Republic if you arrive from a country with yellow fever.

#### HIV test

There are some [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) restrictions for visitors and residents.

You'll need an HIV test to apply for a work visa.

Check with an [embassy or consulate of the Kyrgyz Republic](http://mfa.gov.kg/en/embassies/all) before you travel.

#### Border crossings

Kyrgyz Republic's borders can close without notice.

Some border crossings may only open for local residents. Others may be open to some nationalities but not Australians.

Strict border controls apply on the road between Bishkek and Almaty in Kazakhstan. Expect delays at the border crossing for customs checks.

If you plan to cross any of Kyrgyz Republic's borders, check with local authorities first. They can tell you:

* the latest conditions for border crossing
* which border crossings Australians can use

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If hotel staff ask to photocopy your passport, make sure they return it promptly.

Losing your passport in the Kyrgyz Republic might be costly and might delay your travel plans. You'll need to get an exit visa and a replacement passport.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Kyrgyzstani Som (KGS), but US dollars are widely used.

Currency controls are in place.

The economy is mostly cash-based. Only a few of the major hotels accept traveller's cheques and credit cards.

Carry sufficient cash to cover your needs. Contact your bank to ensure your Australian cards will work overseas.

#### Local travel

#### Border regions

The security situation in the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and Kyrgyz-Tajik border areas is volatile. This includes the Ferghana Valley. Landmines are present (See '[Safety').](#safety)

#### Driving permit

To drive in Kyrgyz Republic, you need both:

* an Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

Get your IDP in Australia before you leave.

#### Road travel

Road conditions and driving standards are poor.

Roads can be very hazardous in winter and at night.

It may be difficult to access service stations in rural areas. Diesel is often unavailable.

To stay [safe on the road](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety"):

* find out about local traffic laws and practices before driving
* keep your car windows and doors closed and locked at all times
* have plenty of petrol when driving in rural areas

If you're planning to travel by road to Kazakhstan, read the travel advice for [Kazakhstan](/destinations/asia/kazakhstan "Kazakhstan").

#### Motorcycles

Check your insurance policy covers you using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

It's safest to use registered taxis and authorised limousines. Arrange them through your hotel or resort.

Taxis are often poorly maintained (See '[Safety').](#safety)

#### Public transport

Bus and trolley car services operate in Bishkek.

Minibus services operate in regional areas.

Local buses and minibuses are often poorly maintained.

#### Air travel

Flight delays are common. Check your departure time with the airport.

The EU has banned airlines certified by Kyrgyz authorities from operating in EU airspace. The ban is due to safety concerns.

On 11 April 2022, the EU announced that 21 Russian owned airlines were banned from flying in EU airspace due to safety concerns.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. If you're flying domestically or internationally, you should research your aviation provider.

Check the [Kyrgyz Republic's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EX) with the Aviation Safety Network.
