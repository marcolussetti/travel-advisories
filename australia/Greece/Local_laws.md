# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Breaking the law can lead to severe penalties, large fines and jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug possession, use or trafficking, even small amounts, include heavy fines and prison sentences.

#### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognised in Greece.

Greek males aged 19 and above have military service obligations. You may have to do military service if you're a male Australian-Greek dual national. This can apply if you are of Greek descent and were born outside of Greece, even if you don't think you have Greek citizenship.

There are penalties if you don't comply, and you may be prevented from leaving Greece.

Get advice from the nearest Greek [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/77) before you travel if you:

* have Greek citizenship
* may be eligible for Greek citizenship

#### Local customs

Dress codes are relaxed in tourist areas and resorts. Dress modestly in places such as churches and religious buildings.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

Avoid public displays of affection, especially in rural areas.

Same-sex sexual activity is legal but isn't widely accepted.
