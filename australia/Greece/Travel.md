#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Greece is a part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This allows you to enter without a visa in some cases. Get an entry stamp in your passport from border control when you first enter the Schengen area.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice, and you'll need a visa in some situations. Contact the nearest Greek [Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/77) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area will be implemented in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

#### Other formalities

#### Recognition of nationality

If you were born in Greece, you might have problems entering if the place of birth stated on your Australian passport is no longer officially recognised by Greece.

Officials may deny entry, especially if you're entering Greece from the Republic of North Macedonia.

We can't intervene on your behalf if Greek officials refuse you entry to Greece.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Always carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Greece is the Euro.

You must declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Greece and any non-European Union (EU) country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You don't need to declare it if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

You'll be fined if you don't declare it or declare the wrong amount when entering or leaving Greece.

Greece has daily ATM withdrawal limits. However, they don't apply to most major foreign debit and credit cards.

If you have Greek citizenship, you can only take up to 10,000 euros when leaving Greece.

#### Local travel

#### Extension of stays

Extension of stays in Greece beyond the allowed 90 days isn't automatic. Requests for extension with the relevant local authority should be lodged at least 4 weeks before your visa-free period expires. Present your request to the office of the Greek police on aliens issues.

#### Driving permit

Australian driver's licences are officially recognised as valid for use in Greece. If you plan on driving in Greece, you may not need an International Driving Permit. Contact the [Greek Embassy or Consulate](https://www.mfa.gr/en/appendix/greece-bilateral-relations/a.html) for more information on your licence type.

Your licence must be valid for the type of vehicle you'll drive, including quad bikes, motorbikes, mopeds, motor scooters and other similar vehicles.

You could face a large fine if you don't have the correct licence. Your insurance won't cover you if you have an accident.

#### Road travel

Driving is hazardous due to aggressive driving and poor-quality roads and vehicles.  
During peak season, severe traffic congestion occurs in the main cities and on the islands.

Check your insurance covers car hire and using quad bikes, motorbikes or jet skis. Get advice on any gaps. Your insurance may have conditions such as holding the correct licence for vehicles. Make sure you're covered. Check what additional fees may apply for any damage to hire vehicles.

Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of any illegal substance is illegal. Insurers won't cover accidents when drivers are under the influence of alcohol.  
Driving offences may also attract heavy penalties.

#### Quad bikes and motorcycles

Quad bike and motorcycle accidents cause serious injuries and deaths every summer on the Greek islands. Operating or riding quad bikes and motorcycles while intoxicated is illegal.

Always wear a helmet. It's illegal not to wear one. It may also invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident.

If you experience any issues with the bike's operation, it's recommended that you return it to the rental company as soon as possible.

#### Taxis

Only use licensed taxis. Always ensure the driver uses the meter. Be careful when using credit cards to pay fares. Ask for and check your receipt.

#### Pedestrians

Drivers and motorcyclists often ignore traffic signals and drive through red lights. They rarely give way to pedestrians, including at pedestrian crossings.

Be very careful when crossing the road, including at traffic light controlled intersections and pedestrian crossings.

Traffic police sometimes direct traffic at major intersections. If the traffic lights conflict with police directions, you must follow the directions of the traffic police.

Footpaths in Greece are very narrow and often blocked. They are often made of tiles or marble and become very slippery when wet.

#### Sea travel

Ferries and large catamarans carry most visitors to the Greek islands. However, some services don't provide suitable access for people with disabilities.

During the tourist season, from May to October, be prepared for high temperatures and large crowds at popular seaports.

Usually, there are only one or two brief announcements on ferries before arrival or departure.

In most cases, you'll need to carry your luggage up and down stairs. Help with luggage is usually unavailable unless you've booked a private cabin in advance.  

Ferry services can be delayed or cancelled in bad weather, mainly due to strong winds. Check the forecast and reconfirm your departure with your travel provider if it looks like the weather may be a risk.

On some Greek islands, such as Santorini, smaller boats or tenders transport cruise ship passengers to and from shore. Passengers using tenders may have difficulty getting up and down stairs.

Arrange for a coach or taxi to collect you in advance, or you may find it difficult to get transport.

Make sure your insurance covers the following:

* any existing health condition
* your planned activities
* travel on ferry and cruise ships

Australian-flagged sailboats or yachts sailing in the Mediterranean may be subject to Greek and EU taxes and duties. Seek advice from the Hellenic Coast Guard or the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://www.mfa.gr/en/appendix/greece-bilateral-relations/a.html)of Greece before you travel. If you've been involved in a maritime accident, the Greek Coast Guard may request under its regulations to inspect your vessel to confirm it is seaworthy.
