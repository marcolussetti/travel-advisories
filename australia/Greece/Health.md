#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Greece. Take enough legal medicine for your trip in its original packaging. The name on the prescription should match the name on your passport.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Codeine and other prescription opiates can only be issued with a prescription from an accredited Greek medical professional.

For more information, contact the Greek National Organization of Medicines:

* By telephone: 0030 213 2040 395 / 285 / 225 / 000
* By email: [clearance@eof.gr](mailto:clearance@eof.gr) / [relation@eof.gr](mailto:relation@eof.gr)

#### Health risks

#### Heatwaves

Heatwaves are frequent over the summer months. They can cause heat exhaustion, heat stroke and death. Drink water, wear a hat and light clothing and stay in air-conditioned buildings or shaded areas. 

Many major tourist sites have little shade. At peak tourist periods, queues at major attractions can involve waiting over an hour in the sun. Plan your visit to these sites, keep an eye on the weather forecast, and follow the advice of local authorities.

Avoid hiking during heatwaves. If you do head out on a hike, don't go alone. Be sure to check the weather, plan your route, pack water, sunscreen and your phone, and tell someone where you're going and when you plan to be back.

#### Dust storms

Storms of dust from the Sahara Desert are increasing in frequency across Greece, particularly during Spring, worsening the air quality and reducing sunlight and visibility. If you have respiratory conditions, you should limit outdoor activities and consider wearing masks outside until the skies clear. 

#### Measles

Greece is experiencing an increase in [Measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles) cases.

Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Cases of [West Nile virus (WNV)](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) are increasing in Greece. There's no vaccine to prevent it.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Foodborne diseases

Outbreaks of foodborne diseases, including [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis), sometimes happen.

To protect yourself from illness, avoid:

* uncooked and under-cooked food
* unpasteurised dairy products

See a doctor immediately if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Services provided by hospitals and medical centres aren't free, and payment is required before you leave the facility. Sometimes, the medical provider may ask you for payment before you receive treatment.

The standard of medical facilities and care vary in quality. Public hospitals in Greece are below the standard in Australia. Considerable delays may be encountered with non-urgent surgeries and other medical treatments at public hospitals.

Public hospitals can have shortages of medical supplies, including essential medication. They also have limited nursing care. You may be asked to pay a fee for medical treatment at a hospital or medical centre. Friends and relatives are usually required to give or pay for around-the-clock care, including for tasks like helping you eat, wash and use the toilet.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need evacuation. This is more likely if you're in a remote area or on a Greek island. You might be moved to Athens or another place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Public ambulances can be slow to respond to emergencies and vary in quality. Private hospitals operate their own ambulances and provide better quality service.

Private hospital costs are high.
