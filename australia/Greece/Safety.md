# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is a serious issue in tourist areas, including Monastiraki and Syntagma Square in central Athens.

Theft, including pickpocketing, bag snatching and luggage slashing, is common on buses and trains to and from the Athens airport and on ferries to and from the Greek islands.

Organised groups of thieves often use distraction techniques, such as crowding and pushing at metro stop exits.

Tourists' belongings have been targeted at their short-term rental accommodation, with thefts of valuables and passports occurring while they are out.

To reduce the risk of theft:

* stay in physical contact with your belongings, particularly on public transport and on buses and trains to and from the airport
* be alert at tourist spots in central Athens and on the islands
* don't leave bags on the back of chairs or the floor in cafés or restaurants
* carry your day bag with one strap across your body and carry small backpacks at the front of your body
* if driving on holiday, keep your valuables with you, always lock your vehicle, and park in a well-lit area or a secure car park
* research your accommodation carefully and pay attention to your surroundings when checking in, particularly for self check-in accommodation.

#### Tourist scams

Tourist scams exist in Greece, including taxis, hotels, restaurants, and vehicle hire services. If you've been the victim of a scam, report your claims to the nearest Police station and be prepared to support your claim with evidence.

Under Greek law, all suppliers of goods and services must issue you a receipt.

#### Alcohol

The national legal age for buying and drinking alcohol is 18.

A standard drink can contain more alcohol than in Australia. This can apply to both the volume and strength of the alcohol. Be aware of how much you are consuming.

Consider the risks when drinking alcoholic beverages, particularly drinks made with spirits.

#### Drink Spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. You can become seriously ill after drinking contaminated alcohol.

Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

To stay safe:

* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks

If you suspect that you, or someone you're with, has been poisoned, get urgent medical attention. It could save you from permanent disability or death.

Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

#### Physical and sexual assault

Serious [physical](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/354) and [sexual assaults](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") occur in Athens and on islands, including Mykonos, Santorini, Zakynthos and Ios. There's also a risk of [drink spiking](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely") with the intention of sexual assault.

Racially motivated and homophobic attacks have occurred.

To protect yourself:

* don't walk alone in isolated areas at night, especially in the Athens suburb of Omonia and at the railway and bus stations of Larissa and Peloponissos
* save the location of your accommodation on the maps app on your phone for easy access
* keep an eye on your drink, and don't accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.
* create a shared communication chat with your fellow travellers to stay in touch if separated.

If you're a victim of sexual assault in Greece, it's your decision whether to report it to the police. In Greece, health professionals must notify the police when they have a patient who alleges they've been assaulted. Hospital staff may refuse to provide a full medical examination without a document from the police confirming you've reported the crime.

There have been instances where an alleged abuser has laid defamation charges against their accuser and/or their family members at the same time. This can result in the accuser being arrested.

If the case goes to trial, there's an expectation that the victim attend court in person to testify, regardless of whether they live in another country.

Before you travel, read our guidance on [reducing the risk of sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"). We also have an [advice page](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/sexual-assault-overseas) on what to do immediately after a sexual assault, reporting a sexual assault overseas, and available counselling.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism occurs in Europe. Targets across Europe have included:

* public transport
* transport hubs
* public places popular with tourists

European security services have disrupted some planned attacks in recent years.

Radical groups have staged attacks, mainly in Athens. Attackers have previously used bombs or guns. People have been injured but rarely killed. Substantial damage to buildings and vehicles can occur.

Terrorist targets have included:

* government institutions
* former government ministers
* the offices of members of parliament
* foreign diplomatic missions
* the police

Terrorists haven't targeted tourists. But some attacks have happened near popular tourist areas in central Athens, such as Syntagma Square.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* take care around areas terrorists tend to target
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests, strikes, demonstrations and events that draw large groups of people occur regularly and often with little notice, mainly in central Athens around Syntagma Square, Omonia Square and Exarchia. They can also occur in other major cities, including Thessaloniki around Aristotelous Square, Egnatia Street, the Arch of Galerius and the campus of Aristotle University. Protesters and police could clash. Sometimes petrol bombs and fireworks are thrown by protesters, and police deploy tear gas, water cannons and flash bangs.

Protests also occur on days of national or commemorative significance, including:

* 28 February - the anniversary of the 2023 Tempe rail disaster
* 1 May — Labour Day
* 17 November — the anniversary of the 1973 student riots
* 6 December — the anniversary of the 2008 riots

Violent clashes can occur between supporters of rival sporting teams. Molotov cocktails and stones have been thrown, and people have been killed.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid public protests
* monitor local media for possible unrest or strikes
* keep a low profile
* plan to avoid areas known for unrest on days of national significance
* change your travel plans if disruptions arise
* follow the advice of local authorities

Protests and strikes can disrupt taxi and ferry services and public transport. There may also be road closures. Monitor the media for news on protests or strikes that may impact your travel plans. Plan extra time for movements and be ready to change your travel plans if necessary.

#### Adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/node/356):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Water activities

Lifeguards operate at many Greek beaches from June to September. Riptides can lead to dangerous conditions at times. Check the local weather conditions before heading to the beach.

Be aware of and follow warning flags and signs. Most drownings occur on beaches without a lifeguard or outside of lifeguard hours.

Coral, urchins and jellyfish live in the waters off Greece. Always take care when entering the water and seek medical assistance if needed.
