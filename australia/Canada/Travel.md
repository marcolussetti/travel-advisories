#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian passport holders must apply for an [electronic travel authorisation (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/facts.html) before travelling to Canada by air.

If you arrive by car, bus, train, or boat, you don't need an ETA or a visitor visa, but you do need to bring the correct travel documents.

If you overstay your visa, you may be detained or arrested.

You may not be allowed into Canada if you have a criminal record, including a drink-driving conviction. Check [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/overcome-criminal-convictions.html) for details.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact a [Canadian embassy or consulate](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/embassies-consulates) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

You may need documentation if you travel[with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children"), pets or bring goods into Canada. Check with the [Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html).

Your child should carry a [consent letter](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/children/consent-letter) from non-travelling parents or guardians if they're travelling:

* alone
* with only one parent or guardian
* with friends, relatives or a group

CBSA may question the child or accompanying adult about their status.

#### Travel to Australia

Contact your travel provider for the latest flight options to Australia. Ensure you meet third-country transit requirements before you depart Canada.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you must meet US entry and transit requirements. Check your entry and transit requirements with an [embassy or consulate of the United States](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212).

Contact the [US Pre-clearance Office](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry/operations/preclearance) at the Canadian airport you're departing from to confirm that you'll be permitted to board your flight in Canada and transit through the United States.

#### Passport

#### Validity

If you're entering Canada using your Australian passport, you must ensure you have a valid passport that does not expire within 6 months of your trip. Different rules may apply in countries that you plan to transit or visit on your way to Canada. Be sure to check the entry requirements of those countries.

Some countries and airlines don't follow this rule consistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services/passports-australia).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

You can change Australian dollars at commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

Declare all amounts over $C10,000. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Credit and debit cards are widely accepted.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Canada, you may need:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP) and
* a valid Australian licence

Get an IDP before you leave Australia.

You can drive for up to one year with an IDP and your Australian licence. After that, you'll need a local driver's licence. Requirements may vary in different provinces and states.

For details see [Driving in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/driving.html).

#### Road travel

Heavy snowfalls, freezing rain and icy conditions make driving dangerous in winter. Car accidents happen more frequently in these conditions.

If you plan to drive in Canada:

* learn local traffic laws
* check [weather](https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html)
* check road conditions
* use snow tyres, which are compulsory in many provinces
* carry water, food and blankets
* drive to conditions
* don't drink and drive

Traffic laws can differ between provinces, but across Canada:

* seat belts are compulsory for everyone
* children under 40lb (18kg) must use child car seats

#### Motorcycles

You need a motorcycle licence to operate a motorcycle in Canada.

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike, ATV or similar vehicle, and always wear a helmet and make sure your passenger does too.

#### Taxis

Taxis are a safe mode of transport.

Ride-sharing options are widely available.

Use the same safety precautions you would in Australia.

#### Sea travel

Many international cruise liners visit Canada.

#### Travel to the Arctic

The Arctic is vast and remote.

Access to search and rescue, evacuation, and medical facilities may be limited. It can take several days for emergency help to arrive, especially in bad weather.

For your safety, before you book travel by ship:

* assess the on-board medical facilities
* consider any pre-existing medical conditions
* talk to cruise operators about medical arrangements
* find travel insurance that covers evacuation, medical treatment and the cost of returning home.
