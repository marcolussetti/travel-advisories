#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away
* that your insurance covers any pre-existing medical conditions

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Canada. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Contact [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html) for rules that may apply to medications you wish to take or that may be detectable in your body.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

The standard of health facilities in Canada is similar to Australia. You might not be able to access public health care unless you're a resident of a Canadian province. Walk-in clinics are found in major cities. Many doctors won't take new patients.

Expect to pay up-front for medical services.

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave Australia, and make sure it covers you for:

* the duration of your trip
* all activities you intend to undertake
* any pre-existing medical conditions
* all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation

Australia and Canada have no [reciprocal healthcare](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/reciprocal-health) agreement. This means that you aren't covered by Australian Medicare in Canada. The Australian Government won’t cover your medical costs.
