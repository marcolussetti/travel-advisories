# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

The recreational use of marijuana (cannabis) is legal in Canada, subject to local restrictions.

Make sure you know the local cannabis laws about:

* legal age
* possession
* purchase
* sharing
* impairment
* production

It's illegal to transport marijuana across Canada's international borders.

If you break the law, you can receive criminal penalties, including jail time.

#### Alcohol

Check the local legal drinking age before buying or drinking alcohol. The legal age varies across the country.

#### Other laws

Seek legal advice before entering into a surrogacy arrangement.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Canada recognises dual nationality.

If you're a Canadian dual national, you must:

* use your [Canadian passport](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/passport/apply/renew/index.asp) to enter and exit Canada
* make sure your Canadian and [Australian passports](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services") are valid for the duration of your trip
* use your Australian passport to enter and exit Australia

Dual nationals aren't eligible for an [electronic travel authorisation (eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/facts.html).

Even if you're a dual national, you may not get free health care in Canada. See [Health](/node/43)
