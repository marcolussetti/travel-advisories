# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations occur in Canada and may disrupt local public services and transport. Even those intended as peaceful may become violent with little warning.

Avoid areas where demonstrations, protests and large public gatherings occur due to the ongoing potential for unrest and violence:

* Monitor the media and traffic advisories for information and updates.
* Follow instructions of local authorities and comply with any movement restrictions or curfews.

#### Crime

The crime rate in Canada is similar to Australia.

Violent crime does occur throughout Canada, especially in large cities and other urban areas. However, tourists are rarely targeted.

Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, bag snatching, and passport theft occur in Canada. They can happen in tourist areas, hotels and on public transport. Always be alert to your surroundings and take steps to safeguard and secure your personal belongings. Avoid leaving valuables in unattended vehicles.

As in Australia, credit card [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and fraud can happen.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* look after your belongings in public
* regularly check your credit card account and report suspicious activity to your bank
* monitor local sources of information on crime

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

[Canada's Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/nationalsecurity/terrorism-threat-level.html) assesses the terrorism threat in Canada to be Medium, meaning that a violent act of terrorism could occur.

The principal terrorist threat in Canada is posed by individuals or groups inspired by violent and extremist ideologies - whether political, religious or ideological. In recent years, Canada has seen a small number of lone-actor violent incidents reportedly involving extremist ideologies.

Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners and places of worship.

To reduce your risk of being involved in a terrorist incident:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places or near known potential targets
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe to do so. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Wildlife safety

Bears and other dangerous wildlife live in forested areas.

If you plan to travel through these areas:

* get local advice before hiking
* respect wildlife laws
* maintain a safe and legal distance from all wildlife
* use reputable and professional tour operators
* follow park regulations and wardens' advice

#### Winter sports and adventures

Winter sports can be dangerous, even fatal. Injuries are common.

Avalanches can happen in mountainous regions, including Alberta and British Columbia. Always follow avalanche advice. It's unsafe to ski, snowboard or ride a Ski-Doo (snowmobile) on closed trails.

Monitor [Weather Information - Environment Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/) for forecasts, updates and severe weather alerts and warnings.

If you plan to do a winter sport or activity:

* check that it's covered by your travel insurance
* don't enter closed trails
* tell friends or family where you're going and when you expect to return
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities, including local guides or instructors
* monitor local media

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Forest fires

Several Canadian provinces have been affected by forest fires. You should monitor local media about forest fire conditions and the impact on air quality. Follow the advice of local authorities.

[Forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") are common and can get out of control, particularly in the warmer months from May to August.

#### Severe weather

Temperatures in winter (December to February) of -20 to -30°C, with a wind-chill factor 10 to 15°C lower, are common in some areas. Heavy snowfalls, rain, ice and severe cold create dangerous outdoor conditions.

Temperatures in summer (June to August) can reach more than 30°C. Humidity can make the temperature feel 10 to 15°C higher. These conditions can generate severe storms and tornadoes, especially across the provinces of:

* Alberta
* Saskatchewan
* Manitoba

[Severe weather](/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather "Severe weather") can occur year-round in Canada and cause especially hazardous conditions. Monitor [Environment Canada](http://www.weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html) for forecasts, updates and severe weather alerts and warnings.

#### Tornadoes and hurricanes

Tornadoes occur between April and September in many areas, including:

* Alberta
* the area from southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba to northwestern Ontario
* Southern and Southeastern Ontario
* Southern and Southeastern Quebec

Hurricanes occur between June and November, including in the Atlantic Provinces of:

* Newfoundland and Labrador
* New Brunswick
* Nova Scotia
* Prince Edward Island

 The direction and strength of hurricanes can change suddenly.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* flights could be delayed or suspended
* adequate shelter may not be available

Severe weather may also affect access to ports.

Prepare yourself by:

* identifying your local shelter
* knowing the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

British Columbia is in an active earthquake zone. Earthquakes have also happened in Quebec and Ontario.

Destructive tsunamis are rare but could happen if there's an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean.

If you're near the coast, move to the nearest high ground or as far inland as you can if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings.

#### After a disaster

Travelling to areas affected by natural disasters and severe weather events can be dangerous.

If you plan to travel to a region after a natural disaster, check with your transport operator that services are operating.

Contact the place you intend to stay in and check other sources for details on local conditions.
