You need a visa to enter Turkmenistan, even if you're only transiting.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Turkmen Manat (TMM).

Declare any foreign currency when you arrive and depart.

Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based economy.

Traveller's cheques are only accepted in some major hotels.

There are very few ATMs in Ashgabat, and none outside the capital city.

US dollars can be readily exchanged. Make sure banknotes are in good condition and aren't counterfeit. Only use authorised foreign exchange providers.

Converting local currency is extremely difficult. Local exchanges and hotels offer widely varying exchange rates, so exercise caution and exchange only as much as you need.

#### Local travel

#### Driving Permit

You will need both a valid Australian and International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Turkmenistan (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

#### Road travel

Road travel between regions of Turkmenistan can be restricted at short notice.

Designated restricted zones are closed to foreigners who don't have government permission. These zones include:

* regions bordering Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan
* areas of the Caspian Sea coast
* areas of Dashoguz

Road conditions and driving standards are poor.

Avalanches and landslides can make road conditions dangerous, particularly during winter and spring.

Driving at night is dangerous due to a lack of lighting.

Access to service stations can be limited in rural areas.

Random police checks and security checkpoints on roads are common. Carry certified copies of your passport and visa.

Vehicle restrictions (that may include the colour of the vehicle) can apply in downtown areas of Ashgabat, be aware of local rules.
