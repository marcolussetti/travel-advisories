#### Crime

Crime in Turkmenistan includes:

* pickpocketing
* [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [theft](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")

The risk is higher:

* on trains, particularly overnight services
* at markets

People travelling in unofficial taxis have been [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

To protect yourself from crime in taxis:

* ask staff at hotels, restaurants or places of entertainment to book a licensed taxi for you
* avoid getting into taxis that are already occupied

The risk of crime is also higher at night.

Crime risks are higher for women.

To protect yourself from crime:

* avoid travelling or walking alone, especially at night
* avoid isolated areas
* pay attention to your surroundings
* avoid using public transport
* keep valuables out of sight

Police and other local officials have reportedly harassed, mistreated and extorted foreigners. Ask for identification if you are unsure the person is an official.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that attract large groups of people can turn violent.

To stay safe during civil unrest:

* avoid large gatherings and protests
* monitor the media for possible unrest

Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of disruptions.

#### Afghanistan border

The security situation is extremely dangerous in the region bordering Afghanistan due to:

* militant activity
* clashes between militants and Afghan forces
* drug smuggling
* smuggling of other goods

The security situation could get worse without warning.

We are extremely limited in the consular help we can provide to Australians in these border regions.

If you travel to this region despite our advice, monitor local and international media for updates.
