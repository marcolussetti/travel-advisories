# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in Turkmenistan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Proof of identity

Always carry ID. Security officials often ask for proof of identity.

Internal security may target foreigners with extra security checks and increased scrutiny. Internal security may question you or search your home or car.

#### Drug laws

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They can include long prison sentences.

#### Dual citizenship

Turkmenistan doesn't recognise dual nationality. The government prohibits dual citizenship for all adults.

If you're a dual citizen and you travel on your Turkmen passport, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Australian-Turkmen dual nationals may be required to perform military service in Turkmenistan.

If you're a dual national, seek advice from an [embassy or consulate of Turkmenistan](https://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/articles/63?breadcrumbs=no) before you travel.

#### Behaviour

Obvious displays of affection, even between married couples, may offend. Police may harass or detain you. Avoid public displays of affection.
