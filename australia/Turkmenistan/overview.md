## Overview

### Safety

* Pickpocketing, mugging and theft occurs. The risk is higher on trains and at markets. Avoid going out alone, especially at night. Criminals target travellers using unofficial taxis. Always book a licensed taxi. Don't get into taxis that are already occupied.
* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Targets may include places popular with foreigners. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Demonstrations can turn violent. Avoid large gatherings and protests. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Police and other local officials have reportedly harassed, mistreated and extorted foreigners.
* Earthquakes are a higher risk in the south-west and north-east regions. Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.
* If you travel to the region bordering Afghanistan despite our advice, monitor local and international media for updates. The security situation is extremely dangerous. Consular help is extremely limited.

### Health

* Some sleeping tablets and medications containing codeine may be restricted. Check legal limits before you travel and declare all prescription medication and other restricted items on arrival.
* Infectious diseases include cholera, hepatitis, measles, tuberculosis, typhoid. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities are limited. Medicines and equipment are often in short supply. You may need to pay cash up-front to receive treatment.

### Local laws

* You must always carry ID. Security officials often ask for proof of identity. Ask for identification if you are unsure the person is an official.
* Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include long prison sentences.
* It's illegal to have same sex relationships. Obvious displays of affection, even between married couples, may offend. Police may harass or detain you.
* It's illegal to drive with a blood alcohol reading over zero percent (0%). It's illegal to smoke in restaurants, hotels and public spaces or gift tobacco.
* It's illegal to photograph sensitive sites. Take care when taking photos of infrastructure.
* Law enforcement agencies in Turkmenistan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.
* Turkmenistan doesn't recognise dual nationality. This may limit consular help we can give to dual nationals who travel on a Turkmen passport.
* Several informal restrictions have been introduced on women's appearance and behaviour. There have been some reports of women not being allowed to sit in the front seat of cars and take rides with male drivers who are not their family members.

* If you're travelling with a child, you may need evidence of parental, custodial or access rights. You may also need a letter of consent from any non-travelling parent.

* You must declare any foreign currency when you arrive and depart.
