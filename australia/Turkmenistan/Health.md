#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some sleeping tablets and medications containing codeine are controlled in Turkmenistan.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Turkmenistan. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Declare all prescription medication and other restricted items on arrival.

Ask DFAT to [authenticate](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") medical documents if needed.

You could be refused entry, prosecuted or charged if you:

* carry amounts over the legal limit
* don't have a prescription for medication you're carrying
* don't declare medication and other restricted items, even if you have a prescription

#### Health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common, including:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

Get urgent medical attention if you suspect food poisoning, or if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited in Turkmenistan.

Medicines and equipment are often in short supply.

You may need to pay cash up-front to doctors and hospitals, even for emergency care.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
