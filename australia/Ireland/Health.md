#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

Although Australia and Ireland have a reciprocal healthcare agreement, you'll still need travel insurance. If hospitalised, you may be caught out with non-medical related expenses, such as the cost of your delayed or assisted travel home.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured and covered under the reciprocal healthcare agreement, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Ireland. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

The standard of health care is similar to that in Australia.

Australia and Ireland share a reciprocal healthcare agreement. This means you can get emergency medical treatment at public hospitals in the same way Irish people can.

However, the agreement doesn't:

* allow you to get ongoing treatment for an existing condition
* replace your need for private travel insurance
* You must usually pay up-front for medical treatment.

Although Australia and Ireland share a reciprocal healthcare agreement, you'll still need travel insurance. If you're hospitalised, you may be caught out with non-medical related expenses, such as the costs of your delayed or assisted travel home.
