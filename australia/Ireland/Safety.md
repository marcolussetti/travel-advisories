# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, particularly in city centres like Dublin. Risks include bag snatching and pickpocketing.

Thieves target areas popular with tourists.

Car theft and break-ins are increasing. Thieves target rental cars, especially in Dublin and tourist areas. Use secure parking lots when possible and keep your luggage and valuables out of sight.

Watch your belongings on public transport and in crowded places.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
