#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

You don't need to apply for a tourist visa before departing Australia. A tourist visa of up to 90 days will be issued on arrival, as determined by the immigration officer.

At least one blank page in your passport is required for entry.

When you arrive, immigration authorities may ask for details of your:

* accommodation bookings
* return flights
* contacts in Ireland

If they don't believe you're a genuine tourist, they may:

* refuse to let you enter
* give you a limited-stay visa

You'll need a visa for longer visits or if you want to work or study. You'll need to apply for your visa before you leave Australia.

Ireland isn't a part of the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen) and doesn't accept Schengen visas.

If you're travelling to the UK (including Northern Ireland) from Ireland or transiting the UK on your way to Ireland, you should review the Travel Section of the travel advice for the [United Kingdom](/destinations/europe/united-kingdom "United Kingdom") for information on entry requirements.

Entry and exit requirements can change at short notice. For details about visas, customs and quarantine conditions, contact either:

* [Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service](http://www.inis.gov.ie/)
* an [embassy or consulate of Ireland](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/95)

#### Working in Ireland

If you plan to work, you'll need an employment permit.

Use the [Employment Permits Online System (EPOS)](https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/) to choose the right permit.

##### Travel with children

Immigration authorities have strict entry requirements for children aged under 18 years.

Authorities may ask the child, or adults accompanying them, for additional supporting documentation.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Euro.

Ireland is a member of the European Union (EU). If you're travelling between Ireland and any non-EU country, you must declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll have to pay a fine when you enter or leave Ireland if you:

* don't declare this money
* give incorrect information

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling between EU countries.

ATMs are widely available. Ask your bank before you leave if your card will work in Ireland.

#### Local travel

#### Tourism

Contact your provider with any complaints about tourist services or products.

If you're not satisfied with the response, contact the[Irish Tourist SOS](https://www.touristsos.ie/)for support and advice.

#### Driving permit

You can use your Australian driver's licence for up to 12 months. After this, you'll need to get an Irish licence.

Ireland and Australia have a driver's licence exchange for car and motorcycle licences, meaning that if you have an Australian licence, you can apply for an Irish licence without sitting any tests. You must apply for a [Personal Public Service (PPS) Number](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/12e6de-get-a-personal-public-service-pps-number/) before exchanging your licence.

When hiring a car, check with your hire car provider whether you need an International Driving Permit. The electronic version of your driver's licence won't be accepted.

#### Road travel

Conditions on major roads and in urban areas are good. However, hazards in country areas include:

* narrow, winding roads, particularly at night and during bad weather
* animals, farm vehicles and machinery on roads

You face serious penalties for drink driving, including heavy fines and jail sentences.

The blood alcohol limits are:

* 0.05% in most cases
* 0.02% for professional, learner and novice drivers

If you plan to drive:

* check if your travel insurance will cover you
* learn local road rules and practices
