## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime is common, particularly in urban areas and places popular with tourists. There's a moderate risk of serious violent crime. Watch your belongings, especially on public transport and in crowded places. Avoid secluded parks and unlit areas.
* Car theft and break-ins are increasing. Thieves target rental cars, mostly in Dublin and tourist areas, especially in secluded scenic locations. Use secure parking lots and keep luggage and valuables out of sight.
* Credit card fraud and ATM scams are becoming more common. Check ATMs before use. Don't use machines that look unusual.
* Large public gatherings and protests can occur in major centres, such as Dublin, and may turn violent. Avoid areas where protests and demonstrations are happening. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

* At least one blank page in your passport is required on entry.
