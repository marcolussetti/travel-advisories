#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Eritrea. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Altitude

It may take some time to adjust to the high altitude and low oxygen levels of Asmara and surrounds.

If you suffer from a heart condition or high blood pressure, get medical advice before you travel.

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/malaria/en/) occurs throughout the year in Eritrea.

Other insect-borne disease risks include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)

There are no current reports of [Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-factsheet-basics.htm) outbreaks in Eritrea. However, there have been past outbreaks in Africa.

To protect yourself against diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk for travellers. Take precautions if taking part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Polio

Outbreaks of [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) have occurred in countries across the Horn of Africa.

Check your polio vaccination status with your doctor or travel clinic at least 8 weeks before you travel. You may need a booster dose.

If you aren't vaccinated, complete the full course of vaccinations before you leave.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are widespread. These diseases include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [schistosomiasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [meningococcal disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningococcal-meningitis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food

Get urgent medical help if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Asmara has 3 public hospitals. Public hospitals in other towns have fewer facilities. Elsewhere, medical facilities are even more limited.

Medicines are often unavailable and can be expensive. Carry a full medical pack if you travel away from large towns.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
