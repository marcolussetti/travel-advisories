#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

The Australian Government may not be able to provide consular help if you're detained in Eritrea. Eritrean authorities don't always tell the relevant embassy when foreign nationals need consular help.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Eritrea. The [Australian Embassy in Cairo](https://egypt.embassy.gov.au/) provides consular services to Australians in Eritrea.

Australian consular officials often face long delays in getting visas to enter Eritrea or to travel outside of Asmara. These delays severely limit consular help to Australians in Eritrea, especially outside of Asmara.

The Eritrean authorities may not inform the relevant Embassy if a foreign national is in need of help and there have been recent instances where the Eritrean authorities have refused consular access to foreign nationals.

If you need consular help, contact the [Australian Embassy in Cairo](https://egypt.embassy.gov.au/).
