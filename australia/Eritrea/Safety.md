# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

There's a risk of political instability in Eritrea. However, Asmara is relatively stable.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Avoid demonstrations and protests. Monitor the media for news that may affect your security and safety. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Ethiopian border

In response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia, the Eritrean Government called for a mobilisation of its armed forces in September 2022. While the mobilisation has ceased, additional security measures may be introduced at short notice. You should remain vigilant.

In 2020, there were reports of explosions in Asmara as a result of rockets launched from the ongoing military conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia. Further attacks are possible. Exercise extreme caution and follow the advice of local authorities.

Eritrea has extensive unmarked minefields, mainly near the border with Ethiopia. Don't travel within 25km of the border.

All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed. Travellers should check local advice before proceeding to the border.

It's not clear where or to what extent de-mining has taken place. Walking and hiking in rural areas may be dangerous.

In most places, the border is neither marked nor obvious.

There's a high threat of [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and violence from bandits and insurgents, including bomb attacks. There are ongoing reports of armed groups operating in and around the border area.

#### Djibouti border

Conflict and instability between Eritrea and Djibouti since 2008 create a high risk within 25km of the border.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping is a risk in Eritrea.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to an area where there's a risk of kidnapping:

* seek professional security advice
* arrange effective personal security

#### Crime

Street crime is rare but happens in cities and towns, including Asmara. Don't walk around alone late at night.

[Robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and violence may occur:

* near the Djibouti border where law and order has broken down
* along the coast north of Massawa
* on some rural roads

Many local people access weapons under the government's civilian militia program. There's no evidence that these weapons have increased the threat of violent crime.

#### Piracy

There's a significant threat of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.

Pirates have attacked vessels and held foreigner's hostage for ransom in the Gulf of Aden.

Somali pirates have attacked vessels more than a thousand nautical miles (1850km) from the coast of Somalia.

Attractive targets for Somali pirates include:

* commercial vessels
* pleasure craft
* luxury cruise liners

You should remain out of the [designated High-Risk Area](https://www.mscio.eu/) or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.

If you need to travel by boat to Eritrea's waters and surrounds:

* stay more than a thousand nautical miles (1850km) from the coast of the Horn of Africa, even this distance may not be safe
* travel in a convoy and maintain good communication
* take appropriate security measures

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

No recent terrorist attacks have occurred in Eritrea, but they can happen.

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Eritrea is in an active [volcano](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone.

Get information on natural disasters from the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/). If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of local authorities.
