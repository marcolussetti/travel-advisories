## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the region are ongoing and tensions remain high along all border fronts between Eritrea and neighbouring countries of Ethiopia and Sudan.
* Tensions remain high between Eritrea and Ethiopia, with an increased risk of missile/rocket attacks in Eritrea. Additional security measures may be introduced at short notice.
* Don't travel within 25km of the border. Landmines are found within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Ethiopia. Walking or hiking in rural areas is dangerous due to the security situation and unmarked minefields.
* Since the outbreak of war in Sudan in 2023 there has been an influx of Sudanese refugees into Eritrea, putting a further strain on limited Eritrean infrastructure and resources.
* Military tensions exist between Eritrea and Djibouti. Robbery and violence are common within 25km of the border.
* There's a risk of kidnapping in Eritrea. If you choose to travel to high-risk regions, get professional security advice. You should remain vigilant when in Eritrea.
* Robbery and violence are common along the coast north of Massawa and on some rural roads. Take care when travelling in these areas.

### Health

* Parts of Eritrea, including Asmara, are at high altitudes. This can lead to altitude sickness. If you have a heart condition or high blood pressure, get medical advice before you travel.
* Malaria occurs throughout the year. Yellow fever is also a risk. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Get vaccinated for yellow fever before you travel. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue fever and filariasis. Use insect repellent. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take precautions if you're doing anything that might expose you to infection.
* Polio outbreaks have occurred across the Horn of Africa. Check your vaccination status with a doctor before you travel. Other infectious diseases include cholera and hepatitis. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked foods.
* There are currently drinking water supply problems being experienced across Eritrea due to the closure by the Eritrean Government of many of the water purification and bottling plants. You should be aware of this shortage when planning your visit.
* Medications are often unavailable and can be expensive. Carry a comprehensive medical pack if you travel away from large towns.

### Local laws

* Serious crimes may attract the death penalty or physical punishment.
* Understand local laws. Same-sex relationships and taking photos of government buildings or military sites are illegal.
* Eritrea doesn't recognise dual nationality. Male dual nationals may need to enter military service when they return to Eritrea. Get advice from the nearest [embassy or consulate of Eritrea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/64/State) before you travel.
* Eritrea has strict standards of dress and behaviour. Dress appropriately.

### Travel

* You'll need a visa to enter Eritrea. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Eritrea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/64/State) for the latest details.
* Carry your yellow fever vaccination certificate. You may need to show it when you arrive in and leave Eritrea.
* You need an exit permit to leave Eritrea. It can take a long time to get one. Apply well before your departure date.
* You need a permit to travel beyond 25km of Asmara and the surrounding province of Zoba Maekel. Apply before you travel. Permits usually take around 24 hours to process.
* There are no ATMs in Eritrea. You can't use credit cards, except in some hotels. Check with your hotel before travelling to find out the best way to pay. Change foreign currency at a branch of the state foreign currency exchange in Himbol. It's illegal to use foreign currencies or to change foreign currency anywhere else.
* Tourists may not be able to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara. You may need to rent a car or use a private taxi.

### Local contacts

* The [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") tells you what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.
* The Australian Government may not be able to provide consular help if you're detained in Eritrea. Eritrean authorities don't always tell the relevant embassy when foreign nationals need consular help.
* Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Eritrea. If you need consular help, contact the [Australian Embassy in Cairo](https://egypt.embassy.gov.au/).
* Australian consular officials often face long delays in getting visas to enter Eritrea or to travel outside of Asmara. These delays severely limit consular help to Australians in Eritrea, especially outside of Asmara.
* If you choose to travel, be aware consular services may be limited due to local measures.
