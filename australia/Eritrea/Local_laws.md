# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

In the past, Eritrean authorities have refused consular access to detained foreigners.

The Australian Government may not be able to provide fast or full consular help to Australians held in Eritrea.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug-related crimes are severe and include long prison sentences.

#### Other laws

Serious crimes may attract the death penalty or physical punishment.

In Eritrea it's illegal to:

* have same-sex relations
* take photos of government buildings or military sites
* change money anywhere other than at a branch of the state foreign currency exchange in Himbol
* use foreign currency, except in some hotels

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when youâ€™re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Eritrea doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Australian males who hold Eritrean citizenship may need to enter military service when they return to Eritrea.

Dual nationals who enter on an Eritrean identity card rather than an Eritrean passport will need an exit visa from the Immigration Office in Asmara.

If you're an Eritrean-Australian dual national, get advice from the nearest [embassy or consulate of Eritrea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/64/State) before you travel.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are strict in Eritrea. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, ask for local advice.
