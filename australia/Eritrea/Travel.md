#### Visa and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You'll need a visa to enter Eritrea.

Entry and exit requirements can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Eritrea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/64/State) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

International flights into and from Asmara are limited. Check with your airline.

#### Exit permit

You need an exit permit to leave Eritrea. It can take a long time to get one. The Immigration Department may deny you a permit.

The Australian Government cannot influence the Eritrean Immigration Department to issue exit permits.

You must pay a departure tax in US dollars. You're exempt if you hold a valid Eritrean resident permit. Ask local authorities about the cost of the departure tax because the amount may change.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Eritrea, especially if you're arriving from a country where yellow fever is common. You'll also need to have one when you leave.

Most countries ask for proof of yellow fever vaccination if you arrive from Eritrea and other yellow fever risk countries. This includes [Egypt](/destinations/africa/egypt "Egypt") and [South Africa](/destinations/africa/south-africa "South Africa").

#### Electronic devices

Declare all electronic items when you arrive. These include:

* laptops
* mobile phones
* cameras
* other electronic equipment

If you don't declare them, Eritrean customs officials could confiscate the items when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Local currency

The local currency is the Eritrean Nafka (ERN). Currency controls are in place.

There's no limit to the amount of foreign currency you can bring into the country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. Make sure you have had your complete foreign currency declaration form approved and stamped before you leave the airport.

Any foreign currency used in Eritrea must be exchanged or used legally. You must have proof of this when you leave.

#### Access to money

Eritrea's economy is completely cash-based. There are no credit card or ATM facilities in Eritrea. You'll need to pay for everything in cash.

It's illegal to change money anywhere other than at a branch of the state foreign currency exchange in one of the 'Himbol' exchanges in town. Some officially recognised hotels can accept foreign currency. Otherwise, it's illegal to use foreign currencies in Eritrea.

You can't take more than 500 Nafka out of Eritrea. Authorities could prosecute you if you do. Nakfa aren’t convertible outside Eritrea. You should convert any excess Nakfa back to hard currency at one of the 'Himbol' exchanges in town, as there are limits to what can be converted at the 'Himbol' branch at the airport. You will need the original currency transaction receipt.

#### Local travel

#### Phone coverage

Landline, mobile telephone and internet services are unreliable. Internet is available at some international hotels and internet cafes in Asmara.

Local SIM cards aren't available to non-residents.

Eritrean mobile phone providers don't have agreements with international providers. International roaming may not be available.

Contact your telecommunication provider before travelling.

#### Travel permits

You must apply ahead for a travel permit to travel 25km outside of Asmara and the surrounding province of Zoba Maekel. Ministries in Asmara process applications.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry handles business travel applications.

The Ministry of Tourism on Harnet Avenue in Asmara handles tourist travel applications.

Apply in advance as processing applications may take several days.

When applying for permission to travel outside of Asmara, give details of your car.

If you're living or working outside of Asmara and want to travel outside your normal area of work or home, you need a travel permit. Apply at your local Zonal Administration Office. Travel applications can take several days to process. Sometimes they're refused or delayed.

Our consular services are severely limited outside Asmara. This includes emergency assistance. Australian consular officials often face long delays to get visas to enter Eritrea. Once in Eritrea, Australian officials must then apply for a permit to travel outside Asmara.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Eritrea, you must get an International Driving Permit (IDP) before you arrive. Otherwise, contact local authorities to get a local licence.

#### Road travel

There are extensive mine fields in Eritrea, especially in border areas. Driving on main roads outside of border areas is generally safe. Driving on rural roads and off-road driving can be dangerous. Avoid travel after dark in rural areas. Road signage and barriers are scarce, and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.

Roads are sealed between the cities of Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Baretun and Keren. Roads leading to smaller villages are unsealed.

Road maintenance isn't consistent in mountainous regions and steep sloping areas. Narrow winding roads with crumbling edges often don't have safety barriers.

#### Motorcycles

Avoid using motorcycles, particularly in rural areas where standards of driving and road maintenance are lower.

Check with your travel insurer to see if your policy covers riding a motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only licensed taxis or reputable limousine services. You can arrange this through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Maintenance standards on buses may be lower than in Australia.

Travellers are sometimes not allowed to use public transport to travel outside of Asmara. You may need to rent a car or use a private taxi.

#### Sea travel

Before you arrive, you must get permission and an entry visa to arrive in Eritrea by sea.

Commercial vessels that don't have agreements with Eritrean authorities should avoid Eritrean territorial waters. The Eritrean government has taken control of ships that didn't have an agreement. This has led to lengthy detention for international crew members.

Piracy is a high threat in the coastal areas of Eritrea. Pirate attacks happen against all forms of vessels in and around Eritrea's waters and the Gulf of Aden.

All forms of shipping are attractive targets for Somali pirates, including commercial vessels, yachts and luxury cruise liners. Stay alert and take extra precautions when anywhere near these waters.

#### Air travel

We can't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
