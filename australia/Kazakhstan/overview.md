## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a threat across Central Asia including in Kazakhstan. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Foreigners have been a target. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather. Take official warnings seriously.
* While the security situation is stable, in 2022, violent protests occurred in Almaty and other regions of Kazakhstan, leading to injuries and deaths. Continue to be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests. See our advice on what to do when [there's a demonstration or civil unrest](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/demonstration) nearby, monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Overland border crossings by road or train to neighbouring countries, especially in winter, may not be possible or safe, and access to fuel may be limited. Stay updated on new security risks and accessibility to the border regions.
* Theft, pickpocketing, bag-snatching, assaults, drink spiking, and carjacking can occur, particularly to foreign travellers. The risk of crime increases at night, and avoid walking alone at night. Monitor the media for new safety risks. Never leave your drink or food unattended.
* Expats have been the victims of violent attacks and muggings. Criminals have targeted expat communities in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan.
* Thieves posing as police officers or 'meet-and-greet' drivers at airports have robbed travellers. If you can, pre-arrange your own transport. If approached by a police officer, driver or official, ask to see their ID.

### Health

* Ticks are common in forested areas, especially from Spring to Autumn. Tick bites can expose you to disease. Regularly check your body for ticks during and after visits to forest areas.
* Declare all prescription medication and other restricted items on arrival. You could face charges if you don't declare medication or if you exceed the legal limit.
* HIV/AIDS is prevalent. Take precautions if engaging in activities that expose you to the virus.
* Other infectious diseases include typhoid, hepatitis, haemorrhagic fever, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leishmaniasis and rabies. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid ice cubes in rural areas. Avoid unpasteurised dairy products and raw or undercooked food. If an animal bites or scratches you, get immediate medical help.
* Medical facilities in Kazakhstan are below Australian standards. Basic drugs and equipment are in short supply. You may need to pay up-front for treatment, including for emergency care.

### Local laws

* Be careful when taking photos or videos. It's illegal to take photos of airport facilities, near military and security establishments and near border areas. It's also illegal to take photos near some official buildings. Some places, including larger shops and supermarkets, ban photography. You may be arrested if you are recording protest activity.
* Penalties for drug offences and serious crimes, such as murder, are severe and may attract long prison sentences, including life sentences.
* You may need to get official documents before you travel if you plan to live or work for long periods in Kazakhstan or you plan to marry there. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/101) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/101/State) of Kazakhstan before you travel.
* Always carry your passport or a certified copy with your registration. Identity checks by police are common.
* It's illegal to drive if your blood alcohol exceeds 0%.
* Law enforcement agencies in Kazakhstan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.
* Kazakhstan doesn't recognise dual nationality. Authorities may treat you as a Kazakh citizen, regardless of your Australian passport. This can limit the consular services we can provide. If you're an Australian-Kazakh dual national, you might have to undertake national service if you visit Kazakhstan. Find out about possible implications before you travel.
