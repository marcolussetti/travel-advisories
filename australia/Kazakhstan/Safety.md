# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime and assault

Theft, pickpocketing, bag-snatching and assaults occur, particularly to foreign travellers. They can happen:

* on public transport
* in parks
* in shopping areas
* at open markets, including the Green Market in Almaty
* at restaurants
* near major tourist hotels and nightclubs, especially in the Almaty region

The risk of crime increases at night.

To lessen your risk:

* keep an eye on your belongings
* avoid walking alone at night
* monitor the media for new safety or security risks

#### Food and drink spiking

There are reports of thieves drugging and [robbing](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") travellers in nightclubs and bars in Almaty.

To reduce your risk of food and drink spiking:

* never leave your drinks or food unattended
* don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new friends

#### Crime targeting expats and travellers

Criminals have targeted the expat community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan in the past. Expats have been the victims of violent attacks and [muggings](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Carjackings have been reported.

Thieves posing as police officers or 'meet-and-greet' drivers at airports have robbed travellers. Official taxi drivers and police officers have ID.

To stay safe when using cars and taxis:

* if you can, pre-arrange your transport
* avoid taking unofficial taxis or taxis that have other passengers
* always keep car doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* if a police officer, taxi driver or official approaches you, ask to see their ID

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

While the security situation is stable, in 2022, violent protests occurred in Almaty and other regions of Kazakhstan, leading to injuries and deaths.

To stay safe during civil unrest:

* be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests
* monitor the media for possible unrest and avoid those areas
* follow the advice of local authorities and security announcements

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Authorities will arrest both participants and bystanders, even for non-violent demonstrations.

Overland border crossing by road or train to neighbouring countries, especially in winter, may not be possible or safe, and access to fuel may be limited. In the past, there have been tensions around the border with the Kyrgyz Republic. Security issues could emerge if tensions intensify.

If you plan to travel between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic:

* monitor the media and local sources
* keep up to date on new security risks in the border regions

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat across Central Asia, including in Kazakhstan. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Foreigners have been a target. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.
