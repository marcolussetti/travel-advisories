#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

Before you travel:

* check the dates your visa is valid
* any rules or restrictions

Visa-free entry is available for Australians. You can stay in Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 calendar days on each entry. The number of visits is unlimited, but the total period of stay should not exceed 90 calendar days within a 180-day period. You're not allowed to work under the visa-free arrangement.

The host individual or accommodation provider is responsible for registering travellers within three working days of their arrival at the address. This includes family and friends and all forms of accommodation operators. Check that this has been done on your behalf. See the [Visa and Migration portal](https://vmp.gov.kz/en) for details.

If you overstay your visa or breach your visa conditions, authorities may fine, jail or deport you.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/101) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/101/State) of Kazakhstan for details about visas, currency and customs.

#### Longer stays requiring a visa

You should contact your nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/101) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/101/State) of Kazakhstan for further information.

Make sure you have the right visa for the purpose of your travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of your visa and any associated restrictions carefully before you travel.

Anyone who has overstayed their visa needs to apply to the local migration service for an extension and may have to pay a fine.

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

If you're travelling to Kazakhstan, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months beyond the expiry date of your visa. Your passport should also have at least one blank page for your visa.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Border regions

Do not cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally. Overland border crossing by road or train to neighbouring countries, especially in winter, may not be possible or safe, and access to fuel may be limited.

Strict border controls apply to road travel between Almaty in Kazakhstan and Bishkek in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Crossing the land border between the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan by car can be slow. Customs checks can create long delays.

The border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan may close for short periods. Before you go, check with the [Kazakhstan Border Service (Russian)](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/shekaraknb?lang=en).

To drive in Kazakhstan, you need both:

* a valid driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a car accident in Kazakhstan than in Australia. Hazards include:

* poor road conditions
* poor driving standards
* lack of street lighting
* pedestrians crossing streets with no warning
* snow and ice on roads during winter

Cars often don't give way to pedestrians on roads.

In rural areas, animals on roads are another hazard.

It may be difficult to access service stations in rural areas. Fuel shortages happen sometimes.

If you plan to drive:

* check your travel insurance covers it
* learn local traffic laws and driving practices
* beware of animals on the roads
* look out for pedestrians crossing streets without warning
* avoid travel at night, especially in rural areas
