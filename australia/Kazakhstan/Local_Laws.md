# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in Kazakhstan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties are severe for carrying, using or trafficking in illegal drugs. They can include prison sentences and heavy fines.

#### Photography

It's illegal to take photos:

* of airport facilities
* near military and security establishments
* near border areas
* near some official buildings
* in premises where there are bans on photography, including many larger shops and supermarkets

Bans apply even if there are no notices banning photography.

#### Living and working in Kazakhstan

You may need to get official documents before you go to Kazakhstan if:

* you plan to live or work there for long periods
* you plan to [get married](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") there

Kazakhstan will only recognise an Australian-issued document if it is [authenticated](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-services/apostilles-authentications-certificates-of-no-impediment-to-marriage/Pages/apostilles-authentications-and-certificates-of-no-impediment-to-marriage.aspx). Find out what you need to do from an [embassy or consulate of Kazakhstan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/101) before you travel.

You need an official letter of no objection from the [Australian Embassy in Moscow](http://www.russia.embassy.gov.au/) if you plan to either:

* apply for a Kazakh residency permit, or
* get married in Kazakhstan

#### Other laws

Identity checks by police are common.

Always carry your passport and your registration. A certified copy, including your registration, is usually sufficient.

It's illegal to drive if your blood alcohol reading is over 0%.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Kazakhstan doesn't recognise dual nationality. Authorities may treat you as a Kazakh citizen, regardless of your Australian passport. This can limit the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) we can provide.

If authorities find out about a second nationality, they may:

* restrict your entry
* rescind your Kazakh nationality

If you're an Australian-Kazakh dual national, you might have to do national service if you visit Kazakhstan.

In deciding which passport to travel on, think about:

* the possible implications for your Kazakh citizenship
* your national service obligations
* your ability to access Australian consular help if authorities arrest or detain you

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in Kazakhstan.

Same-sex relationships are legal, but not widely accepted.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, dress and behave conservatively and seek local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Kazakhstan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
