#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Benin. The availability of some medicines may be restricted. Carry enough for your entire stay.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) is common in Benin. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel. You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Benin. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) and other tropical diseases are common in Benin and other West African countries.

To protect yourself from disease:

* check your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases occur in Benin. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [lassa fever](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/lassa-fever/en/)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

If you swim in fresh water, you may be exposed to waterborne diseases.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is generally poor. Medical facilities in major towns have limited services and may not have English-speaking staff available. Rural areas may have very basic care or none at all.

Doctors and hospitals usually need you to pay before they will treat you. If you can't pay, they'll often delay your treatment.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to somewhere with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
