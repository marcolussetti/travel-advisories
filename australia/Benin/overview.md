## Overview

### Safety

* Violent crime is common in Benin, especially in Cotonou and regions bordering Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria. Robberies, carjackings and pickpocketing also occur. Don't walk alone after dark, particularly in poorly lit areas, on the beach or in the vicinity of Dantokpa market.
* Terrorist activity and kidnappings have occurred in Benin, particularly in the northern departments of Atakora, Alibori and Borgou, do not travel to these areas. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Reconsider your need to travel to the border area with Nigeria, south of the Department of Borgou, due to the risk of terrorist attacks and kidnapping.
* [Scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) and internet fraud are common in West African countries. Scam victims often lose money. Be wary of messages from people you don't know. Don't travel to Benin to meet someone you have only interacted with online.
* During rainy season, [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident) and flooding can damage bridges and roads. Depending on the region, the rainy seasons can happen from April to October. Monitor the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) for updates.

### Health

* Yellow fever, malaria and other tropical diseases are common. Get a yellow fever vaccination before you travel, and consider taking medication to prevent malaria. Use insect repellent.
* HIV/AIDS infection rates are high. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.
* Infectious diseases can occur. There were hundreds of cases of cholera in 2016. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Avoid ice cubes, raw and undercooked food.
* Medical facilities in major towns are limited. Rural areas may have very basic care or none at all. A medical evacuation will be required if you're seriously ill or injured. English-speaking medical staff may not be available.

### Local laws

* It's illegal to take photos of government buildings, military zones, assets and personnel.
* Benin recognises dual nationality. If you're a dual national, you may have to perform civil or military service in Benin. Check with an [embassy or consulate of Benin](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/25) before you travel. Always travel on your Australian passport.
* Benin is very conservative. Take care not to offend.
* Same-sex relationships aren't illegal, but locals are often intolerant of them. Avoid open displays of affection.

### Travel

* Visas are restricted. You can apply [online](https://evisa.bj/#) for a short-stay single or multiple-entry e-visa. You'll need to pay a fee to apply for a visa. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Benin for the latest details.
* You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Benin. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.
* It's difficult to exchange Australian dollars for West African CFA Francs. The economy is mainly cash-based, credit cards may not work, and ATMs are rare outside major centres. Plan ahead and take enough cash to meet your needs.
* Driving in regional Benin can be dangerous due to poorly maintained roads and low driving standards. Unofficial checkpoints and highway bandits are common. Avoid driving at night. Stay alert if you do drive. Keep doors and windows locked, even when you're driving.
* Criminal activity happens, particularly in border regions. Do not travel to Benin's border region with Burkina Faso and Niger. Do not travel to the Benin-Nigeria border in the departments of Alibori and Borgou. Reconsider your need to travel to the Benin-Nigeria border south of the Department of Borgou. Border crossings may close at short notice.
* Boat travel can be dangerous. [Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) and armed robbery at sea happen in coastal areas of Benin.
