# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include long prison sentences and heavy fines.

#### Dual citizenship

Benin recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, you may have to perform civil or military service in Benin. Check with an [embassy or consulate of Benin](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/25) before you travel.

Always travel on your Australian passport.

#### Local customs

Benin is very conservative. Take care not to offend.

Ask for permission before you take someone's photo.

Politely and firmly say no to officials who ask for gifts in return for help.

Same-sex relationships are legal, but locals often don't accept them.
