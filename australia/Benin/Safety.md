#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is common, especially in Cotonou and regions bordering Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria.

Crimes include robberies and carjackings. Carjacking occurs more often at night.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, like pickpocketing, is common in markets in Cotonou and near:

* hotels
* ports
* bus stations

Criminals often target bars, restaurants and tourist spots. Avoid walking alone after dark in poorly lit areas, on the beach or in the vicinity of Dantokpa market.

To stay safe:

* don't walk alone after dark or in poorly lit areas
* keep valuable items such as expensive jewellery or mobile phones out of sight
* watch out for drivers or pedestrians who act suspiciously
* keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* avoid leaving your belongings unattended.

#### Scams and fraud

Scammers usually operate in one of two ways.

They may ask their friend or prospective marriage partner to send them money to travel to Australia. After they get the money, they end the relationship.

Victims rarely get their money back. If you travel to the scammer's country to meet someone or get money back, you risk [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping"), [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and robbery. Sometimes scam victims are killed.

Commercial internet fraud is common in West African countries.

Internet [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") may offer romance, friendship, business or job offers.

Criminals might:

* ask you to transfer large amounts of money into a 'safe' bank account as a donation or for a percentage
* give fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* make fake job offers
* steal money from someone they've invited to Africa for business

Friendship, dating and marriage scams often start on internet dating sites or chat rooms.

To avoid scams:

* be wary of messages from people you don't know in Benin (or other West African countries)
* do your research before you send money to anyone in Benin

If you're the victim of a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Benin to get your money back.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

In recent years, terrorists have attacked northern Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria.

A terror attack could happen anywhere, including places foreigners go.

To stay safe from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities

If an attack happens, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area because further attacks may follow.

The risk of terrorist activity is very high in northern Benin, including in the W and Pendjari National Parks. Do not travel to the northern departments of Atakora, Alibori or Borgou.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Terrorist groups within the region have kidnapped foreigners in northern Benin and neighbouring Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria.

The risk of kidnapping is very high in northern Benin, including in Pendjari and W National Parks. Do not travel to this region. Conflict in this region is ongoing, and foreigners have been targeted in the past.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To reduce your risk:

* avoid protests, rallies and crowds
* monitor the media and other sources for possible action

#### Swimming safety

Strong ocean currents occur along the coast. Many people drown each year.

Get advice from locals before swimming. Don't swim alone.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Severe weather

Benin experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/node/347), including flooding and seasonal winds.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* follow advice from local authorities
* stay in contact with friends and family

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Flooding

In the south, the rainy seasons are April to July and September to October. In the north, the rainy season is June to September.

During rainy seasons, severe weather and flooding can damage bridges and roads.

#### Seasonal wind

Benin experiences a seasonal wind called the Harmattan from December to March. This wind blows sand and dust into the air, which may limit what you can see.
