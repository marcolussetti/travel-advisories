#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

If you hold an Australian passport, to enter Benin, you need a visa and meet yellow fever requirements.

You can [apply online](https://evisa.bj/#), for a fee, for a short stay single or multiple entry e-visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Benin](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/25) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Benin. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia after exposure to [yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the West African CFA Franc.

Benin's economy is cash-based. ATMs are rare outside major centres. Many businesses don't accept credit cards.

It's hard to exchange Australian dollars in Benin. You can exchange US dollars and euros at commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

Plan ahead and take enough cash to meet your needs.

Contact your bank to check you can access your money in Benin.

Credit and debit card fraud is common.

#### Local travel

#### Border areas

Do not travel to Benin's border region with Burkina Faso and Niger. Do not travel to the Benin-Nigeria border in the departments of Alibori and Borgou. Reconsider your need to travel to the Benin-Nigeria border south of the Department of Borgou.

If you travel to Benin's border regions, despite our advice, be aware that border crossings can close at short notice. Check with local authorities before travelling.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Benin with:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a road accident in Benin than in Australia.

Driving hazards include:

* poor road conditions
* poor street lighting
* overloaded vehicles
* people or animals on roads

Criminal activity, unofficial checkpoints and highway bandits are common.

Most roads outside of Cotonou are unsealed and poorly maintained. Some unsealed roads are unusable during the rainy seasons.

Fuel shortages are common in rural areas of northern Benin.

Police sometimes check vehicles at temporary roadblocks. They may ask for your ID and vehicle registration papers.

Witnesses to road accidents can react strongly towards people they think are at fault.

To stay safe on the road:

* learn about local traffic laws and practices before driving
* always carry copies of ID, vehicle registration, and ownership papers
* avoid driving at night
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when driving

If you travel to rural areas, take extra fuel, drinking water and first aid supplies.

#### Motorcycles

Ensure your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines. It's best to arrange them through your hotel.

#### Public transport

There is no reliable public transport in Benin.

Avoid long-distance buses. They're poorly maintained and often overloaded.

#### Boat travel

Travelling on boats can be dangerous. Safety standards are often low. Boats may not have lifesaving equipment, and operators may not be licenced by authorities.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) and [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) at sea happen in coastal areas of Benin. Pirates have attacked large vessels in waters off Benin and nearby countries.

Smugglers and traffickers routinely use internal waterways between Nigeria and Benin to evade border controls.
