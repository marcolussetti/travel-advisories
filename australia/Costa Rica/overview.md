### Safety

* Violent crime, including carjackings and 'express kidnappings', is increasingly common in Costa Rica. Criminals often target tourist areas, resorts, transport hubs and public transport. Be aware of your surroundings. Plan to arrive or leave the airport during daylight hours.
* Petty crime is common. Avoid carrying valuables where possible. Use established tour operators and officially registered taxis.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave your drinks unattended, especially in stores or bars. Drink spiking and methanol poisoning are common and have killed people.
