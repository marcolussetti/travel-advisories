# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, particularly pickpocketing and bag snatching. Thieves often target overhead compartments on buses.

Unattended vehicles are targeted:

* in downtown San José
* near beaches
* in national parks
* around tourist areas

To keep your belongings safe:

* use established tour operators and registered taxis
* be aware of your surroundings and personal security

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is common in Costa Rica, including:

* armed robberies
* carjackings
* home invasions
* gang muggings

Travellers have been the target of armed robberies or drug-related crimes.

Criminals often target:

* tourist attractions
* resorts
* airports
* bus stations and public transport
* harbours, especially Limon and Puntarenas ports

If you use an unofficial taxi, there's a risk of [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault").

Women are at risk of [sexual harassment and assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), particularly when alone on a beach or in a taxi.

Be alert to drink spiking with any drink bought in a store or bar. Don't leave drinks unattended. Make sure the brand is known, and watch your drinks being made. Drink spiking with methanol is common and has killed people.

Take care in San José, particularly after dark. High-risk areas for theft include:

* the Coca-Cola bus station
* inner downtown areas
* public parks
* roads leading to the San José International Airport

Take care in other areas of Costa Rica, including:

* Jaco
* Quepos
* Manuel Antonio
* Tarcoles River
* Puerto Viejo, Puerto Limónand Cahuita

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don’t walk outside or travel after dark
* pay close attention to your surroundings
* make sure your accommodation is secure
* avoid openly changing large amounts of money at border crossings
* don't travel alone or after dark
* don't use ATMs on the street

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Armed criminals may injure or kill you.

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get immediate medical attention. Costa Rica has a moderate [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection risk.

#### Other crimes

Road-based crime is common. Criminals who target vehicles may:

* stage accidents and rob you when your car stops
* slash your car tyres and offer to help with repairs while a partner steals from the car

Carjackings happen, often at gunpoint. Criminals target stationary cars and rental vehicles for robberies.

In tourist areas, you can get help from the tourist police. See Local contacts section.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government’s longstanding policy is that it doesn’t make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Express kidnappings can occur in urban areas, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Costa Rica. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave your drinks unattended, especially in stores or bars. Drink spiking and methanol poisoning are common and have killed people. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It’s illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Costa Rica.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* Avoid demonstrations, protests, and public gatherings
* Check the media for reports of unrest

#### Swimming safety

Strong coastal currents and rip tides occur on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. These can make swimming dangerous.

You may not find lifeguards on public beaches. You also may not see warning signs for dangerous conditions.

Crocodile attacks have been reported on the Pacific Coast.

Get local advice before swimming.

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/).

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
