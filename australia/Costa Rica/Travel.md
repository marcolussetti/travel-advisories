#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

On an Australian passport, you don't need a visa for a tourist visit of less than 90 days.

You might be refused entry if you can't show that you'll return home or travel onwards.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the [Embassy of Costa Rica](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/49) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other requirements

You must pay a departure tax to leave Costa Rica. This might be included in your airline ticket. 

At airports, you can pay with US dollars or Costa Rican Colones (CRC), in cash or by credit card.

At other border crossings, you can pay at Bancredito kiosks.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, ensure you meet all US entry or transit requirements.

#### Travelling with children

If you're[travelling with children](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/who-you-are/children), you may need to show proof of your legal relationship. This could be as a parent, custodian or someone with access rights.

A child travelling on a Costa Rican passport without 1 or both parents must have written consent from the absent parents to leave the country. [The Costa Rican Ministry of Migration and Foreigners](https://www.migracion.go.cr/SitePages/Inicio.aspx) must sign these documents.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

Depending on which countries you have visited, you may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Costa Rica. Airlines may require you to show this certificate before departure.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services/passports-australia).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Costa Rican Colon (CRC).

You can't exchange Australian money in Costa Rica but you can exchange US dollars.

Credit cards are widely accepted.

#### Local travel

#### Tours and adventure activities

Take care if you're taking part in [adventure activities](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"), such as:

* whitewater rafting
* bungee jumping
* scuba diving
* jungle canopy tours

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

You can drive for up to 3 months with your Australian driver's licence. If your Australian licence allows, you can drive a car and motorcycle.

#### Road travel

Stick to sealed roads and well-travelled paths.

[Road safety and driving](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety") in Costa Rica can be dangerous.

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Costa Rica than in Australia.

Driving standards can change across the country. Car insurance is essential.

If you're in an accident, call 911 for the national police or the fire brigade. Wait for the authorities to arrive before you leave.

Roads between tourist locations are usually in good or acceptable condition.

Locals sometimes steal manhole covers, leaving large holes in the road.

Roads are unsealed in isolated areas, so a 4WD vehicle is a good choice.

If you plan to drive in Costa Rica:

* check your insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* lock doors and keep car windows up, even when moving
* avoid travel at night

Try not to drive at night. Lock doors, keep windows up and take safety precautions. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/el-salvador#safety)

#### Taxis

Official taxis are red and have a yellow triangle on their side panels.

Official airport taxis are orange. You can buy prepaid vouchers for airport taxis in front of the San José airport terminal.

If you use an unofficial taxi, there's a risk of [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) and assault.

Arrange transport through your hotel, and book in advance if travelling at night.
