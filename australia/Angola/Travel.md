#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

You don't need a visa to visit Angola as a tourist. You can enter as a tourist for 30 days, with a maximum of 90 days per year. For all other travel, apply for a visa online with Angola's [Serviço de Migração](http://www.smevisa.gov.ao/).

Renewing a work visa can take at least 10 weeks. While you wait, Angolan authorities may keep your passport. You won't be able to travel. Plan ahead to avoid complications.

Penalties for visa offences include fines, detention and deportation.

While tourist visas are no longer required, border processes are still undertaken at road and air entry points. Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact an [Angolan embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/9) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Angola. Some airlines want to see one when you leave.

Check yellow fever requirements for other countries you are visiting.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Travel via South Africa

South Africa's borders are open. Confirm your travel arrangements directly with your travel provider.

If you're able to travel from Angola to or through South Africa, you must meet South African entry and transit requirements. 

South Africa has specific requirements for:

* [children who are travelling](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children")
* proof of yellow fever vaccination

It won't accept [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents), such as 1-page travel documents.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country with two blank pages. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months with two blank pages.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Angola is the Angolan Kwanza.

ATMs can be hard to find in Angola.

If you have amounts over USD10,000, declare it on entry. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Travellers can take up to USD10,000 out of Angola. Different rules apply to residents.

#### Local travel

#### Proof of identity

Always carry your identity documents.

Photocopies are only valid if an Angolan Notary Public notarises them.

Police and military checkpoints are common. You can be fined if you fail to produce valid proof of identity.

#### Travel conditions

Travel outside Luanda can be difficult and dangerous.

Infrastructure is heavily damaged from Angola's 27-year civil war.

Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are a danger:

* outside major cities
* in the interior of the country
* in areas bordering Zambia

If you need to travel outside of Luanda:

* only travel with experienced people who know and understand local conditions well
* keep to main roads to avoid landmines

#### Travel restrictions

Foreigners need official permission and documents to travel to:

* all areas of Cabinda
* Lunda Norte, except Lucapa and Dundo
* Lunda Sul, except Saurimo

If you travel here without permission, authorities may detain you or restrict your movements.

Seek official travel permission and documents from:

* the Angolan partner sponsoring your visit to Angola
* main police stations in Lucapa, Dundo or Saurimo

#### Driver's licence

To drive in Angola, you need:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* registration papers
* insurance papers

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Road accidents are common due to:

* poorly maintained roads
* dangerous driving practices

Street vendors, motor scooters and pedestrians on the roads also pose safety risks.

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in Angola than in Australia.

Fuel shortages can occur. Plan your road travel accordingly.

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Public transport

Public transport is overcrowded, poorly maintained and unsafe.

#### Air travel

Airports in regional centres in Angola have very limited facilities. Most runways are in poor condition. This is worse in the wet season, from October to May.

Flight delays often occur.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Angola's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/) with the Aviation Safety Network.
