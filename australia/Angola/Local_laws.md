# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Australian Government may not be notified if you're detained or arrested. Ask police or prison officials to tell the Australian High Commission in Pretoria, South Africa.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include mandatory jail terms.

#### Other laws

Using cameras, binoculars, GPS devices, or maps near government buildings or infrastructure is illegal.

Don't take photos or film people without their permission, particularly around government buildings or key infrastructure. Your equipment may be confiscated, and you may be the subject of prosecution or police questioning. 

If you do this, local police may detain or question you.

Same-sex relationships were decriminalised in January 2019. However, there are local sensitivities. Avoid public displays of affection.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Angola recognises dual nationality.

If you're an Australian-Angolan dual national, local authorities will consider you an Angolan citizen. This may limit your access to [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/our-services) if you're detained or arrested.

Dual nationals who visit Angola may have to perform compulsory military or civil service.

If you're a dual national, check with your nearest [embassy or consulate of Angola](http://www.smevisa.gov.ao/visatype.aspx) before you travel.
