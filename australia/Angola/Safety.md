#### Crime

#### Violent crime

The crime rate in Angola is high. Crimes are often violent.

Common crimes include:

* pickpocketing
* snatch and grab [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* armed robbery
* carjackings

Attacks can occur at any time. The risk of violent crime is much higher at night.

Armed criminals also target vehicles for smash-and-grab robberies when they are:

* stationary
* in slow-moving traffic

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* take care in crowded places such as markets
* avoid walking in Luanda at night
* avoid walking between bars and restaurants on the Ilha, an island near Luanda
* be alert for attempts to stop your vehicle
* use varied routes and schedules for your travel
* lock your car doors and keep windows up at all times

HIV/AIDS is common. Get urgent medical advice if you're a victim of violent crime, especially [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"). 

Police support may be limited.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") is a risk in and around Luanda. Victims are usually foreigners. They are often abducted from their vehicles by criminals seeking a ransom.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations could take place and become violent. Avoid large gatherings and political rallies. Follow the instructions of local authorities.

Civil unrest, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Hotspots for civil unrest include:

* Cabinda
* Lunda Norte
* Lunda Sul

Militant groups claiming independence are active in Cabinda province. Clashes with security forces can occur.

Armed gangs have attacked foreigners outside Cabinda city. They have warned that attacks will continue, including:

* robbery
* sexual assault
* murder

Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul provinces are diamond-mining areas. There's potential for civil unrest and associated crime. Violence against foreigners in these provinces occurs.

To protect yourself during unrest, avoid protests and large public gatherings.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Attacks could happen anywhere and at any time.

To reduce your risk:

* consider likely terrorist targets and the level of security provided
* always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious items or activities to police
* take official warnings seriously
* monitor the media for threats
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This applies if you're evacuated from a building for security reasons, such as a bomb threat.
