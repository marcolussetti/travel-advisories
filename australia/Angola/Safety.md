#### Crime

#### Violent crime

The crime rate in Angola is high. Crimes are often violent.

Common crimes include:

* pickpocketing
* snatch and grab [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* armed robbery
* carjackings

Attacks can occur at any time. The risk of violent crime is much higher at night.

Armed criminals also target vehicles for smash-and-grab robberies when they are:

* stationary
* in slow-moving traffic

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* take care in crowded places such as markets
* avoid walking in Luanda at night
* avoid walking between bars and restaurants on the Ilha, an island near Luanda
* be alert for attempts to stop your vehicle
* use varied routes and schedules for your travel
* lock your car doors and keep windows up at all times

HIV/AIDS is common. Get urgent medical advice if you're a victim of violent crime, especially [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"). 

Police support may be limited.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There's a threat of kidnapping in Angola. Foreigners have been kidnapped by armed groups for ransom. Kidnappings have occurred in Luanda.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
