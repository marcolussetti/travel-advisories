#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Angola. Take enough legal medicine for your trip. 

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating: 

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Angola are very limited.

Luanda has several clinics run by expatriate organisations.

Other health care is extremely basic. Resources are in short supply, including:

* trained specialists
* safe blood supplies
* medication

Medical treatment is expensive. Clinics normally expect you to pay cash before they'll treat you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need evacuation to South Africa or somewhere else with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
