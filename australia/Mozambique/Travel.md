#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Land border closures

Land border crossings into neighbouring countries may be restricted or blocked at short notice. 

#### Visas

You'll need a visa to enter Mozambique. Please see the [Embassy of the Republic of Mozambique](https://embamoc.jp/visas) for more information on visa types and document requirements.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest Mozambique [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/137) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

To enter Mozambique, you need to hold a tourist visa, working visa, temporary residence visas or identification document and foreign residence (DIRE). You don't need to request authorization to exit Mozambique.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mozambique if you're arriving from a country with yellow fever. If you cannot present your yellow fever certificate you will be detained and returned to your country of departure.

#### Travel via South Africa

If you're travelling through South Africa, you may also need:

* a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate
* documents for parents or guardians [travelling with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children")

South Africa doesn't accept [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/getting-passport-how-it-works/special-travel-documents). Other conditions may apply.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the[Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/137) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is Mozambique Metical (MZN). It's illegal to export or import MZN.

You can get MZN by exchanging:

* US dollars and South African rand in urban centres
* traveller's cheques, in US dollars or euros, at major banks in Maputo

You can only change traveller's cheques for MZN. It's difficult to change traveller's cheques outside of Maputo. You may be charged a high rate of commission.

Several ATMs in Maputo take international credit cards. You can use credit cards in most places. Mastercard is not accepted by all vendors and cannot be used to withdraw cash from ATMs.

Before you travel, ask your bank if your cards will work in Mozambique.

Keep your card in sight at all times during transactions.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

All known minefields have been cleared. However, risks remain.

Take care travelling away from the main road networks in remote and rural areas. Be very careful in the central and southern provinces.

Stick to well-travelled roads.

#### Driving permit

To drive, you must have both:

* a valid Australian driver licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Mozambique than in Australia. It's dangerous to drive at night on rural roads.

Driving hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads
* poor local driving practices
* animals and pedestrians on poorly lit roads, especially in rural areas

If you plan to travel outside Maputo during the rainy season from November to April, you'll need a 4WD vehicle.

During the rainy season, road damage and floods may occur, including in:

* Gaza
* Inhambane
* Sofala
* Zambezia
* Tete
* the North-South road

Some pedestrians may deliberately cause accidents to extort money from you.

If you plan to drive in Mozambique:

* check you have the right insurance
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* ask for local advice on road conditions outside major centres
* keep doors locked and windows closed at all time
* avoid travelling after dark
* ensure you have adequate fuel for your trip

Stop at police signals, including at checkpoints. Checkpoints are common. Only national police have the authority to establish a road checkpoint. Police may conduct a vehicle inspection or request identification documents. Failure to provide identification documents may result in a fine.

Police might ask for a bribe. If police request a bride:

* remain calm and courteous
* show original documentation but do not hand them over
* ask for a clear explanation and request a written fine to be paid at a police station

Unofficial checkpoints have been reported throughout the country.

Check if your insurance policy covers you when using a motorbike or similar other vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport. It can be unreliable and unsafe.

Choose to hire a car and driver from a reputable provider.

#### Sea travel

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") is a threat in the Indian Ocean.

Somali pirates have attacked shipping vessels up to 1000 nautical miles (1852 km) from the Somali coast. Targets include:

* take security precautions
* be alert to threats

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
