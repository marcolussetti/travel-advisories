## Overview

### Safety

* Protests and demonstrations have occurred following the elections in October 2024. These have decreased in frequency and severity since early 2025. Avoid all protests and demonstrations as they can turn violent. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.
* There has been an increase in looting, break-ins, and robberies. There have also been incidents of prisoners breaking out of prisons. Police have used live ammunition, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, resulting in civilians being killed and injured.
* Terrorism is a threat in Mozambique, with a higher threat in Cabo Delgado and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. Attacks are very likely to occur in Cabo Delgado province and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. Terrorists are likely to target foreigners, including westerners and western interests, and in towns and other areas where foreign companies operate and where expatriate staff reside. Clashes between armed groups linked to Islamist extremism and security forces are frequent. Raids on towns and villages, roadside ambushes and other attacks are common. There's an increased presence of security forces in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces.
* Kidnapping is a threat throughout Mozambique, including in Maputo, Sofala and in Cabo Delgado province. If you're travelling to these areas, seek professional security advice.
* Due to lengthy delays experienced at the Lebombo/Komatipoort border, opportunistic criminals have targeted travellers and their vehicles. Take the appropriate precautions.
* Violent attacks, including sexual assaults, occur. The risk of crime increases at night and during holidays. Don't go out after dark, even in tourist areas, and avoid isolated locations. Armed robbery, break-ins and car-jackings are common. Keep your accommodation and car doors locked.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).
* Petty crime, such as bag snatching, is common. Carry only what you need and leave valuables in a secure place.
* Mozambique experiences flooding, cyclones, mudslides and earthquakes. These can disrupt services. The rainy season is November to April.

### Health

* Malaria occurs year-round, particularly outside Maputo. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases include filariasis, plague and African sleeping sickness. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof and use insect repellent.
* The HIV/AIDS risk is high. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases include cholera, hepatitis, tuberculosis and rabies. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities are limited. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

* Don't buy endangered wildlife products, such as ivory and rhino horn. It's illegal to purchase or trade them without a licence.

### Travel

* Protests and strikes have occurred following elections in October 2024. Protests can impact essential services including airports, roads and transportation. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities.
* Land border crossings into neighbouring countries may be restricted or blocked at short notice.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest high commission/embassy or consulate of Mozambique for the latest details. To enter Mozambique, you will need a valid tourist visa, a valid working or temporary residence visa, or an identification document and foreign residence (DIRE).
* Carry your yellow fever vaccination certificate if you're coming from a country where yellow fever is present. You may need it to enter Mozambique.
* If you're visiting Mozambique for 4 weeks or more, you may be required to show on departure proof of polio vaccination, recorded on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). You should receive the polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months before you depart from Mozambique. Failure to produce an ICVP may result in being vaccinated on departure.
* Although all known minefields have been cleared, there's still a risk of landmines. Stick to well-travelled roads, particularly in the central and southern provinces. If you plan to travel outside Maputo during the rainy season, you'll need a 4WD vehicle. Get local advice on road conditions before you leave.
* Piracy is a threat in the Indian Ocean. If you're planning boat travel, check the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy reports](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).
