# Overview

Latest update

Protests and strikes continue across the country following the elections in October 2024. These have resulted in deaths, destruction of property and blockades of roads. Land border crossings into neighbouring countries may be restricted or blocked at short notice. You should keep informed about the situation at and around local airports as access may be blocked by protestors and authorities. Plan sufficient travel time and check your flight status before leaving for the airport. If you need to shelter in place, ensure you have sufficient supplies (cash, water, food, medicines, fuel) as ongoing strikes may lead to supply shortages. Police have used live ammunition, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Avoid all protests and demonstrations, monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.  
  
We continue to advise reconsider your need to travel to Mozambique due to the volatile security situation. If you're already there, you should consider leaving if it's safe to do so.   
  
We also continue to advise do not travel to Cabo Delgado province, Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province due to the extreme threat of terrorism, kidnapping, and ongoing clashes between armed groups and security forces. Terrorists are likely to target areas frequented by foreigners, including where foreign companies operate and where expatriate staff reside. There's a kidnapping risk across Mozambique. Kidnappings have occurred in Maputo, Beira, Sofala and in Cabo Delgado province (see 'Safety').

## Overview

### Safety

* Protests and demonstrations are continuing to take place across the country to occur following the elections in October 2024. Avoid all protests and demonstrations as they can turn violent. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.
* There has been an increase in looting, break-ins, and robberies. There have also been incidents of prisoners breaking out of prisons. Police have used live ammunition, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, resulting in civilians being killed and injured.
* Terrorism is a threat in Mozambique, with a higher threat in Cabo Delgado and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. Attacks are very likely to occur in Cabo Delgado province and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. Terrorists are likely to target foreigners, including westerners and western interests, and in towns and other areas where foreign companies operate and where expatriate staff reside. Clashes between armed groups linked to Islamist extremism and security forces are frequent. Raids on towns and villages, roadside ambushes and other attacks are common. There's an increased presence of security forces in Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces.
* Kidnapping is a threat throughout Mozambique, including in Maputo, Sofala and in Cabo Delgado province. If you're travelling to these areas, get professional security advice.
* Due to lengthy delays experienced at the Lebombo/Komatipoort border, opportunistic criminals have targeted travellers and their vehicles. Take the appropriate precautions.
* Violent attacks, including sexual assaults, occur. The risk of crime increases at night and during holidays. Don't go out after dark, even in tourist areas, and avoid isolated locations. Armed robbery, break-ins and car-jackings are common. Keep your accommodation and car doors locked.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).
* Petty crime, such as bag snatching, is common. Carry only what you need and leave valuables in a secure place.
* Mozambique experiences flooding, cyclones, mudslides and earthquakes. These can disrupt services. The rainy season is November to April.

### Travel

* Nationwide strikes have occurred following the national elections that were held on 9 October 2024. Strikes impact essential services including airports, roads and transportation. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities.
* Options for domestic and international flights have been significantly reduced. You should keep informed about the situation at and around the airport. Plan sufficient travel time and check whether your flight is taking place before leaving for the airport.
* Land border crossings into neighbouring countries may be restricted or blocked at short notice.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest high commission/embassy or consulate of Mozambique for the latest details. To enter Mozambique, you will need a valid tourist visa, a valid working or temporary residence visa, or an identification document and foreign residence (DIRE).
* Carry your yellow fever vaccination certificate if you're coming from a country where yellow fever is present. You may need it to enter Mozambique.
* If you're visiting Mozambique for 4 weeks or more, you may be required to show on departure proof of polio vaccination, recorded on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). You should receive the polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months before you depart from Mozambique. Failure to produce an ICVP may result in being vaccinated on departure.
* Although all known minefields have been cleared, there's still a risk of landmines. Stick to well-travelled roads, particularly in the central and southern provinces. If you plan to travel outside Maputo during the rainy season, you'll need a 4WD vehicle. Get local advice on road conditions before you leave.
