#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you're going to high-risk areas, you'll probably need a specialised insurance policy. Check your insurance policy before you travel to high-risk areas in Mozambique.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs year-round, particularly outside Maputo.

Other common diseases spread by insects include:

* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* check your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you develop a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Mpox

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. Mpox has spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Mozambique.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Get professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mozambique. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are limited.

Costs are generally lower than in Australia. You'll need to pay upfront for treatment, even if you have travel insurance.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
