#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat in Mozambique, with a higher threat in Cabo Delgado and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. Terrorists are likely to target foreigners and foreign interests, including in towns and other areas where foreign companies operate and where expatriate staff reside. 

The insurgency poses an extreme threat in Cabo Delgado and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province, and attacks are highly likely to continue, including in areas not previously affected by terrorist attacks.

An attack could happen anywhere and at any time.

To reduce your risks:

* consider likely terrorist targets and the level of security provided
* always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious items or activities to police
* take official warnings seriously
* monitor the media for threats
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This also applies if you're evacuated from a building for security reasons, such as a bomb threat.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There's a threat of kidnapping in Mozambique. Groups with links to Islamic extremism are present, particularly in Cabo Delgado province.

Foreigners have been kidnapped by armed groups for ransom.

Kidnappings have occurred in Maputo and Beira. Most victims are locals but foreigners, including Australians, may be targeted.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* seek professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Violent clashes between armed groups linked to Islamist extremism and security forces have been occurring in Cabo Delgado province.

Raids on towns and villages, roadside ambushes and other attacks are occurring. There's an increased presence of security forces in the province, and clashes between security forces and insurgents are frequent.

We advise do not travel to Cabo Delgado, and in Erati and Memba districts of Nampula province. If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to these areas, you should:

* get professional security advice
* check that your travel insurer will cover you
* check local and social media for updates before you travel
* take extra precautions and to protect yourself from security and health risks
* follow the advice of local authorities.

Attacks continue to occur in various locations, including the districts of:

* Chuire

* Montepuez
* Mueda
* Mocimboa da Praia
* Muidumbe
* Nangade
* Palma
* Macomia
* Ancuabe
* Meluco
* Ibo and
* Quissanga.

Militants have used machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as destroying vehicles, buildings and infrastructure. It is possible that violence could spill over into other districts. 

Attacks have also occurred on the EN1 road between the Save River and Muxungue and from Gorongosa to Caia, and on the EN6 road between Beira and Chimoio.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests have occurred following elections in October 2024. These have decreased in frequency and severity since early 2025. The unrest resulted in deaths, destruction of property and blockades of roads, including to and from airports.

To reduce your risks of being affected by demonstrations and protests, you should:

* avoid large crowds
* be aware of your surroundings
* maintain a low profile and do not record or photograph gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* carry certified copies of identification keep original documents in a secure location
* consider your personal security
* keep your cell phone charged
* monitor local media for updates and adjust your travel plans accordingly
* have a prepared plan for emergencies, including ensuring you have sufficient supplies of cash, water, food, medicines and fuel, as ongoing strikes may lead to supply shortages.

#### Crime

Violent attacks, including [sexual assaults](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), can occur at any time of day.

Criminal activity increases at night and during holiday periods.

Petty crime is common and includes:

* [mugging and robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* bag snatching

Criminals may target travellers.

Armed robbery and break-ins are common in Maputo and other towns. Gangs of armed robbers have attacked restaurants and cafes after dark.

Carjacking is also common. Be extra careful:

* in Maputo
* on roads to Mutare, Zimbabwe
* on roads to South Africa
* at toll booths

Serious [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and robberies have occurred at 2 coastal resorts in Inhambane province.

To protect yourself from crime:

* secure your windows, doors and gates, including when you're inside your residence
* carry only what you need
* leave valuables, such as your passport, in a secure place
* don't carry bags that are easy to snatch
* avoid going out after dark, even in tourist areas
* stay away from isolated beaches and picnic spots

To avoid being carjacked or assaulted in your car, always keep your windows up and doors locked, even when moving.

If you're a victim of violent crime, including sexual assault, get medical assistance. The risk of HIV/AIDS infection is high.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.
