# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Actions that are offensive or anti-social but not criminal in Australia could be against Saudi law.

If you break Saudi law, even without knowing, the punishment may be severe.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail. Ensure that you read carefully the information on our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") to find out what we can and cannot do.

Local authorities have arrested Australians travelling or living in Saudi Arabia and didn't always report these cases to the [Embassy of Australia in Riyadh.](https://saudiarabia.embassy.gov.au/ryad/contact-us.html)

If you're arrested, approval from local authorities for Embassy staff to visit you may take many months to be obtained.

#### Drugs

Penalties for trafficking, possessing or using drugs are severe. These can include the death penalty.

Police may detain you if you're in the company of someone who is involved in drug cases, including trafficking, possessing or using drugs. You may remain in detention until investigations of all parties are concluded.

#### Local and commercial matters

Get professional advice for local legal matters, including, but not limited to:

Understand your rights and obligations. This includes if you're involved in a commercial or employment/labour dispute with your employer or sponsor. Authorities may not let you leave the country until the dispute is resolved. Commercial or labour dispute cases may take years to finalise.

You also need to understand your rights to make decisions for your children or yourself if you're in Saudi Arabia as a dependent sponsored by a primary visa holder. If you're sponsored and are involved in a custody or domestic violence dispute with the primary visa holder, you may be unable to leave Saudi Arabia for an extended period if the primary visa holder/sponsor refuses to issue an exit visa to allow you to leave the country.

#### Marriage

If you wish to [marry](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") a Saudi national, your partner will first need a letter of approval from the Ministry of the Interior. Check current requirements and timeframes directly with the relevant local authorities.

#### Resident identity card

If you're a resident, you must always carry your resident identity card (Iqama).

If you travel on a visa, you should always carry your passport. Saudi authorities have the right to check ID. There are security checkpoints, both in cities and on roads between cities.

#### Serious offences

Authorities can detain you without charge if you're suspected of committing an offence and keep you detained while they investigate.

You may have to wait months for legal help or for a court appearance while authorities investigate.

Trials are held under Islamic law and procedures.

People convicted of serious offences can face:

* long jail sentences
* heavy fines
* deportation
* lashes

Penalties for some offences are severe and can carry the death penalty. These offences include:

* murder
* serious physical assault
* adultery
* rape
* same-sex relations

* publicly display or wear non-Islamic religious symbols or text
* be involved in charity and fundraising activities, including online or via social media without prior approval from local authorities

* military sites and checkpoints
* diplomatic missions
* palaces
* motorcades

Get permission before taking photographs of people, especially women and children.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Same-sex relationships are illegal. Saudi Arabia doesn't recognise or allow same-sex marriages and rights. Authorities can impose severe punishment.

More information:

* [Advice for LGBTQIA+ travellers](/node/349)

#### Passports with 'X' gender identifier

You will not be able to enter Saudi Arabia if your passport shows 'X' in the gender field.

#### Sexual assault

Sexual assault and harassment are illegal in Saudi Arabia, but may still occur, particularly in large crowds.

If you're [sexually assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/sexual-assault-overseas), you may face criminal prosecution. Authorities may not consider you to be a victim of crime. Sexual assault victims may be jailed after reporting incidents to local police or when seeking medical help.

If you're a victim of sexual assault, find out about support services as quickly as possible from the:

* [Embassy of Australia in Riyadh](https://saudiarabia.embassy.gov.au/)
* Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra

Consular officers can't provide legal or medical advice. However, they can provide lists of English-speaking service providers who may be able to help. See 'Local contacts'.

If you're travelling to Saudi Arabia for a major entertainment event such as the MDLBEAST Music Festival (where reports of sexual harassment are common), you may need to take extra precautions, particularly as a female.

Women face greater risks than men and may be more vulnerable. These risks include:

* unwanted attention
* verbal harassment
* groping (especially at crowded events)
* sexual assault

Consider your clothing and dress. Many countries are more conservative than Australia and have different standards for women and men. Dressing conservatively may help you avoid unwanted attention, including clothing styles that locals may consider different.

Be aware of your surroundings. If you feel uncomfortable, leave.

Be cautious of unsolicited invitations from strangers, especially if they try to separate you from your travelling companions.

Only use licensed taxis or approved ride-share services (such as Uber, Bolt, or Jeeny). Refuse offers from drivers who approach you.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Saudi Government doesn't recognise dual nationality for its citizens. Authorities will seize extra passports if they find them, and charges, including imprisonment, may be laid if you hold a second nationality without permission from the relevant Saudi authorities.

If you're a dual national (e.g Australian/UK nationals), and you're travelling with both passports, you can only leave Saudi Arabia with the passport you used to enter.

If you're a dual citizen and entered the country on a non-Australian passport, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide, including if you're arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

Always respect religious and cultural sensitivities, rules and customs.

The Saudi weekend is Friday and Saturday.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is observed in Saudi Arabia. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

Don't eat, drink or smoke in public between sunrise and sunset during [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan"). Authorities can detain and even deport you for doing so.

Explore our [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### Segregation

Segregation in public places is much less strict than it used to be, particularly in Saudi Arabia's major urban centres. However, it may still occur in some areas of public places such as gyms, restaurants and shops. Segregation may be by gender or family.

#### Accommodation

Individual travellers seeking to share accommodation have sometimes been refused joint occupancy. The situation is changing as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia transforms. You should contact your accommodation provider to seek clarification on the requirements. It is important to respect local customs and act in a culturally appropriate manner.

Further information can be found on the [Visit Saudi Official Website](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-support).

#### Behaviour

Saudi Arabia has strict codes of behaviour. You can be fined for violating Saudi Arabia's Public Taste Regulations. Read more on [Public decorum](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/home/publicdecorum).

Locals may be offended if you don't respect these codes. They may interpret this as religious or cultural disrespect.

#### Dress

Get advice on what is acceptable clothing before you arrive.

Both men and women are asked to dress modestly in public. Avoid tight fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images.

Men and women visiting Saudi Arabia should cover their shoulders and knees in public. If you don’t comply with these requirements, you may face penalties. If approached by authorities, be respectful and remain calm.
