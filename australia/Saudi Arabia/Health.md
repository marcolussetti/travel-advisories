#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave. Travellers to Saudi Arabia (excluding residents) must have medical insurance that includes coverage for the cost of COVID-19 treatment. If you're entering on a tourist visa (eVisa), coverage for COVID-19 treatment is included in the visa cost. You can review the policy of medical insurance to confirm what is and isn't covered via the [Council of Health Insurance](https://eservices.chi.gov.sa/Pages/ClientSystem/CheckVisitorsInsurance.aspx?lang=en) website. For further details, see the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-support) website. 

Your policy also needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

You should confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Resident identity card holders

If you hold a resident identity card (Iqama), your employer must provide medical insurance. Review the policy carefully to confirm what is and isn't covered.

Medical insurance will not cover pregnancy or maternity unless you're married and it's in your insurance policy.

If you're admitted to one of the intensive care units, you won't be allowed to move to another hospital without prior approval by both hospitals as well as your travel insurance provider.

#### Tourists

Saudi tourist visas include some medical insurance. Check the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-support) website and the insurance policy [website](https://chi.gov.sa/en/Rules/Pages/VisitorsInsurance.aspx)for further information.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check [if it's legal in Saudi Arabia](https://www.sfda.gov.sa/en/drugs-list). Take enough legal medicine for your trip. Carry your medicine in its original packaging and a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor that states:

* your name
* the medicine's brand and scientific (chemical) name
* the prescribed dosage and the duration of treatment, and
* that it's for your personal use.

Saudi authorities may detain or deport travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis - see [Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/united-arab-emirates#health)

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Most facilities in major cities offer high to very high-quality services.

Facilities in minor towns and small cities can only do routine procedures.

If you're treated at a private facility, you may need to pay before doctors will treat you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Facilities for travellers with a disability are different to Australia.
