## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable. If the regional security situation deteriorates again this may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions at short notice. There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region, as well as the potential for terrorist attacks.
* Australians should read our general advice about [terrorism risks](/node/342) and  protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](/node/622).
* Ongoing hostilities pose serious security risks across the region. There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Demonstrations and protests are illegal in Saudi Arabia, and there may be severe penalties for participation. Avoid all demonstrations and protests should they occur.
* Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Avoid possible targets such as energy infrastructure. Be alert at places frequented by foreigners and at large-scale entertainment events. Take official warnings seriously.
* Crime rates are low, but theft can happen, especially in crowded places and from vehicles. Physical, verbal and sexual harassment can also occur.
* Be prepared for extreme weather. From June to August, temperatures can exceed 50°C. Sandstorms and dust storms are common.
* Driving can be hazardous. The annual road death toll is extremely high.

### Health

* Travellers to Saudi Arabia (excluding residents) must have medical insurance that covers the cost of COVID-19 treatment. This is included in the cost of a tourist visa (eVisa). See further details on the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-support) website.
* There are new vaccination requirements for visitors travelling to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah or visit Holy Mosques. For more information, see the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx) website.
* Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have been reported. Avoid contact with camels or products contaminated with camel secretions.
* Sandstorms and dust storms can cause allergies and breathing problems. Discuss your travel plans with a doctor if you have an existing condition.
* Malaria, including chloroquine-resistant strains, is present in south-western Saudi Arabia. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue and leishmaniasis. Use insect repellent.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for trafficking, possessing or using drugs are severe. These can include the death penalty.
* Many laws in Saudi Arabia are different to those in Australia, including for same-sex relations and abandoning the Islamic religion. Punishment may include imprisonment and the death penalty. Get professional advice for local legal matters. You may be prevented from leaving the country until issues are resolved.
* It’s illegal to mock, provoke or question public order, religious values or public morals. Criticising Saudi Arabia, the royal family, the leadership or Islam is also against the law. These laws extend to social media posts, even if posted many years ago and outside Saudi Arabia. Foreigners have been sentenced to decades in prison for offensive tweets made outside Saudi Arabia years before their visit to the country.
* Alcohol is prohibited in Saudi Arabia.
* It's against the law to have sexual relations or live together outside of marriage. If you're sexually assaulted, you may face criminal prosecution. Authorities may not consider you to be a victim of crime.
* In Saudi Arabia, men and women should dress modestly in public. Cover your shoulders and knees and avoid tight-fitting clothes or clothes with profane language or images.
* Same-sex relationships are illegal. Saudi Arabia does not recognise or allow same-sex marriages and rights.

### Travel

* All Saudi visa holders of Muslim faith are permitted to perform Umrah at any time throughout the year, except around Hajj time, when only Hajj visa/permit holders can enter Makkah. Monitor the media for information about the dates the Hajj time starts.
* Saudi Hajj and Umrah Ministry have launched the ‘[Nusuk’](https://www.nusuk.sa/) platform to register and facilitate pilgrim procedures for both Umrah and Hajj.
* Australian citizens holding valid Australian passports can apply for a tourist visa online or on arrival. Check the [Saudi eVisa](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/?_ga=2.38204960.203637712.1643716791-1500723252.1635340540) website for current information on tourist visas. A visa does not guarantee your entry to Saudi Arabia. Check visa conditions before your arrival.
* Unless you’re a resident of Saudi Arabia, you must have medical insurance that covers the cost of COVID-19 treatment (see ‘Health’). See further details on the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-support) website.
