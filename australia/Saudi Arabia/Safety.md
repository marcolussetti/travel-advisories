#### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism in Saudi Arabia. An attack could happen anywhere, at any time.

Several terror incidents have happened in Saudi Arabia in recent years, including those targeted at Saudi security forces. 

On occasion, attacks have targeted the minority Shia community in Saudi Arabia’s eastern province.

Foreigners have died or been injured in attacks that were targeted at others.

Further attacks are possible.

Possible terrorism targets include:

* shopping malls
* restaurants
* recreational facilities
* entertainment events
* embassies and consulates
* other symbols of Western culture

Attacks may be planned or random, large or small. Tactics could include bombings, drive-by shootings or [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping").

If you're in Saudi Arabia:

* be alert to possible threats and avoid possible targets for a terror attack
* always have a clear exit plan in case there's a security incident
* monitor the media for new or emerging threats
* report any suspicious activity or items to police
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The political situation within Saudi Arabia is currently stable. However, the security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

Military tensions remain in neighbouring Yemen. Missiles, explosive-laden drones and explosive-laden boats have targeted civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, including ports and airports. Most attacks have been intercepted by the Saudi military.

Most of these attacks occur close to the Yemen border, especially in the provinces of Jazan, Najran and Aseer (including Abha). Urban centres in the Eastern Province have been targeted, in addition to oil infrastructure in that province. The capital Riyadh, and cities on the Red Sea, such as Jeddah and Yanbu, have also been targeted in the past. Other areas may be targeted from time to time.

Targets have included:

* urban areas
* oil infrastructure
* military
* government facilities
* ports
* public facilities, such as airports

Such attacks may continue. The frequency of attacks vary and not all individual attacks are always widely publicised.

To stay safe in the event of an attack:

* if you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover
* stay away from windows or openings.
* seek shelter in the centre of the building at the lowest level possible
* be aware that if an incoming missile or drone is intercepted, falling debris can pose a risk
* after an attack, stay away from any debris
* follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media for emerging threats

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations are illegal, and any large spontaneous gatherings are unusual. You should avoid any demonstration or protest activity if it occurs. Penalties for participating in demonstrations or protests may be severe.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Crime

Overall the rate of crime in Saudi Arabia is low.

Theft can occur, including in crowded places, malls and from vehicles.

Carry only what you need. Leave other valuables in a secure place.

Keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving.

Take care when travelling outside towns and cities, and in crowded areas.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Piracy

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") occurs in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Pirates target all forms of shipping, including:

* commercial vessels
* pleasure craft
* luxury cruise liners
* naval vessels

The [International Maritime Bureau](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) issues piracy reports.

If you travel by boat to or near Saudi Arabia despite the risks:

* monitor piracy reports for the region
* exercise extreme caution
* be alert to possible threats
* avoid confrontation

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Make sure any unused SIM cards are kept in a safe place or deactivated by contacting your service provider, to prevent misuse by others. Do not share any verification code received on your mobile with others. Verify any text message claiming to be from the bank by communicating directly with the bank.

Australian travellers have been victims of scams overseas where bank accounts have been subjected to online fraud, including through online purchases from foreign countries. Be aware of scams related to renting properties within Saudi Arabia.

Foreign residents in Saudi Arabia have also been the targets of an identity theft scam. Individuals impersonate a call from the Ministry of Interior to discuss a problem with your Absher account and request one-time passwords (OTPs) or identifying information that gives access to your Absher account. It is unlikely that the Ministry of Interior will contact you this way. Treat any calls of this nature as a scam.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media, even for comments published many years earlier. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Punishment for social media activities (including commenting, posting, re-posting and liking content considered illegal or against the royal family) can result in lengthy prison sentences.

#### Climate and natural disasters

It's very hot in Saudi Arabia. June to August are the hottest months of the year, and the temperature can be over 50°C. Consume adequate liquids and avoid extended periods in direct sunlight during summer.

Sandstorms and dust storms are common.

If a [natural disaster](/node/346) or [severe weather](/node/347) occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor the media and local sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family
