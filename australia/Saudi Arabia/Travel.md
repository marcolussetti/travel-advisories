#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Hajj season 2025

For the Hajj season 2025, local authorities have announced additional arrangements, procedures and entry/exit restrictions which must be followed by all foreign citizens who are coming to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

This includes not entering or staying in Makkah (Mecca) between 29 April 2025 until 11 June 2025 without either a valid work permit in Makkah, a residency ID issued from Makkah or a valid Hajj permit. For more information on visas got to the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-center) website. For the latest information on Hajj arrangements, see [the Ministry of Interior X account](https://x.com/MOISaudiArabia/status/1911130993756430466).

Local authorities also announced that the deadline for Umrah pilgrims’ departure from Saudi Arabia is 29 April 2025. Umrah Pilgrims who have remained in the country beyond this date will be subject to legal penalties. For more information see the [Ministry of Hajj and Umrah X account.](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FMoHU_En%2Fstatus%2F1909600304804278716%3Ft%3Dn5TjwU5dUYTmRG9-wFMUoA%26s%3D08&data=05%7C02%7CLara.Abu.Dari%40dfat.gov.au%7C9d69c6daed864566571008dd7c0858a9%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638803097475921138%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=o6j6SjoRZQKflyixQXftYmL%2F8%2F0w%2B0mQznXSsdgFHBY%3D&reserved=0)

A Hajj permit is required to perform Hajj. The Kingdom has stated that violators will face fines, imprisonment, and deportation. You may also be banned from going to Saudi Arabia in the future if you do not comply with the rules. 

#### Travelling from Sudan to Saudi Arabia

See the [travel advice for Sudan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/sudan) for information about flying from Sudan to Saudi Arabia.

#### Entry visa

You need a valid visa to enter Saudi Arabia. You can apply for an e-visa at the [Visit Saudi](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/) website.

Australian citizens holding valid Australian passports can apply for tourist visas online or upon arrival. Requirements and policies can change at short notice. Visit the [Saudi eVisa](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/?_ga=2.38204960.203637712.1643716791-1500723252.1635340540) website for current information on tourist visas. A visa does not guarantee your entry to Saudi Arabia. Check visa conditions prior to your arrival.

If you've had a travel ban placed against you in the past to prevent you from re-entering Saudi Arabia, you should check the duration of the ban prior to your arrival, or you may be denied entry to Saudi Arabia.

If you have a previous unresolved legal case in Saudi Arabia, you may be arrested when you arrive. This is regardless of the passport you use to re-enter Saudi Arabia (whether you use an Australian or other passport).

Tourist visas are valid for 12 months and allow for multiple entries starting from the date of issuance. The total period of stay must not exceed (90) days throughout the total 12 months of the visa validity. The visa cannot be extended and cannot be used to gain employment, paid or voluntary, in the country.

Ensure that you read and understand the conditions of your visa. A daily fine will be imposed if you overstay your visa or exceed the maximum stay conditions. You won't be permitted to leave the country until the fine is paid in full. In line with the [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter), the Australian Embassy cannot waive or reduce fines, or request the local authorities to do so.

If you overstay your visa, you may face:

* a significant fine
* detention while waiting to be deported
* a ban from re-entering Saudi Arabia

Tourists under the age of 18 may not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia unless accompanied by a guardian.

Australians visiting Saudi Arabia for purposes other than tourism must obtain a separate and special visa from visa agencies accredited to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia. Contact your nearest [Saudi Embassy or Consulate](https://www.mofa.gov.sa/en/embassies/Pages/default.aspx) for more information.

The [Nusuk](https://hajj.nusuk.sa/) platform has been launched to register and facilitate visas and travel arrangements for Hajj and Umrah. This is the only platform the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has approved to provide Hajj visas and services.

If you’re transiting through Saudi Arabia, you may need a transit visa. Check and confirm with your airline, travel agency and your nearest Saudi Embassy/Consulate if you need a transit visa. Information about how to apply for a transit visa and its conditions is available on the [Visit Saudi](https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/help-center) website.

Only Muslims are allowed to enter Makkah (Mecca) and Madinah.

You may not be allowed to enter through a land crossing, for example the King Fahd Causeway from Bahrain, on a business/visit visa that is annotated “via air’’. Note that this may be written in Arabic. Carefully read and understand the restrictions of your Saudi business/visit visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Saudi Arabia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/174) for details about visas, currency, customs, vaccination and quarantine rules.

Around Hajj time, Saudi authorities restrict entry to and exit from some airports including Jeddah, Madinah, Yanbu, and Taif to Hajj visas holders only. Other travellers may need to justify their need to travel to any of these cities/airport before they can be allowed to board the flight. You can still enter Saudi Arabia through other entry points. Check with your airline, travel agency and your nearest Saudi Embassy/Consulate for up-to-date information.

#### Exit visas

Visitors on a single or multiple-entry business, work or tourist visa don't need an exit permit to leave Saudi Arabia.

If you hold a resident identity card (Iqama), you'll need to get an exit/re-entry or final exit permit from the Saudi Ministry of Interior. You must do this through your sponsor.

You may not be eligible for an exit re-entry visa to leave Saudi Arabia if your passport has less than six months validity.

If you're the main visa holder, make sure that all your dependents have valid passports as you may not be allowed to obtain an exit re-entry visa.

If you're a dual national (e.g Australian/UK nationals), and you're travelling with both passports, you can only leave Saudi Arabia with the passport you used to enter.

See [Local laws](#local-laws)

#### Work visa

It's illegal to work for anyone other than the sponsor or employer officially registered as your employer/sponsor on your residence permit in the Saudi Passports Office’s system.

If you do, you may be punished with:

* fines
* detention
* deportation
* a ban from entering Saudi Arabia

Holders of any type of visa other than a work visa or a resident identity card (Iqama) are not allowed to work in Saudi Arabia.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Saudi Arabia if you're travelling from an area with a risk of yellow fever.

**More information:**

* [Countries with a risk of yellow fever (PDF)](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/travel-and-health/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission.pdf?sfvrsn=bf42ac59_1&download=true)

#### Polio outbreaks

Travellers under the age of 15 arriving from countries with polio outbreaks must provide proof of up-to-date polio vaccination.

**More information:**

* [Embassy or consulate of Saudi Arabia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/174)

#### Travel bans

Authorities may place Australians under a travel ban. This means that you won't be able to leave the country if you're a tourist, visitor or resident identity card (Iqama) holder and you're involved in a dispute about but not limited to:

* business
* labour
* employment
* fines

Authorities are strict with travel bans. They can take months or even years to resolve.

Only Saudi Arabian authorities, and in very limited cases your sponsor, can remove travel bans. Saudi sponsors may have considerable power in dispute negotiations.

Private Saudi citizens may also initiate travel bans against expats.

The government may issue travel bans on people who:

* are charged with criminal offences
* are under investigation
* are involved in financial or labour disputes
* have unpaid debts or who have passed bad cheques

#### Travel restrictions on dependents

Dependents up to the age of 21 of a Saudi Arabian parent need permission to leave Saudi Arabia. More information about whose permission is required is available on the [Absher platform](https://www.absher.sa/wps/portal/individuals/static/footer/about/!ut/p/z1/jZBND4IwDIZ_DVdahozFm0FFRBM88OEuBg0OEmBmoPx9jXox0UlvbZ6nb1rgkAFv81sl8r6SbV4_-j2nB0o2nrViJMSEznG3IBFzlhbB0Ib0CThe5AVsa1t-FLtIlu5k7dHQT9AFPsbHHzXDcb4G4Pr1KXBtREDfgO7EfyFr4KKWx9c_Z-3RZgK4Ks6FKpR5VY9x2feXbmqggcMwmEJKURfmSTYGflNK2fWQfZJwaeI4wypqUtbdARMirKg!/dz/d5/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBLzROV3FpQSEhL2Vu/).

Saudi authorities have introduced fees for dependants that apply to iqama holders.

If you're an expat with outstanding fees for dependants, you may have to pay the fees before you can:

* apply for an exit or re-entry visa
* renew your Iqama
* leave for the final time

#### Hajj

If you're a non-resident, authorities may restrict your entry via air or land to Jeddah, Madinah, Yanbu and Taif during Hajj time. The restrictions may start from one month prior to the Hajj time.

There are new vaccination requirements for visitors travelling to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah or visit Holy Mosques.

**More information:**

* [Hajj](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/hajj)
* [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Pilgrims_Health/Pages/default.aspx)

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Other passport conditions

If you're travelling on an emergency passport, Saudi authorities will not allow you to enter the country. You must have a full validity passport to enter. You can exit the country on an emergency passport but may be required to provide a police report and/or letter from the Embassy to explain why your passport is different to the passport on which you entered the country.

If you have been issued an emergency passport while in Saudi Arabia to replace your lost/stolen passport, you may be required to provide a police report upon your departure.

If you obtain a new passport, including an emergency passport, while in Saudi Arabia to replace your old, lost or stolen passport, you must register the new passport number with the Saudi passport office. Ensure this process is completed prior to your departure, as this service may not be available at airports. Check with your employer/sponsor or the Ministry of Tourism (depending on your visa type) for information on where to complete this process.

If you're travelling on an Australian passport showing ‘X’ in the 'sex' field, authorities will not allow you to enter Saudi Arabia. 'X' refers to those who are indeterminate, intersex or unspecified sex.

Australian travel-related documents issued to non-Australian citizens will not be accepted to enter Saudi Arabia with an electronic visa (even if you obtained the visa online prior to your arrival). You'll need to contact your nearest Saudi Embassy/Consulate for up-to-date advice and information on the acceptance of your travel document and to seek options and confirmation on the appropriate visa that will be accepted to enter the country. If your entry into Saudi Arabia is denied despite holding a valid Saudi visa, the Embassy won’t be able to assist to facilitate your entry.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If you lose your passport before arriving in Saudi Arabia:

* you may not be able to enter the country
* the Embassy of Australia may not be able to provide you with a new passport, as personal lodgement is compulsory to obtain a new passport
* you may have to return to Australia

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Money

The local currency is the Saudi Arabian Riyal (SAR).

When you enter or leave Saudi Arabia, declare amounts of more than SAR60,000 or equivalent per family or group. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Also declare any precious metals worth more than SAR60,000 per family or group.

You can change Australian dollars at commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

ATMs are widely available. Ask your bank if your cards will work in Saudi Arabia.

**More information:**

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

If you have a residency permit (iqama), you'll need to get a Saudi driver’s licence.

To drive in Saudi Arabia, you'll need:

* a valid Australian driver's licence, and
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before departing Australia.

Visitors to Saudi Arabia can only drive hire cars and not privately owned vehicles. You may only be allowed to use your Australian driving licence and IDP for up to 3 months from arrival in the country. Check with the local Traffic Police and your rental company for up-to-date information.

You must carry your driver's licence and vehicle registration when driving. If you're involved in an accident, notify the traffic police (NAJM) and ask for their instructions.

#### Road travel

The annual death toll on Saudi roads is extremely high. Exercise extreme caution when driving in Saudi Arabia and always wear a seat belt.

Safety hazards include:

* drivers ignoring road rules and driving while distracted
* bad weather limiting visibility
* poor road conditions in some parts of the country
* camels straying onto roads

There are checkpoints where you may be required to present identification.

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance covers you
* learn local traffic rules and behaviour
* know what to do in case of an incident or accident
* always keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving

Some Saudi cities have an automated traffic ticketing system. If you're fined, you must pay the fine through this system before leaving the country.

#### Public transport

Saudi Arabia has inter-city bus and limited rail services throughout the country.

Travellers often use limousine services for long-distance travel.

#### Boat travel

Many waters near Saudi Arabia are sensitive because of territorial disputes and security issues.

Due to the military conflict in Yemen, military vessels are stationed in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.

There are ongoing disputes about who has jurisdiction over the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf.

People have reported vessels being inspected and crews detained.

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) can occur in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/saudi-arabia#safety)
