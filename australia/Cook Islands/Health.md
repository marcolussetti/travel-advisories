#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away
* any exclusions to your policy

Ensure you have appropriate insurance cover if you plan to undertake higher-risk activities like diving, off-roading, hiking or other adventure-based activities.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest [Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some medications, such as strong pain medicines or those used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are illegal in the Cook Islands. 

Visitors may bring medicinal cannabis into the Cook Islands from New Zealand and Australia if they meet certain requirements. Visit the [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.ck/) website for more information before you plan your travel.

If you plan to bring over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication, make sure you bring enough for the duration of your trip and carry it in its original packaging. Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use
* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

The [Cook Islands Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.ck/) continues to monitor for dengue and other insect-borne outbreaks.

Cases of disease spread by mosquitoes include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

If you're pregnant, discuss travel plans and health risks with your doctor before you travel.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are found in the Cook Islands.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are limited, especially on outer islands.

Treatment can be expensive. Hospitals and medical facilities may ask for payment before treating you.

You may need to be evacuated to New Zealand or Australia if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Cook Islanders who hold an Australian Passport but don't hold a New Zealand passport, don't qualify for urgent patient referrals (medical evacuations) to New Zealand. Ensure your travel insurance provides appropriate cover for your situation.

No hyperbaric or decompression chambers are available. If you need to be treated for decompression sickness, you'll be evacuated to the nearest treatment centre in either Tahiti or New Zealand.

Registered dive companies carry basic treatment equipment to meet Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) standards.
