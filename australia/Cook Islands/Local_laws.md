# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for carrying or using even small amounts of illegal drugs are severe. They may include fines and prison sentences.

#### Imitation Tobacco Products (vapes/e-cigarettes)

The Cook Islands has banned the sale or importation of imitation tobacco products, including vapes/e-cigarettes. Visitors over the age of 21 are allowed to bring one e-imitation tobacco device and up to 30 millilitres of e-liquid. Visitors must make sure the device and any remaining liquid is taken with them when they depart from The Cook Islands or is surrendered to the Ministry of Health. Refer to the [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.ck/) for more information.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are modest.

Be careful not to offend, especially outside resort areas, when visiting towns, villages and the outer islands.

Visitors are welcome to attend Sunday services, observing modest dress standards. 

Ask for local advice if you're unsure of any customs.
