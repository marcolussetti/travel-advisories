#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Authorities will issue a 31-day visitor visa on arrival. On application you may visit up to 8 months in total. Contact the Cook Islands [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration](https://mfai.gov.ck/form/contact) for the latest details and fees.

To enter the Cook Islands, you'll need to show proof of:

* an onward or return ticket
* sufficient funds for your stay
* arranged accommodation

In other situations, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

#### Travelling with a Criminal Conviction

If you have a criminal conviction, contact the Cook Islands [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration](https://mfai.gov.ck/form/contact) ahead of your intended travel. Immigration Cook Islands will review cases with external agencies. Failure to declare could impact travel in the future.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
