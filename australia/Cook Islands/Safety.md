# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

The crime rate is low in the Cook Islands. Most crime is opportunistic, however, sometimes thieves target travellers. Watch your belongings.

Thieves may target items:

* on the beach
* left unsecured, such as valuables stored in motor scooters or motorcycles

Occasionally, travellers are [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"). Look out for suspicious behaviour.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes:

* tours and travel between islands
* adventure activities, such as scuba diving

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Swimming safety

Some swimmers have died because of strong tides and breaks in the reefs.

Ask local residents and tour operators about safe swimming and water sports areas.

There are no lifeguards on beaches.

#### Wildlife safety

Be aware of local wildlife.

Dogs are common in Rarotonga. Some are aggressive, travel in packs and have bitten people. If you're bitten or scratched, seek medical help immediately.

Be mindful of dogs when walking, cycling or running. Don't approach, touch or feed them.

Be aware when driving, wandering animals are common on the roads.
