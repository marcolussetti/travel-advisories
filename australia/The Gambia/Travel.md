#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

**Visas**

You may need a visa to enter The Gambia.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

Contact the [High Commission of The Gambia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/197) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

**Border measures**

Commercial flights to and from The Gambia may be limited from time to time, especially outside of peak tourist season. The land border with Senegal is open. Contact the [High Commission of The Gambia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/197) for the latest details.

A compulsory Security Airport Fee must be paid upon entering and exiting The Gambia by air. The fee is US$20, or equivalent in euros, pound sterling or local currency. The fee can be paid via marked kiosks in Banjul International Airport. Children below 2 years of age and transit passengers are exempt.

If you're driving across the border into The Gambia in a private vehicle, you may be asked to pay a vehicle registration fee.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter The Gambia. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to travel to other countries after visiting The Gambia.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost and stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Gambian Dalasi (GMD).

Good options for currency exchange include:

* Banjul
* the Atlantic coast resorts
* the tourist area of Senegambia

The Gambia is a cash-based economy.

Credit cards aren't accepted by many hotels, restaurants or retail outlets. Major hotels generally accept them, but sometimes telecommunication issues can make payments difficult.

There are a limited range of ATMs that accept foreign cards. Contact your bank to check if your cards will work in The Gambia.

Make sure you have enough cash to meet your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in The Gambia, you'll need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving is very dangerous in The Gambia.

Driving hazards include:

* poor quality roads
* unsafe driving
* poorly maintained vehicles
* poor street lighting
* people on roads

It's more dangerous at night and outside urban areas.

The rainy season is from June to October. Heavy rain can cause:

* floods
* landslides
* damage to roads

Outside urban areas, four-wheel drives are necessary during the rainy season as roads may be in poor condition.

Police roadblocks are common. Police may ask for your ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers.

If you travel by road:

* learn local traffic laws and practices
* carry photo ID and vehicle registration and ownership papers
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines. It's best to arrange them through your hotel.

#### Public transport

[Public transport](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport") is limited and mainly consists of yellow taxis.

Safety and maintenance standards are unreliable.

#### Boat travel

Travel on river boats including ferries and pirogues (canoes) may be dangerous. They can be overloaded and lack lifesaving equipment.

To reduce your risks:

* avoid boat travel at night
* check operator credentials and safety equipment before booking
* never board an overloaded boat
* insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use safety equipment, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't provided, use another operator or a different form of transport.
