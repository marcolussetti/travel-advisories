#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") for the whole time you'll be away.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever) is widespread in The Gambia. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is also common (World Health Organisation).

Other mosquito-borne diseases also occur, including [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection). To protect yourself:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Polio

While The Gambia was declared free of Wild Poliovirus (Type 1) in 2004, Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (Type 2) has been detected in the country in the last 12 months through environmental surveillance.

### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in The Gambia are limited.

Most doctors and hospitals will ask for up-front cash payment for medical care.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries.

Some prescription or over-the-counter drugs are illegal in The Gambia. This includes skin-bleaching creams and other medication available in Australia.

It's illegal to import, use or possess medication containing:

* codeine
* diazepam
* hydroquinone
* hydrocortisone
* betamethasone
* flucinonide
* clobestatol
* clobestatone

Other restrictions may apply. Check with the [High Commission of The Gambia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/197) before you travel.

Pharmacy regulation in The Gambia is limited, and counterfeit medications are a risk. Bring all essential, legal medication with you.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in The Gambia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use
