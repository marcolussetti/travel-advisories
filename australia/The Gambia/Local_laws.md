# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Gambia often blocks consular access to foreigners in detention.

If you're arrested, ask police or prison officials to contact the Australian High Commission in Abuja, or the Canadian Embassy in Dakar. Do this as soon as possible. See [Local contacts](#local-contacts)

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. The Gambian authorities will take strong action against anyone importing, exporting or found in possession of drugs. Don't accept packages on behalf of anyone without knowing their contents. They can include lengthy jail terms. Westerners have been jailed for up to 10 years for carrying small amounts of cannabis.

#### Dual citizenship

The Gambia recognises dual nationality.

However, if you're a dual national travelling on your other passport and you're arrested, Australian consular officials may not be able to help you.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

#### Information on dress

The Gambia is a mostly Islamic country. Standards of dress and behaviour, especially in interior areas of the country, are conservative. Wear loose clothes that cover your shoulders and knees. Take care not to offend.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in The Gambia. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
