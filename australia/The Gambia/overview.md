## Overview

### Safety

* Avoid large public gatherings as they may turn violent. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Theft from hotel rooms and vehicles happens. Pickpocketing occurs in crowded market areas, on ferries and on tourist beaches. Muggings sometimes occur on beaches at night. Avoid being alone outside at night, especially on beaches. Lock your hotel room, even when you're inside.
* Credit card fraud is a risk. Always keep your card in sight when shopping. Check your statements often.
* Young men known as 'bumsters' may approach tourists, particularly on beaches. They often use romance to get money or other help from you. Politely decline their offers, advances or attempts at conversation. Take care not to offend.
* Online friendship, romance or business scams often start in West Africa, including The Gambia. People who visit The Gambia to meet someone they've met online are at risk of kidnapping, assault or robbery. Be wary of contact with people you don't know. Don't send money to anyone in The Gambia until you've confirmed their identity.
* The rainy season is from June to October. Floods may block roads. Follow the advice of local officials.

### Health

* Yellow fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel. You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter The Gambia. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.
* Malaria is common. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* The HIV/AIDS infection rate is high. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include typhoid, hepatitis, leptospirosis and bilharzia (schistosomiasis). Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water.
* Medical facilities in The Gambia are limited. You'll probably have to pay cash up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this. This can be expensive and hard to organise.

### Local laws

* The Gambia is predominantly an Islamic country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. Ensure your actions don't offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan.
* Gambian authorities have blocked consular access to foreigners in detention in the past. If you're arrested, ask to contact the Australian High Commission in Abuja, or the Canadian Embassy in Dakar. Do this as soon as possible.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties include long jail terms. Westerners have been jailed for up to 10 years for carrying small amounts of cannabis.
* The Gambia has the death penalty for serious crimes, including arson, murder and treason. Corporal punishment applies for some crimes, such as assault, sexual assault, theft and serious driving offences.
* Some prescription and over-the-counter drugs available in Australia are illegal in The Gambia. It's illegal to import, use or carry medications containing certain ingredients, including codeine, diazepam and some corticosteroids. Penalties can include jail terms and heavy fines. Check your medication is legal with a [high commission or consulate of The Gambia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/197) before you travel.
* Same-sex relations are illegal. Penalties include jail sentences ranging from 5 years to life imprisonment.

### Travel

* To enter The Gambia, you need a yellow fever vaccination certificate. You may need a visa to enter The Gambia. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest high commission or consulate of The Gambia for the latest details.
* A compulsory Airport Security Fee must be paid upon entering and exiting The Gambia. The fee is US$20, or equivalent in euros, pound sterling or local currency. You can pay the fee via marked kiosks in Banjul International Airport. Children below 2 years of age and transit passengers are exempt.
* The land border with Senegal is open, but travellers should be careful. Travel on main roads and do not travel after dark in areas near the southern border with Senegal, as armed bandits and separatist groups have operated in the Casamance region in the past and landmines may remain from the conflict. See our travel advice for [Senegal](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/senegal) for more information.
* You can drive in The Gambia with an Australian driver's licence and an International Driving Permit (IDP). Get your IDP before you travel. Police roadblocks are reasonably common. Always carry photo ID, and vehicle registration and ownership papers. Drivers should use main roads where possible and approach official checkpoints with care.
* Outside urban areas, four-wheel drives are necessary during the rainy season as roads may be in poor condition.
* Yellow taxis are the main form of public transport. Safety and maintenance standards are unreliable. Travelling on river boats, including ferries and canoes, may be dangerous. Avoid boat travel at night.

### Local contacts

* The [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") details what we can and can't do to help you overseas.
* Australia doesn't have a high commission or consulate in The Gambia. The [Canadian Embassy in Dakar, Senegal](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/senegal/dakar.aspx?lang=eng), gives consular assistance to Australians in The Gambia. This includes issuing Australian provisional travel documents.
* The [Australian High Commission in Nigeria](http://www.nigeria.highcommission.gov.au/) or the [British High Commission](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-banjul) in The Gambia can provide limited consular help.
* To stay up to date with local information, follow the High Commission’s social media accounts.
