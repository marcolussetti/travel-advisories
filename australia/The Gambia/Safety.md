#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Political protests in The Gambia, have become more frequent in recent years.

Protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To reduce your risk during periods of unrest:

* avoid public gatherings, protests, rallies and demonstrations
* monitor the media and other sources for possible unrest
* follow the advice from local authorities

#### Travel to and from southern Senegal

Overland travel to the southern Casamance region of Senegal can be dangerous. Travellers should use main roads and avoid travelling at night. 

Armed bandits and separatist groups have operated in the Casamance region in the past, with occasional skirmishes crossing the border. Undeclared landmines are present within the Casamance region, particularly in more remote areas off main roads. See our travel advice for [Senegal](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/senegal) for more information.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Theft can occur anywhere, including at your hotel room or vehicle.

Pickpockets operate:

* in crowded market areas
* on ferries
* along tourist beaches

Tourists have been [mugged](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") at night while walking alone on beaches.

To protect yourself from crime:

* avoid being outside alone at night, especially on beaches
* keep car windows up and doors locked
* lock your accommodation, even when you're inside
* keep your credit card in sight when you're using it
* avoid conspicuous displays of money, devices, jewellery and watches
* arrange airport transfers and hotel pick-ups through trusted contacts and hotel services.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

Scams and fraud can be common in The Gambia. 

Be aware of young men known as 'bumsters'. They approach tourists, particularly on beaches.

They might offer to:

* help as a local guide
* sell you things
* simply have a conversation to become your friend

Bumsters often also use romance schemes to try to get money or other forms of help from you. They may also try to leave the country through marriage to a foreigner.

Politely decline offers, advances or attempts at conversation from bumsters. Take care not to offend.

#### Internet scams

Internet [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") come in many forms, including romance, friendship, business and job offers. These scams often originate in West African countries. The scammer may pose as someone they are not, or they may display a completely false identity.

In other cases, foreigners are lured to Africa to meet their prospective friend or marriage partner. Once in Africa, they may become victims of kidnapping, assault, robbery or extortion.

There have also been cases of sextortion, where scammers develop a fake romantic relationship and then ask to exchange revealing photographs or videos. Once they have these, the nature of the relationship will often change abruptly, and the scammers will demand payment in exchange for not releasing these items to the victim's family, friends or work colleagues.

Scam victims often lose money. In some cases, the scammer ends the relationship once the money has been sent. There’s often very little chance of getting the money back.

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've checked who they are

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to The Gambia to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

If you're travelling to The Gambia, your family and friends may receive bogus phone calls and emails from The Gambia. Scammers may claim that you're in legal, financial or medical trouble and that you need money.

To protect your family and friends from scammers:

* be careful about giving out personal information or disposing of personal documents while in The Gambia
* tell friends and family to contact you directly if they receive any emails about you

If friends and family can't contact you directly, they should contact the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

An attack could happen anywhere, at any time. This includes places visited by foreigners.

To reduce your risk of being involved in an attack:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report suspicious activity or items to police
* monitor the media for any new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities
