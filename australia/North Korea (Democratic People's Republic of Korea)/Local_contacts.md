#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy in North Korea. The [Australian Embassy in Seoul](http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/) provides consular assistance to Australians in North Korea, although our capacity to do so is very limited.

If you're arrested or detained, North Korean authorities may deny you consular access to Australian officials.

The [Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang](https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/north-korea-pyongyang/) serves as the 'protecting power' for Australia and provides limited emergency consular services. The Swedish Embassy may have reduced capacity to offer consular assistance, and North Korean authorities may deny access to consular officials.

If despite our advice, you travel to North Korea, consider registering your travel to North Korea by advising the Australian Embassy in Seoul.

If you require consular assistance, contact the [Australian Embassy in Seoul](https://southkorea.embassy.gov.au/) if you're able or the [Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang](https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/north-korea-pyongyang/).
