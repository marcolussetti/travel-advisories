#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to North Korea.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries.  Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Medications can be very hard to get in North Korea.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in North Korea. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* the required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk, especially in the country's south from May to September.

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) is also a risk.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel

#### Other health risks

* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases occur, including:
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

[Intestinal worm](https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/conditions/infectious+diseases/worms/worms+-+including+symptoms+treatment+and+prevention) infections, such as roundworm, are common. These can affect travellers.

Get advice on preventative medicine for intestinal worms.

#### Hand, foot and mouth disease

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) is common.

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. Outbreaks usually start in March and peak in May but can continue until October each year.

The disease mostly affects children aged under 10 years. Adult cases, especially in young adults, are not unusual.

Signs of HFMD include fever and blisters and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.

The disease is spread by direct contact with nose and throat discharges and faeces of infected people.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink bottled water from bottles with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* wash your hands frequently and thoroughly

#### Yellow dust

Strong winds from Mongolia and China carry yellow dust and other pollutants to the Korean Peninsula, particularly from March to May. 

The dust can:

* cause eye, nose, mouth and throat irritations
* make breathing and heart problems worse

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities is basic, and hygiene is poor, including in Pyongyang.

Avoid surgery unless you need it to leave North Korea.

The Friendship Hospital in the Munsudong District of Pyongyang may have English-speaking doctors for travellers. Like other hospitals in North Korea, it may:

* lack heating and medical supplies
* have power outages and other difficulties

The Friendship Hospital may not have strong infection control capabilities. Healthcare standards in North Korea mean that adequate care can't be provided to both residents and travellers in the event of a mass casualty incident or epidemic. 

The cost of medical treatment is high.

You may need to pay cash up-front, usually in euros, before a hospital will treat you.

Travelling from rural areas to Pyongyang for medical emergencies can be long and difficult.

#### Medical evacuation

North Korean authorities have severely restricted flights in and out of North Korea, making medical evacuation difficult.          

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to China for treatment. Contact the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang or if possible, the Australian Embassy in Seoul for assistance (see 'Local Contacts').

Medical evacuation can be very expensive. It can also be difficult to arrange quickly. You may face delays getting the required approvals or booking flights. There are few regular flights from North Korea.

You and your medical escorts will also need visas for [China](/destinations/asia/china "China") for evacuation. 

Authorities don't allow evacuation across the demilitarised zone to South Korea.
