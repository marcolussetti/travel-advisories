# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.  If you are arrested or detained, ask North Korean officials to notify the [Embassy of Sweden](https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/north-korea-pyongyang/) immediately.

Travelling as part of a tour or with a guide offers no special protection from North Korean laws. Follow all instructions from your tour operator and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your safety at risk. 

#### Arbitrary arrest and detention

Authorities have arrested and detained foreigners, including Australians.

Culture and politics influence authorities when making arrests, not just the law.

You may be arrested, detained or expelled for activities that aren't crimes in Australia.

Authorities closely watch travellers. They may search belongings in your hotel room or monitor your email, internet, phone and fax usage.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. Trafficking can result in an indefinite jail sentence.

Parole is rare in drug-related cases.

#### Other laws

Authorities arrest and detain people for many activities. Penalties can be very harsh.

Many seemingly innocent activities may be perceived as spying.

It's illegal to take photos of anything other than designated public tourist sites, including:

* roads and bridges
* airports
* rail stations
* ports
* government buildings
* scenes of poverty
* anything that may give a negative impression of North Korea

Always ask your North Korean guide for permission before taking photos.

It's illegal to:

* bring items that may be seen as religious, pornographic or political
* bring or view South Korean products or content
* not declare published material or electronic devices when you enter
* knowingly or unknowingly possess items that breach North Korean law
* show disrespect or make jokes about North Korea, current or former leaders or their families
* engage in an unauthorised currency transaction
* shop at stores not designated for foreigners

It's also illegal to talk to North Koreans without authorisation as this may be perceived as spying.

If you're involved in a civil or commercial dispute, authorities can stop you from leaving the country.

#### Australian laws

Australia has [sanctions against North Korea](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/sanctions-regimes/democratic-peoples-republic-korea-sanctions-regime). It is prohibited to supply, sell, or transfer to North Korea (directly or indirectly) goods other than food and medicine unless authorised. It is also prohibited to procure or receive goods other than food and medicine from North Korea unless authorised. Be aware that Australia's sanctions prohibit the transfer of luxury goods to North Korea.

Australians travelling to North Korea can carry items on the luxury goods lists for personal use only. You must not sell or give these items to others.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

North Korea doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide if you're arrested or detained. This includes if you're an Australian of Korean heritage, including if you're originally from South Korea.

If you're a South Korean-Australian dual citizen, you may need to get approval from South Korean authorities to travel to North Korea.

Get advice from a [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) before you travel.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships and homosexuality aren't explicitly criminalised, but same-sex relationships aren't legally recognised. There are reports of executions due to homosexuality.
