[Do not travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained#level4) to North Korea due to the different laws affecting visitors, including the risk of arbitrary detention and the uncertain security situation.

## Overview

### Safety

* Travelling as part of a tour or with a guide doesn't give you special protection from North Korean laws. Authorities may arrest, detain or expel you for activities that aren't crimes in Australia.  Even if you meet all entry requirements, you may still be arbitrarily arrested and/or detained at your point of entry.
* North Korea and South Korea are technically still at war, and tensions on the Korean Peninsula can increase with little warning. North Korea regularly conducts missile launches or other provocations, raising regional tensions. Monitor developments.
* The North Korean Government restricts information, especially about domestic politics and international relations. You may be able to access international satellite TV channels at some tourist hotels. However, if the government shuts these down in a crisis, you may not know what's happening. Monitor state broadcasts and, if possible, international media for signs of increasing tensions.
* Crime against travellers is rare. However, some travellers have reported petty crimes. Keep your passport and belongings close, especially at Pyongyang Airport and public markets.
* The rainy season is from June to August, and typhoons can occur in August and September. Excessive rain can cause flooding and landslides, damage housing and infrastructure, and disrupt essential services. Know your hotel's evacuation plan.
* Earthquakes are rare on the Korean Peninsula, but tsunamis caused by earthquakes are a risk. Know the tsunami warning signs and move to high ground straight away. Don't wait for official alerts, warnings or sirens.

### Health

* Medical facilities are basic, including in Pyongyang, and hygiene is poor. Avoid surgery unless you need it to leave North Korea.
* If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation to China for treatment. Contact the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang or, if possible, the Australian Embassy in Seoul for assistance. Medical evacuations are very expensive and difficult to organise. Ensure your travel insurance covers this. Most Australian insurance policies won't cover you for travel to North Korea.
* Insect-borne, waterborne, foodborne, and other infectious diseases are risks in North Korea. Ensure you have the appropriate vaccinations and bring preventative medication. Practice good personal hygiene, avoid raw or undercooked foods and drink only boiled or bottled water.
* Medications can be very hard to get in North Korea. If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.
* From March to May, strong winds can carry yellow dust and other pollutants from Mongolia and China to the Korean Peninsula. This can cause eye, nose, mouth and throat irritations. Get medical advice if you have heart or breathing problems.

### Local laws

* Travelling as part of a tour or with a guide doesn't give you special protection from North Korean laws. Authorities may arrest, detain or expel you for activities that aren't crimes in Australia. Authorities have arrested and detained foreigners.
* Authorities may also search your belongings and monitor your communications. Follow the guidance of your tour operator and the local authorities. Failure to do so could put your safety at risk.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe, and there's no guarantee of access to full legal services. Drug traffickers can get indefinite jail sentences.
* Authorities may judge many activities as spying. Be very careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph anything other than designated public tourist sites. Always ask your North Korean guide for permission before taking photos.
* North Korea has strict laws about what you can bring into the country. It's illegal to bring in South Korean content, religious, pornographic or political items. Declare all published material and electronic devices when you arrive. It's also illegal to knowingly or unknowingly possess items that breach North Korean law.
* Be careful who you talk to and what you say. It's illegal to show disrespect or make jokes about North Korea, current or former leaders or their families. It's also illegal to talk to North Koreans without authorisation. Authorities may consider it spying if you do. Only shop at stores designated for foreigners.
* North Korea doesn't recognise dual nationality. The North Korean authorities may permit limited or no consular assistance to detained dual nationals, including Australians of Korean heritage, including those originally from South Korea. Australian-South Korean dual nationals may need permission from South Korean authorities to travel to North Korea.

### Travel

* If, despite our advice, you travel to North Korea, you'll need a visa for all types of travel. North Korea doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Australia. This means you need to travel to another country, such as China, to get your visa. If you're travelling for business, you'll need a North Korean sponsor and permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Journalists must get a special visa.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of North Korea for the latest details. Even if you meet all entry requirements, you still may be arbitrarily arrested and/or detained at your point of entry.
* Travel within North Korea is severely restricted. You can only travel on an official tour. An official guide must always accompany you. Charges for travel can be high, including for taxis, guides, tolls and permits. Follow all instructions from your guide.
* If you intend to travel to North Korea, you may have to travel via Beijing, requiring a double-or multiple-entry visa for China. Without such a visa, you won't be able to re-enter China when you leave North Korea. Contact the [Embassy or Consulate of the People's Republic of China](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/44) for details.
* You must register with North Korean government authorities within 24 hours of arriving. Do this through your host organisation or hotel.
* Communications are unreliable and severely restricted. If, despite our advice, you travel to North Korea, discuss a communications plan with your friends and family and share details about your planned travel.
* Foreigners aren't permitted to use local currency. Foreigners must use foreign currency. The Euro is the most widely accepted foreign currency. US dollars and Chinese yuan are also widely accepted. Exchanging currencies is difficult. You can't use ATMs, traveller's cheques, or debit and credit cards.
