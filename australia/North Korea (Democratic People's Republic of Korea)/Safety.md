# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Regional threats

Armed conflict during the 1950-53 Korean War ended with the signing of the armistice agreement, but South Korea and North Korea remain technically at war and relations are tense. A demilitarised zone (DMZ) separates the Korean Peninsula roughly in half between the North (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and the South (Republic of Korea).

Low-level military clashes have occurred between South Korea and North Korea, including across the DMZ and along the Northern Limit Line in the sea to the west of the Korean Peninsula.

The security situation on the Korean Peninsula can deteriorate with little warning.

North Korea regularly takes provocative actions, including conducting ballistic missile launches, sending 'trash balloons', and, sometimes, undertaking nuclear weapons tests or other threatening or belligerent behaviours. These activities increase tension in the region and can occur with little warning.

North Korea regularly makes hostile statements about other countries, including Australia.

North Korea says it can't guarantee the safety of embassies and international organisations in the country if there's conflict.

In the event of such threats:

* monitor developments
* take official warnings seriously
* leave when it's safe to do so.

#### Access to information

North Korea is a closed society.

Authorities restrict access to information. What's available is unreliable. There's very little, if any, information about internal politics.

You can usually access international satellite TV channels at hotels that international travellers use, although these are often censored and can be quickly disrupted.

Civil unrest, internal instability or tension on the Korean Peninsula could rise quickly. Your access to information via international news channels can be quickly cut off.

If, despite the risks, you travel to North Korea:

* take the necessary precautions to ensure your safety, develop a communications plan with your friends and family and share details about your planned travel
* pay close attention to your personal security
* monitor state broadcasts and other local sources for signs of rising tension, civil unrest or internal instability
* if possible, monitor international media for security risks
* you should notify the Australian Embassy in Seoul of your travel plans
* understand that you could be arbitrarily detained. Make sure you have an [up-to-date will](/before-you-go/health/death "What happens if you die overseas and how you can prepare") and enduring power of attorney. Designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries.

#### Crime

Crime against travellers is rare. However, some travellers have reported petty crimes.

Keep your passport and belongings close, particularly:

* at Pyongyang airport
* in public markets

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat world-wide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners where large crowds may gather.

#### Climate and natural disasters

North Korea experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [flooding and landslides](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters)
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [typhoons](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

In an emergency, our ability to provide consular assistance, if any, will likely be severely limited.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* exercise caution
* stay away from affected areas
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media and other sources
* keep in contact with friends and family

Check with a tour operator or guide before travelling to affected areas.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Typhoons and severe weather

The monsoon season is usually from June to August.

Excessive rainfall during summer can cause severe flooding and landslides and damage to housing and infrastructure. Flash flooding can occur.

The typhoon season is usually from August to September. 

If a typhoon is approaching, stay inside.  The direction and strength of typhoons can change with little warning.

If a typhoon approaches:

* know your hotel evacuation plans
* identify your local shelter

If you stay:

* adequate shelter might not be available
* flights could be delayed, suspended or fill quickly
* ports may close

Contact your tour operator or guide for updates.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

[Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") can occur on the Korean Peninsula, although less frequently than in surrounding regions such as Japan and China.

Tsunamis are a risk. Large earthquakes in surrounding regions can cause destructive tsunamis that may affect the Korean Peninsula. If you're in a coastal region after a major earthquake, move to higher ground immediately.

If there's an [earthquake or tsunami](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"):

* follow our advice for natural disasters
* move to higher ground right away if you're on the coast.

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, follow the instructions from your guide.
