#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If, despite our advice, you travel to North Korea, you need a visa for all types of travel.

If you arrive without a valid visa, you may be:

* detained
* arrested
* fined
* denied entry

There is no longer a North Korean embassy or consulate in Australia, meaning you need to travel to another country, such as China or Indonesia, to get your visa for North Korea.

You may need to provide recent international travel itineraries to apply for a visa. You may also have to show these when you arrive in North Korea.

#### Other visas

Business travellers generally need:

* sponsorship by a North Korean organisation
* permission from the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Professional journalists must apply for special permission to visit. Authorities do not permit journalists to enter the country on a tourist visa.

Even if you meet all entry requirements, you may still be arbitrarily arrested and/or detained at your point of entry.

Entry and exit conditions change regularly. Contact the [Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/104) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

You'll likely need a double or multiple-entry visa for China if you're travelling through China to or from North Korea. Otherwise, you won't be able to re-enter China when you leave North Korea. Contact the [Embassy or Consulate of the People's Republic of China](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/44) for details.

#### Other formalities

Australia has sanctions against North Korea that limit what you can take with you. See Local laws.

When entering North Korea, you need to declare all:

* published material, such as books, academic papers and pamphlets
* communications devices, such as mobile phones, satellite phones, GPS receivers and radios

Assume that authorities will inspect published material and electronic devices and possibly confiscate them. Speak to your tour operator if you have concerns.

If authorities don't confiscate your controlled items, you may need to leave them at the customs checkpoints. You may be able to collect them when you leave.

#### Quarantine

You may be quarantined if you show medical symptoms of a serious communicable disease.

#### Register on arrival

Travellers must register with government authorities within 24 hours of arrival in North Korea. You can do this through your host organisation.

If you stay in a hotel, confirm at check-in that your hotel will take care of your registration.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/australian-embassy-korea-republic-of.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the North Korean Won (KPW). Foreigners are not allowed to use the North Korean Won. Foreigners are required to use foreign currency.

The Euro is the most widely accepted foreign currency. US dollars and Chinese yuan are also widely accepted.

Changing currencies in North Korea is difficult.

ATMs aren't available.

Banking facilities are limited, and traveller's cheques aren't accepted.

You can't use a debit or credit card to withdraw cash from a bank.

Some shops and restaurants catering to travellers might convert foreign currency so you can pay.

Use cash. Take small denominations of foreign currency, as you may not be able to get change from large denominations.

#### Local travel

North Korea doesn't allow independent tourism. Authorities restrict travel within the country.

Authorities only allow tourism in groups organised by North Korean officials or approved travel agencies.

An official guide must always accompany travellers. Follow all instructions from your guide.

You may have to show your identity documents at police checkpoints when entering and leaving towns.

Travellers often report that charges for travel can be high and arbitrary, including charges for:

* taxis
* hire vehicles
* guides
* tolls
* permits

#### Communications

Assume that authorities are monitoring all your phone conversations, including on your mobile, even if it wasn't confiscated when you arrived.

International phone lines may be disconnected without notice.

Some hotels in Pyongyang allow direct dial international phone calls. Charges are high.

Internet access is severely restricted and may be monitored.

Communications are unreliable.

Direct telephone calls to or from South Korea aren't possible.

You may not be able to contact your family and friends easily.

If, despite our advice, you travel to North Korea, discuss and agree on a communications plan with your family and friends before you depart.

#### Necessities

You can buy food and clean water with hard currency at some hotels and restaurants.

Energy and pharmaceutical shortages are common.

#### Road travel

Tour operators or sponsors usually provide road transportation.

Expect regular delays with vehicles and passengers needing to clear through checkpoints.

Highways are relatively good. Rural and some suburban roads can be in a poor state.

#### Public transport

Authorities restrict foreigners’ use of [public transport](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport"), including the rail network.

Ask your tour operator or sponsor about public transport or rail travel.

If you're travelling by train, expect long delays due to power outages.

#### Sea travel

Many coastal areas are sensitive.

If you travel to North Korea by sea, your vessel could be detained or fired on.

#### Air travel

Flights to and from North Korea are regularly cancelled or delayed.

Sanctions are in place that affect North Korean service providers, including airlines. Check with your tour operator or airline before you travel.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [North Korea's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=P) with the Aviation Safety Network.
