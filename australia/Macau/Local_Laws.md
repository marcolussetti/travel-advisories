# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Macau's Law on Safeguarding National Security could be interpreted broadly. You could break the law without intending to. The law could be applied to activities that occurred outside Macau, including social media posts.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Australian Government can't intervene in the Macau judicial process.

If local authorities consider you a Chinese citizen, they may refuse access to Australian consular services. This will prevent the Australian Government from providing you with those services.

#### Drugs

Possessing illegal drugs of any kind, including marijuana, can result in penalties that include heavy fines and jail time.

#### Weapons

Macau has strict laws around importing and possessing weapons. This includes stun guns, tasers and items that look like weapons, such as:

* replicas
* antiques
* toys
* fashion accessories

You must have a permit to import, possess or buy these items. This includes items sold in local markets. Apply in advance for a permit from local authorities.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to:

* join a public protest without Macau government approval
* take photos of military installations

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

While Macau’s law allows dual nationals of Chinese descent to register their Australian nationality, China’s Nationality Law prevents legal recognition of dual citizenship in Macau.  
Local authorities may deny you access to Australian consular services if they identify you as a Chinese citizen.

This can happen even if you entered Macau on an Australian or other foreign passport and you:

* meet the conditions to be recognised as Chinese citizen
* haven't renounced your Chinese citizenship according to Chinese law
* haven't formally advised the Chinese authorities of your Australian citizenship
* continue to maintain a passport issued by the Macau Special Administrative Region or by China.

Authorities may not allow certain categories of Chinese citizens, such as state officials, to renounce their Chinese nationality under Chinese law.

Get professional legal advice if you're not sure of your citizenship status under Chinese law.

If you plan to enter mainland China or Hong Kong from Macau, travel on your Australian passport.

Local authorities may not allow consular access if you enter Macau on a travel document other than your Australian passport or if local authorities identify you as a Chinese national.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Most people in Macau accept or are indifferent to LGBTQIA+ travellers. However, community attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ people are generally more conservative than in Australia.
