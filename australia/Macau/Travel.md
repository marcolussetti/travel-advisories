#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. It has separate visa and entry administration to Hong Kong and mainland China.

You generally won't need a visa for a visit less than 30 days. However, entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules, contact or visit:

* [Macau Immigration Service](https://www.fsm.gov.mo)
* [Macau Government Tourist Office](http://en.macautourism.gov.mo/plan/beforeyoutravel.php)

If you need a visa, apply for it through your nearest [PRC embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/44).

The paper slip provided upon entry to Macau includes your date of entry and your latest departure date. The slip is needed at hotel check-in and when requested by local authorities. [Replacement slips](https://www.gov.mo/en/services/ps-1474/ps-1474d/) are available from the Macau Border Control Department or a police station.

#### Travel between Macau and mainland China

See the [Embassy of the People's Republic of China](https://www.visaforchina.cn/globle/) for eligibility requirements and visa types.

If you plan to return to mainland China after visiting Macau, confirm your Chinese visa allows you to re-enter mainland China. 

If you've recently changed your passport, but your Chinese visa is still in the old passport, take both passports with you. Officials may ask you to present your previous passport and Chinese visa.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Macau, you need both:

* a valid international driving permit (IDP)

If you stay in Macau longer than 14 days, you must [register your driving licence](https://www.gov.mo/en/services/ps-1488/ps-1488a/) with the Macau Public Security Police Force (CPSP).

Get your IDP in Australia before you leave.

You may not be covered by your travel and vehicle insurances if you drive without an IDP.

#### Road travel

Macau has a well-developed road network of standards similar to those of an Australian city.

Check you have adequate insurance before driving.

#### Taxis and ridesharing services

Use only licensed taxis or reputable limousine services. Arrange them through your hotel if you can. Always insist that the meter is used and be prepared to pay cash for taxis. Many taxis don't have seatbelts available for use in the back seat.

Rideshare services are illegal in Macau. Police have issued fines to drivers and passengers of unlicensed taxi services.

#### Public transport

Public buses are inexpensive and frequent. However, you may have difficulty finding them outside major tourist areas. Drivers generally have limited English.
