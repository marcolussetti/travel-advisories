#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

It’s illegal to protest without approval from the Macau government. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Avoid protests, demonstrations and large gatherings.

Don't photograph, film or participate in protests or other acts that authorities may consider provocative.

If there are signs of disorder, move away quickly and seek shelter in a safe place.

Increased screening, including of digital devices, is possible for travellers crossing between Macau and mainland China.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To avoid the risk of violent unrest:

* avoid large gatherings and protests
* monitor the media for possible unrest and avoid those areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

There's little violent crime in Macau. You could encounter pickpocketing and street theft.  
  
Thieves target tourist spots and crowded places such as crowded shopping areas, markets and casinos.  
  
Take care of your belongings, especially in crowded places.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

To reduce your risk of drink spiking:

* be careful of people who approach you in bars, clubs and casinos
* don't accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new friends
* don't leave food or drinks unattended

#### Scams

Scams against travellers are increasing.

Criminals sometimes present themselves as people in need.

Scams can start via the internet. A person might offer you gift cards or money to help carry someone's luggage on an international flight. They may ask for your money, credit card or online bank account details.

Other reported scams involve:

* fake arrests
* property
* holiday club or timeshare schemes
* scratch lottery tickets
* foreign lottery schemes
* relationships
* people impersonating government officials

Be wary of strangers asking for your help.

Never carry anything for anyone you don't know and trust, especially when crossing international borders. There's a risk that criminals have hidden drugs or other illegal items inside.

To avoid becoming a victim of a scam:

* don't send money or give credit card or bank account details to anyone you don't know and trust
* thoroughly research any scheme or agreement before signing or paying money
* seek legal advice before signing any property contract

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Local safety rules require businesses and transport services to close during typhoons or very heavy rain.

* monitor weather forecasts and plan accordingly
