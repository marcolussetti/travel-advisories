## Overview

### Safety

* Violent crime is rare in Macau, but some petty crime happens. Thieves target tourist spots and crowded places, such as shopping centres, markets, the airport and casinos. Take care of your belongings.
* Drink spiking happens. Don't accept food, drink, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Don’t leave your food or drinks unattended.
* Scammers may ask for help carrying luggage or ask for money. Never carry anything for someone you don't know. Get legal advice before sending money or signing documents.
* Protests can turn violent. It's illegal to protest without Macau government approval. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Macau experiences typhoons and flooding of low-lying areas. These can disrupt transport and essential services. Typhoon season is between May and October. Follow the advice of local officials and contact your travel operator about delays.

### Health

* Macau has very high humidity from May to October and can have very high pollution levels. If you have a heart or breathing condition, minimise physical and outdoor activities when the air quality index health risk is high and on very humid days.
* Macau sometimes has outbreaks of dengue. Japanese encephalitis is also a risk.
* Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is common. Wash your hands thoroughly and often.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases include tuberculosis and hepatitis. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Avoid contact with animals.
* Macau's medical facilities are adequate. You may need to pay up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation to Hong Kong. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Macau's Law on Safeguarding National Security may be interpreted broadly, and you could break the law without intending to. The law could be applied to activities that occurred outside Macau, including social media posts.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties include heavy fines and jail terms.
* Chinese law doesn't recognise dual nationality. The Australian Government may be unable to help if you enter Macau on a travel document other than your Australian passport or if you're deemed a Chinese citizen. If you're travelling from Macau to Hong Kong or mainland China, use your Australian passport.
* If Macau authorities consider you a Chinese citizen, they may refuse access to Australian consular services. Get legal advice if you’re unsure of your citizenship under Chinese and Macau law.

### Travel

* Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. It has separate visa and entry administration to Hong Kong and mainland China. You generally won’t need a visa for a visit less than 30 days. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of China for the latest tourist, business and student visa information.
* If you plan to return to mainland China after visiting Macau, confirm your Chinese visa allows you to re-enter mainland China. Check with the [Embassy of the People's Republic of China](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/44) for eligibility requirements and visa types.
* The local currency is the Macanese Pataca (MOP). Some shops and buses also accept Hong Kong dollars and Chinese yuan. Most places accept credit cards.
* Only use licensed taxis or reputable limousine services. Insist on using the meter.
