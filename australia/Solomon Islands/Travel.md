#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You can get a 'Border' visa on arrival for stays of up to 45 days. A border visa is issued once during a calendar year. For stays of more than 45 days, you must apply for the relevant visa with the [Ministry of Commerce, Industry, Labour and Immigration](https://commerce.gov.sb/departments-units/immigration/visas/i-want-to-apply-for-a.html).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Solomon Islands High Commission](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/182) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

To enter Solomon Islands, it's recommended that you have proof of vaccination against measles. Acceptable proof includes either:

* a vaccine (yellow) card or other document which states the measles vaccine was administered at least 15 days before your arrival
* a letter from your doctor stating you’ve had a measles blood test and the test shows you’re protected or immune from measles

If you don’t provide this evidence, you may be requested to report for an examination by medical authorities. Bring your official vaccination record with you.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Solomon Islands, like many other countries, won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. Get a new passport if you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy, high commission or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Solomon Islands Dollar (SBD).

You must declare all amounts over SBD50,000 or foreign currency equivalent on arrival or departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

International credit cards are accepted at hotels, resorts and major shops in Honiara. Credit card facilities are rarely available elsewhere.

You can change currency and access ATMs at the airport and commercial banks in Honiara and other major centres.

#### Local travel

#### Unexploded weapons

Remnants of war are still widely present throughout Solomon Islands.

Areas affected by war include:

* Hell's Point, Honiara and surrounding ridges
* the New Georgia group of islands
* the former capital of Tulagi
* the Russell Islands

The condition and stability of the weapons are unknown.

Get local advice before you travel to these areas. Take care when hiking, boating or diving.

#### Telecommunications

Mobile and internet services can be limited in some areas of Solomon Islands.

Solomon Islands’ telecommunication operate on 3G and LTE (4G). Roaming capabilities may be affected if your device is not configured for these networks.

Have backup communications plans, such as agreed check-in points with others who know your expected movements or alternative communications methods, such as satellite phones and Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB).

#### Driving permit

To drive in Solomon Islands, you'll need both:

* a valid international driving permit (IDP)
* your current Australian driver's licence

Driving without an IDP can void your travel and vehicle insurance.

After 3 months, you'll need to get a local driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Most roads in Solomon Islands are in a very poor state of repair.

Large potholes are common. Local drivers swerve or slow suddenly to avoid potholes, including on the main road in Honiara.

Vehicles are generally poorly maintained.

Traffic lanes and road rules are often ignored, particularly at roundabouts and other intersections.

Pedestrians often walk on roads. Take caution when driving off the main highway.

Traffic jams are common in Honiara.

If you plan to drive:

* learn local laws and driving practices
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* avoid driving at night, where possible
* follow instructions if stopped by police
* allow plenty of time to reach your destination

If rocks are thrown at your car, leave the area quickly and safely.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and authorised limousines. Arrange these through your hotel.

#### Public transport

There's no formal public transport system in Solomon Islands. Privately owned passenger vans, small buses, and trucks provide transport in most areas with roads.

A limited minibus system operates in Honiara.

Take care of your belongings due to petty theft.

#### Boat travel

[Travel by boat](/node/359) in Solomon Islands can be dangerous.

Passenger ferry services are subject to disruption at short notice.

Overcrowding of passenger ferries is common.

Consider flying to your destination rather than taking a passenger ferry.

There are limited marine search-and-rescue services in Solomon Islands.

To protect yourself when travelling by boat:

* carry your own life jacket, an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and a satellite telephone
* avoid single-engine boats
* travel in convoy with all boats at half capacity or less
* register your departures and arrivals with a friend

#### Air travel

Airport infrastructure across the country may be maintained to a different standard than in Australia, including emergency response vehicles.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Solomon Islands' air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=H4) with the Aviation Safety Network.
