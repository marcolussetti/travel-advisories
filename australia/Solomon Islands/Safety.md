#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Expatriates have been targets of violent crime, including home invasions.

Crimes that might affect you in Solomon Islands include:

* house break-ins
* vehicle break-ins
* indecent exposure at guesthouses and in public places, including beaches

Verbal harassment, intimidation and [assault](/node/354) can also happen at nightclubs or bars.

Serious attacks can also happen, including carjacking, [robbery](/node/344) and [sexual assault](/node/355).

Women alone in public places are at the most risk.

Instances of harassment and assaults, resulting in serious injury, have occurred at popular tourist sites, including beaches close to Honiara.

There have been reports of youths blocking roads in the suburbs and on the outskirts of Honiara under the guise of collecting fees for road maintenance.

Crime usually increases:

* after political instability
* around Christmas
* before major holidays
* during times of civil unrest

To protect yourself from crimes:

* lock doors, windows and gates at your accommodation, even if you have security guards
* lock vehicle windows and doors, even when moving
* don’t walk, jog or cycle after dark.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty Crime

Keep your money and phone secure at all times.

Avoid being alone in remote and unfamiliar places.

Don't walk, jog or cycle alone after dark or in the early hours of the morning.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis

Solomon Islands is in an earthquake zone. Volcanic eruptions and tsunamis can also happen.

In November 2022, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck 53km south-west of Honiara, Guadalcanal Province. Earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 and above are felt routinely throughout Solomon Islands.

The island of Savo, 35km northwest of Honiara, is an active volcano. It has recently experienced an increase in seismic activity. Before travelling to the island, you should check for updates from local authorities, including the Solomon Islands [National Disaster Management Office](https://solomons.gov.sb/category/ndmo/). Savo last erupted between 1835 and 1847.

To protect yourself if there's an earthquake:

* monitor [The US Tsunami Warning System](https://www.tsunami.gov/) and other local sources

Move to higher ground if you're near the coast or a low-lying area.

For real-time information on earthquakes, check the [US Geological Service](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map).
