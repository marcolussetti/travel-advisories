# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

It is illegal for those under the age of 21 to consume or be supplied with alcohol.

It's illegal to import or possess pornographic material.

Solomon Islands doesn’t recognise same sex relationships. It is a criminal offence to engage in same-sex sexual activity. Penalties include jail sentences.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Solomon Islands introduced legislation to recognise dual citizenship in late 2020.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits our consular services if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/node/118).
