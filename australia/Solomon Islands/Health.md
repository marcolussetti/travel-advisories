#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Solomon Islands. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

If you are uncertain about your medication, seek approval from the local Ministry of Health and Medical Services.

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Mosquito-borne diseases are prevalent in Solomon Islands. [Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) and [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) are widespread across Solomon Islands.

Dengue outbreaks have occurred in the past. The Solomon Islands Public Health Emergency and Surveillance Unit continues to monitor for more outbreaks.

Malaria is found in most areas of Solomon Islands and occurs throughout the year.

[Zika](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) virus and chikungunya are also found in Solomon Islands. There's no vaccination for Zika virus.

The Australian Department of Health and Aged Care's Zika virus bulletin includes advice on how to minimise Zika virus risks.

If you're pregnant, it is recommended that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medication to prevent malaria.

#### Rotavirus

Solomon Islands has experienced outbreaks of [rotavirus](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/rotavirus) that have caused deaths, particularly among children.

Rotavirus is highly contagious and spreads through:

* person-to-person contact
* contaminated objects
* contaminated food or drink

A rotavirus vaccine for infants up to 6 months of age is available under the Australian National Immunisation Program.

You can stop the spread of rotavirus.

To protect yourself from rotavirus, wash your hands thoroughly for 10 seconds using soap and water and dry with a clean towel:

* after going to the toilet
* after caring for someone with diarrhoea
* before preparing or touching food
* before eating food

If children show signs of diarrhoea, seek medical attention.

#### Other infectious diseases

Foodborne, waterborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur in Solomon Islands. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [sexually transmitted infections](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis))

To reduce your risk of illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food

Get medical advice if you suspect poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Fish poisoning

Eating reef fish can result in [ciguatera poisoning](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ciguatera-poisoning). Ciguatera is a naturally occurring seafood toxin.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities, rescue and emergency services throughout Solomon Islands are very limited.  
  
If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to Australia. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and time-consuming. The medical evacuation process currently takes 1-5 days to complete. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for medical evacuations.  
  
The hyperbaric chamber in Honiara has basic functionality but is not capable of providing any in-chamber life support. If you experience decompression sickness (DCS) as a result of scuba diving, you may still require specialised transport to transfer you to another country for treatment. Ensure you have appropriate insurance coverage if you plan to undertake risky activities like diving. 

If you're contemplating scuba activities, you should obtain appropriate insurance and contact [Divers Alert Network](https://dan.org/) for the most up-to-date advice.
