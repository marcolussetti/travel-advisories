#### Terrorism

There's an increased risk of terrorism in Kuwait, including threats against military bases. Maintain a high level of security awareness and be aware of your surroundings. Follow the advice of local authorities.

There have been several terrorist attacks in the Gulf region in recent years, including at places visited by foreigners. Take official warnings seriously. In case of an attack, follow the advice of local authorities.

Attacks could occur at any time and targets could include:

* places of worship
* hotels and restaurants
* sporting venues
* military sites
* transport hubs
* crowded public places
* shopping malls and markets
* other locations foreigners may visit

Maintain a high level of security awareness. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Conflicts in the Middle East and Gulf region could affect Kuwait. Monitor local and international media.

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests occur Kuwait. Kuwaiti law permits freedom of assembly for its citizens. It's illegal for non-Kuwait nationals to protest in Kuwait.

Organisers of demonstrations or public gatherings must obtain approval in advance from the Ministry of Interior (MOI). 

Events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Protesters and security forces have clashed previously. Security forces have used water cannons and tear gas to break up protests.

Avoid all protests, demonstrations and large public gatherings.

Be especially alert for protest activity in:

* Areas surrounding Irada Square
* Jahra

During a period of unrest:

* monitor the media and local sources for new threats
* plan your activities to avoid days of national or commemorative significance
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to change your travel plans

Contact your airline, travel agent or insurer if your travel is disrupted.

#### Crime

The overall crime rate in Kuwait is low but it is higher in some areas.

Some travellers have reported being physically and verbally harassed. Some foreigners have reported being followed at night.

Take care if you intend to travel to Jahra, where attackers have used firearms in confrontations. [Robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) have occurred in Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be alert to petty thieves while in crowded places
* carry only what you need – leave other valuables in a secure place
* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour

#### Sexual Assault

Victims of sexual assault in Kuwait may face arrest, detention or criminal prosecution for having sex outside of marriage and/or adultery.

If you are sexually assaulted in Kuwait, contact the Australian Embassy in Kuwait or the Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra immediately.

While consular officers can't provide legal or medical advice, they can provide a list of English-speaking service providers, such as lawyers and translators, who may be able to help.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
