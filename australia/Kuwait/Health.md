#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, such as opiate-based medications, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor. Some medications require approval from the Ministry of Health.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Kuwait by contacting the Kuwaiti Embassy in Australia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

#### Health risks

#### MERS

Cases of [Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-mers) have been reported in Kuwait.

Avoid contact with camels. Don't consume raw camel milk, undercooked camel meat, or anything contaminated with camel secretions.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, cough, breathing difficulties or diarrhoea.

#### Air quality

Air pollution levels in Kuwait are often at dangerous levels, increasing the risk of breathing problems.

Dust and sandstorms can be severe and occur throughout the year.

Poor air quality can cause:

* traffic delays and accidents
* flight delays

People who have pre-existing medical conditions, particularly heart and lung conditions, may be especially affected. If you're concerned:

* seek medical advice
* follow advice from local authorities about methods to reduce exposure
* monitor an air quality index
* reduce your exposure

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in Kuwait varies in government-run and private institutions. You'll be expected to pay in advance for all services. Some hospitals only accept citizens, and some treatments and medicines may not be available to foreigners. Government facilities offer more specialty care services, though wait times are often long and can be difficult to access for non-nationals.

Married women may be required to obtain their husband's permission before some medical procedures.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

If you need a complex procedure or become seriously ill, you may need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
