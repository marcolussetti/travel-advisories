# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Kuwaiti authorities don't normally notify the Australian Embassy if they detain or arrest Australians.

If you are detained, ask the authorities, your family, friend or colleague to inform the Embassy as soon as possible.

#### Drugs and alcohol

Possession of illicit drugs and alcohol is illegal. Penalties are severe.  
Convictions for possession and trafficking of drugs may result in heavy fines, lengthy jail sentences, deportation or the death penalty.

It is illegal to bring alcohol into Kuwait and possess or consume it in the country.

Public intoxication or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is punishable by fines, imprisonment, deportation and confiscation of your driving licence.

#### Commercial, civil, family and employment law

Australian and Kuwaiti laws are very different. This includes laws about:

* commercial arrangements
* civil matters
* family matters
* employment.

Seemingly minor incidents can result in lengthy legal proceedings. If you have an open case, you may be prevented from leaving the country until it’s resolved.

Some offences that aren't serious in Australia are extremely serious in Kuwait. This includes:

* writing a cheque without enough funds in your account
* not paying your bills.

We can't interfere in commercial and family disputes.

If you're involved in local legal matters:

* seek professional advice
* understand your rights and what you must do under Kuwaiti law.

This is particularly the case for family law matters, including:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support.

Kuwaiti authorities require that documents issued in Australia are both:

* authenticated by DFAT before you leave Australia
* authenticated by officials at the Australian Embassy in Kuwait.

Types of documents you'll need to authenticate include:

* academic records
* a marriage certificate or driver's licence for a residency permit
* employment permits
* a driver's licence for other purposes.

#### Other laws

Always carry ID, such as your passport or a Kuwaiti civil identity card.

Authorities conduct regular checks for illegal workers.

It's illegal to:

* use social media to criticise regional political matters and figures, including the Amir, Crown Prince and Prime Minister
* challenge or insult the Kuwait leadership in any way, including in speech, writing or drawing
* import alcohol (also see Drugs and alcohol section above), pork products or pornography
* drive without a valid licence
* drink and drive
* take photos or videos of Government buildings or military sites, oil fields, and people (particularly local women) without permission.

#### Traffic incidents

If you receive a traffic violation or are involved in an accident, you cannot leave Kuwait until the matter is resolved and relevant fines are paid.

#### Sex and intimacy laws

It's illegal to:

* have sex outside of marriage
* cohabitate with someone of the opposite sex if unmarried. It's illegal to stay in a hotel room with someone of the opposite sex unless you're married to them. The hotel staff may ask you for a marriage certificate
* engage in intimate public displays of affection.
* de-facto relationships are not recognised in Kuwait

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Same-sex relationships and impersonating the opposite sex are illegal. Kuwait doesn't recognise or allow same-sex marriages and rights. Punishments can include fines, imprisonment and deportation.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationals

Kuwait doesn't recognise dual nationality. Authorities have revoked people's Kuwaiti citizenship for reasons including dual nationality.

If you're a dual national and authorities arrest or detain you, our ability to deliver consular services may be limited.

Kuwaiti authorities have confiscated the [Australian passports](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services") of dual citizens. This doesn't deprive you of your Australian citizenship.

If this happens, contact the Australian Embassy. See [Local contacts](#local-contacts)

#### Local customs

Kuwait is a Muslim country. Respect local traditions, customs and religious beliefs. Cover your shoulders and knees, avoid wearing shorts or tight clothing and behave modestly in public, government buildings and places of worship. 

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is strictly observed in Kuwait. Take care not to offend others.

During Ramadan, it is illegal to eat, drink or smoke in public during the day. If you are not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are.
