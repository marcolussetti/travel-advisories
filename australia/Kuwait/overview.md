## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. There is an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests across the region.
* Conflicts in the Middle East could affect Kuwait. Monitor local and international media. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local officials.
* There's an increased risk of terrorism in Kuwait, including threats against military bases. Maintain a high level of security awareness and be aware of your surroundings. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Demonstrations and protests occur and can turn violent quickly. Protesters and security forces have clashed. Avoid large public gatherings. Take care, especially around Friday prayer times. It is illegal for non-Kuwaiti nationals to protest in Kuwait.
* Kuwait's crime rate is low. Armed robberies have been reported, notably in Jahra and Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh.
* Driving can be dangerous due to high speeds and reckless driving, especially at night. Avoid driving on unmarked roads.
* Be prepared for extreme weather conditions. Sand and dust storms occur regularly. In the hottest months, between June and September, the temperatures are often above 50°C. Flooding can occur between December and January. Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Some medical facilities offer high-quality services, but others don't. Some public hospitals don't accept foreign nationals. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need to be medically evacuated. Ensure your travel insurance covers this. Medical evacuation can be expensive and hard to organise.

* It's illegal to buy, sell, import, carry and consume alcohol. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment and deportation. It's also illegal to possess, consume, produce or traffic drugs in Kuwait. Penalties are severe and can include large fines, imprisonment or the death sentence.
* Get professional, local, legal advice for any business or family law matters. Some offences that aren't serious in Australia are very serious in Kuwait.
* Kuwait has strict laws regarding its head of state, the Amir, the Crown Prince and the Prime Minister. It's illegal to challenge or insult the Kuwait leadership any way. It's also illegal to use social media to criticise regional political matters and figures, including the Amir, Crown Prince and the Prime Minister.
* Kuwait has strict laws on relationships and LGBTQIA+ issues. Same-sex relations and impersonating the opposite sex are illegal. Kuwait doesn’t recognise diverse gender identities. It's against the law for unmarried couples to live or stay together in hotel rooms. Public displays of affection between men and women are also illegal.
* Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative. Cover your shoulders and knees and avoid wearing shorts or tight clothing. Take particular care in areas like Jahra and Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh.

You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Kuwait for the latest details. You may be refused entry into Kuwait if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport.
* The local currency is the Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD). ATMs and electronic payment facilities are widely used. Some banks and shops don’t accept foreign cards.
