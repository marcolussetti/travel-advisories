#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can’t help you.

#### Visas

You'll need a visa to enter Kuwait.

Visas on arrival and e-visas are available for Australian citizens. To obtain a tourist visa on arrival, you must:

* pay the fee when you arrive at Kuwait International Airport
* have a return ticket
* provide the address of your accommodation in Kuwait
* have a passport valid for at least 6 months
* not have any security restrictions that prevent entry into Kuwait

You can apply for an e-visa at the Ministry of Interior’s Kuwait Visa website.

To apply for employment or residency visas, contact your nearest [Embassy of Kuwait](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/107).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your nearest Embassy of Kuwait for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

If you overstay your visa, you'll face a large fine or travel ban. Check the expiry date on your visa.

You may be refused entry into Kuwait if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport.

Kuwaiti authorities won’t issue visas in an Australian emergency passport. You can only use an emergency passport to exit Kuwait.

#### Other formalities

Authorities may prevent you from departing Kuwait if:

* you have unpaid debts or fines, including traffic or parking fines, utility or telecommunications bills
* you're in a financial dispute
* you're charged with a criminal offence or are under investigation

Authorities enforce travel bans. They can take months to resolve. Seek the advice of a local lawyer.

If you're applying for an employment or residency visa, you'll need to get supporting documents verified before you arrive. See [Local laws](#local-laws)

Customs officials use strict screening procedures to detect illegal imports. See [Local laws](#local-laws)

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD).

Declare all local and foreign currency equivalent to or over KWD3000 when you arrive. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

ATMs are widely available. Credit cards are widely accepted.

Some banks and shops won't accept foreign cards. Ask your bank if your cards will work in Kuwait.

Change currency only at commercial banks and official exchange bureaux.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Driving in Kuwait is dangerous. Road conditions vary.

Driving speeds are very high in Kuwait compared to Australia. Most drivers pay little attention to other road users. Drivers generally ignore road safety rules.

It's illegal to leave the scene of an accident before police arrive. If you have an accident:

* stay with the vehicle and don't move it
* call the police on 112

If you don't pay traffic or parking fines on time, authorities may:

* seize your vehicle
* impose a travel ban that prevents you from leaving Kuwait

Pay any traffic or parking fines as soon as possible. Residents of Kuwait can check for and pay traffic fines via the Sahel application or Ministry of Interior [website](https://www.moi.gov.kw/main/eservices/gdt/violation-enquiry).

If you must drive in Kuwait:

* check you have adequate insurance
* find out about local traffic laws and practices

#### Driving permit

Kuwait has strict requirements for driver's licences.

If you drive without a valid licence, you could be jailed or deported.

If you're a visitor, you can use a valid International Driving Permit (IDP). 

Get your IDP before leaving Australia.

If you're a resident in Kuwait, you'll need to obtain a [Kuwaiti driver's licence](https://e.gov.kw/sites/kgoenglish/Pages/Services/MOI/PrivateLicense.aspx).

If you plan to drive, get advice from an [embassy or consulate-general of Kuwait](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/107).

#### Taxis

Only use official taxis and limousines. Book transport from a reliable company. Rideshare apps are common.

Some taxis don't use meters, which can result in disputes over the fare. Some taxis only accept cash.

Agree on the fare and form of payment before setting off.

#### Public transport

Public transport exists in Kuwait but is limited to residential areas rather than tourist destinations.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Kuwait's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9K) with the Aviation Safety Network.

#### Sea travel

Many sea areas in the Gulf region are under territorial dispute.

There are reports of vessel inspections, detentions and personnel arrests.

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) happens in the Gulf. Read the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy reports](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).

#### Border crossings

It's illegal and dangerous to travel near the borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia without authorisation.

Armed guards patrol border areas.

All travel to Iraq is dangerous. Don't go there.

If you travel to Iraq despite our advice, ensure you have the correct documents authorising your movements.

Only use authorised road border crossing points into Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

#### Unexploded weapons

Kuwait has unexploded remnants of war, including landmines, in desert areas and on some beaches.

People have been injured after picking up strange metal or plastic objects.

Don't stray from well-travelled roads.
