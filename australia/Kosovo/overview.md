## Overview

### Safety

* Two authorities work to maintain security: the Kosovo Police Force and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), led by NATO.
* Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Kosovo.
* Locals discharge firearms on holidays and other occasions. Be careful of celebratory gunfire, especially during major holidays and sporting victories.

### Health

* Air pollution is a problem, particularly in winter. If you have breathing difficulties, get medical advice before you travel.
* Outbreaks of hepatitis A, trichinellosis, brucellosis and rabies can occur. Drink bottled water. Avoid raw and undercooked food.
* Medical facilities are generally of a lower standard than in Australia. You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### Travel

* Tourists don't need a visa for stays of less than 90 days. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Kosovo for the latest details.
* Security along the Kosovo-Serbia border is unpredictable. Serbia doesn't recognise entry points directly from Kosovo. Don't try to enter Serbia from Kosovo unless you initially travelled to Kosovo from Serbia.
