#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

As a tourist, you won't need a visa for stays of less than 90 days.

You may need to provide documents showing the reason for your visit when entering.

Border authorities issue a 90-day entry stamp. You can renew your stamp for longer stays.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules, contact:

* [Kosovo Foreign Ministry (Albanian)](http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,1)
* [Embassy or consulate of Kosovo](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/106)

#### Kosovo-Serbia border

Tensions between Kosovo and Serbia can cause difficulties at border crossings with Serbia.

Serbia does not recognise border crossings with Kosovo as legal international entry border crossings.

You need a valid, recent Serbian entry stamp in your passport to travel from Kosovo to Serbia. If not, you'll need to transit via a third country.

Don't attempt to enter Serbia from Kosovo unless you initially travelled to Kosovo from Serbia.

For additional information on border crossing waiting times, visit the [Ministry of Internal Affairs.](https://mpb.rks-gov.net/)

#### Passport

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Kosovo is the euro.

You need to declare amounts over 10,000 euro or equivalent when you arrive. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. If you don't, you may be fined.

Although credit card use is increasing, Kosovo is a cash economy based on the euro. ATMs are readily available throughout Kosovo, and users should take normal precautions to safeguard their PIN when using them.

It's a good idea to carry some cash, including for minor purchases.

#### Local travel

Landmines and unexploded weapons

Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are present in Kosovo. The main areas of risk include:

* mountainous regions in the west between Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro and east near Serbia's Presevo Valley
* regions bordering North Macedonia and Albania
* the Dulje Pass area (central Kosovo)

To protect yourself in these areas:

* keep to the main roads
* look out for hazardous areas marked by red 'MINES' signs
* ask locals about ways to stay safe
* don't travel off-road
* don't hike in woodland areas

#### Driving permit

To drive in Kosovo, you need to carry your valid Australian licence. Digital driver's licences may not be accepted

Getting an International Driver's Permit (IDP) is recommended. Get your IDP before leaving Australia.

If you break traffic laws, authorities may take your driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* traffic congestion
* poor local driving skills
* pedestrians and farm animals in rural areas
* regular flooding and heavy snowfalls
* landslides, particularly on the main route between Prishtina and Skopje in North Macedonia

Roadworks are common, and traffic conditions change frequently.

Flooding and heavy snowfalls can severely disrupt road travel.

#### Road rules

You must have third-party vehicle insurance to drive. You can buy insurance when you enter.

You must pay any road tolls and fines in cash in the local currency.

Speed limits are strictly enforced.

If you hire a car, the hire company may not let you cross the border to and from Kosovo.

To reduce your risks when travelling by road:

* check your travel insurance will cover you before driving
* understand local road rules
* avoid travelling at night
* always carry identification and vehicle registration papers

#### Motorcycles

Check whether your travel insurance policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only authorised taxi and limousine services. These services are generally inexpensive, safe, and reliable.  Arrange these through your hotel.

Unofficial taxis may overcharge.

#### Public transport

Buses connecting Prishtina with other major cities are frequent.

Standards aren't the same as Australian buses, and they can often become overcrowded.

**More information:**

* [Transport and getting around safely](/before-you-go/getting-around "Getting around")

#### Rail travel

Rail transportation is very limited and unreliable, and safety equipment is often lacking or outdated.

Trains operate services:

* from Skopje to Prishtina via Hani i Elezit
* from Prishtina to Peja/Pec

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Kosovo's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=Z6) with the Aviation Safety Network.
