#### Police forces in Kosovo

The Kosovo Police Force works with the Kosovo Force (KFOR) to maintain security. KFOR is an international peacekeeping force led by NATO.

Check local developments before and during your journey.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Anti-government protests happen frequently and can turn violent.

Protests can occur in any region. They mostly happen in Prishtina and Mitrovica.

Demonstrations can begin without warning or notice.

To protect yourself, avoid the following:

* public gatherings
* political rallies
* protests
* roadblocks
* demonstrations

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Tensions and conflict

Tensions and ethnic conflict between the Serbian and Albanian populations can occur, particularly in the north.

Towns in northern Kosovo, including North Mitrovica, Leposavić, Zubin Potok and Zvečan, have experienced sudden violent, armed, inter-ethnic conflict.

Reconsider your need to travel to these areas due to the high risk of violence and security incidents.

Violence can happen along Kosovo's southern border with North Macedonia.

Unofficial roadblocks can be set up at short notice.

If you travel to these areas despite the risks, hire a local guide, especially if you travel alone.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* make alternative plans in case the security situation deteriorates
* check that your travel documents are valid for longer than you expect to travel

#### Public events

The discharge of firearms into the air and the release of fireworks could occur during the following:

* holidays
* sporting events
* major elections
* other occasions

This can result in accidental injury.

Be careful of celebratory gunfire, especially around major holidays, celebrations and after sporting victories.

#### Crime

Petty crime can occur, including:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching

This mainly happens in crowded places, such as:

* airports
* on public transport

Carjacking and car theft can also happen.

Assassinations and murders are often linked to organised crime. Violent criminal acts aren't usually directed at travellers.

Privately owned illegal small firearms are common.

To protect yourself from crime:

* take care of your belongings, particularly in crowds
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in other ways that make them harder to snatch
* always lock your car doors
* check local media for news on crime
* avoid trouble spots
* use ATMs inside banks, shops and shopping centres

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Several bomb threats have previously been made in Kosovo, including against transport hubs. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.

Terrorists are likely to try out attacks in Kosovo and may attack with little or no warning.

Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs
* areas that attract large groups of people.

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Bush and forest fires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) can happen from June to September, especially in northern Kosovo.

Heavy rains can cause flooding, especially in spring and summer. Flooding may affect road travel, and landslides are a risk, particularly in mountainous areas.

Extreme hot and dry periods may lead to water shortages.

Large [earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) are rare, but earth tremors are common.

To protect yourself if there's a [natural disaster](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) or [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident):

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact with family and friends
* monitor the media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Other safety considerations

#### Power outages

Power outages can occur throughout Kosovo, disrupting public utilities, including water service, and interfering with traffic lights, normal business activity, and public services.

#### Stray Dogs

Stray dogs are common throughout the country. Don't approach or feed them, as they can be aggressive.
