#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian tourists can enter Mongolia for stays of up to 30 days without a visa.

Foreign nationals may apply for short-term (up to 90 days) diplomatic, official, or business visas on the condition they meet health-related entry requirements.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/133) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Chinggis Khan International Airport is recommended for entry to and exit from Mongolia.

You need to carry proof of your onward or return ticket to enter Mongolia.

Restrictions apply to travel by foreign nationals to some border areas. If you plan to travel in these areas, you must get permission from local authorities.

#### Departure from Mongolia

Monitor the [Australian Embassy website](https://mongolia.embassy.gov.au/) and [social media](https://www.facebook.com/AustraliaInMongolia/) for major updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Other formalities

You must show proof of a return airfare or onward travel to enter Mongolia.

If you're staying longer than 30 days, you must register with the [Office of Immigration in Ulaanbaatar](https://immigration.gov.mn/en/) within 7 days of arriving.

This includes people on working visas. Confirm your employer has registered on your behalf.

If you don't register, authorities can fine you.

If you have a working visa, you must de-register before leaving Mongolia.

You may need an HIV/AIDS test if you:

* plan to work, either paid or voluntary
* [marry](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") a Mongolian national

#### Travel with children

If you're travelling with a child who isn't yours, you must show a notarised letter. The letter must be from the child's legal guardian granting you permission to travel with the child.

**More information:**

* [Advice for people travelling with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children")

#### Import rules

Authorities have strict rules about importing:

* firearms and ammunition
* electrical equipment
* some technological equipment

The [Mongolian Border Protection Authority (Mongolian)](http://www.bpo.gov.mn/en/) will check the equipment. It will work out if tax applies.

These rules also cover items being donated, such as medical equipment.

They don't apply to common personal items, such as laptops and tablets.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is Mongolian Tugrik (MNT).

Some banks in Ulaanbaatar buy Australian dollars. Check the banks' websites before you travel.

You can generally exchange:

* US dollars
* Euros
* Russian roubles
* Chinese yuan

However, these currencies may not be accepted everywhere.

Bank notes of different amounts are exchanged at different rates. Lower value notes receive a lower rate.

Outside Ulaanbaatar, carry cash.

There are few ATMs outside Ulaanbaatar.

Some smaller shops, supermarkets and restaurants don't accept credit cards.

#### Travel between Mongolia and Russia

If, despite our advice, you travel to Russia, you may experience border and customs difficulties when entering by train from Russia.

Declare all goods and cash when entering and leaving Russia.

The [Embassy of Russia in Mongolia](https://mongolia.mid.ru/en_GB/)can issue tourist visas for Russia.

#### Travel between Mongolia and China

If you travel between Mongolia and China, you must follow China's entry and exit rules. This is the case even if you are only transiting through China.

China has included Australia in its visa waiver program from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 2025.

If you hold an ordinary Australian passport, you can enter China without a visa for no more than 15 days for business, tourism, visiting family and friends or transit. Different rules apply for official and diplomatic passport holders.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can't drive a vehicle or ride a motorbike with an Australian driver's licence or International Driving Permit (IDP) in Mongolia.

For short visits, use taxis or hire a car with a driver.

If you plan to stay more than 12 months, apply for a Mongolian licence.

**More information:**

* [National Police Agency](https://police.gov.mn/home?locale=en)

#### Travel by car

To travel to Mongolia by car, you must get approval from the [Mongolian Customs Office](https://www.customs.gov.mn/) before you enter.

For this, you'll need to provide:

* copy of bio data page of passport;
* copy of driver’s licence
* car registration papers;
* ownership certificate;
* travel route and Mongolian contact numbers.

The Mongolian Customs Office will make a record on the foreign citizen’s visa stamp that the citizen has entered with a car, which will be checked when the citizen leaves the country.

Mongolian Border Protection checks the visa in addition to asking for car related documents and requires advance notice if a large number of foreign citizens enter the country by car at the same time.

#### Road travel

Driving in Mongolia can be dangerous, especially at night, due to poor:

* visibility
* road conditions
* vehicle maintenance
* local driving practices

There are few sealed roads outside of Ulaanbaatar.

You're more likely to die in a traffic accident in Mongolia than in Australia.

Many accidents happen during winter due to black ice, especially in urban areas. Right-hand drive vehicles cause many accidents on rural roads. Pedestrians are often injured.

Take care as a pedestrian. Drivers don't always give way, even at marked pedestrian crossings.

To protect yourself when driving beyond city limits:

* take maps
* a GPS or compass
* have back-up communications equipment, such as a satellite phone
* pack emergency medical supplies
* research your route, and ask local drivers or authorities about the road conditions ahead
* check weather forecasts as weather conditions can change quickly

Communication and medical facilities are often poor outside cities.

#### Snowfall

For most of the year, heavy snowfall can:

* restrict access to many regional areas
* greatly increase risks of car travel between towns

To drive safely while travelling during snowy periods:

* allow for additional travel time
* make sure your insurance policy covers delays and cancellations

Severe weather and snowfall can also restrict medical evacuations from remote places.

Take care as a pedestrian during severe weather. Heavy snow can cause black ice on footpaths and road crossings.

If you ride a motorcycle, always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis can be dangerous. Book a reliable, licensed taxi company through your accommodation, restaurant, or venue.

#### Public transport

Local transport providers may not carry accident liability insurance. This includes bus and private car operators.

Always use seatbelts, even if others don't.

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
