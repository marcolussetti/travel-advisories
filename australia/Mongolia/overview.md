## Overview

### Safety

* Pickpocketing and bag snatching is common, especially on public transport and in crowded areas. Criminals posing as police have robbed travellers in the Sukhbaatar Square area of Ulaanbaatar. Be alert to thieves, especially on public transport.
* While uncommon, violent crime is present in Mongolia, particularly in Ulaanbaatar. Criminals have assaulted and sexually harassed foreigners, including during the day and in busy areas. Crime is more common during major festivals and the summer tourist season. Be aware of your surroundings.
* Protests can turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Mongolia's weather is extreme. Temperatures vary from 35°C in summer to minus 40°C in winter. Winter lasts from October to March. Snowstorms can also happen outside winter months. Make sure you have adequate clothing and footwear year-round. Weather conditions can change quickly. Earthquakes, flooding and fires sometimes occur. Follow the advice of local officials.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* The standard of medical care is poor, particularly outside Ulaanbaatar. Bring basic medical supplies with you. You'll have to pay up-front, even in an emergency. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
* Rabies is a risk. It's fatal without immediate treatment. Avoid dogs and other mammals. Seek medical help straight away if an animal bites or scratches you.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), hepatitis and measles. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* During winter, the air in Ulaanbaatar is very polluted. If you have breathing problems, speak to your doctor before you travel.
