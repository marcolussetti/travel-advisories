# Safety

#### Crime

Crimes against travellers are most common during the:

* Tsagaan Sar Festival in January or February
* Naadam Festival in July
* Summer tourist season

#### Violent crime

While uncommon, violent crime occurs in Mongolia, particularly in Ulaanbaatar.

Criminals have randomly assaulted foreigners, even during the day and in busy areas.

Criminal attacks have included:

* physical assaults on foreign men in the company of local women
* harassment and sexual assault of foreign women

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing and bag snatching are also common.

Be alert to thieves on public transport and in crowded areas in Ulaanbaatar, such as:

* Chinggis Khaan International Airport
* the Gandan Monastery
* the State Department Store
* the Naran Tuul Covered Market ('Black Market')
* the Central Post Office
* the Ulaanbaatar Railway Station
* when crossing a road in a pedestrian crowd

Travellers on trains between Mongolia and Russia are also a common target for thieves.

Pay close attention to your belongings, particularly in crowded areas and on public transport.

Criminals have targeted travellers using taxis to rob and harass them.

Only use licensed taxis, preferably booked through your accommodation.

#### Scams

Criminals posing as police officers have [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")travellers. This has happened in the Sukhbaatar Square area of Ulaanbaatar. Mongolian police officers are required to have name tags on their uniforms and carry ID. It is appropriate to ask to see their ID.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Mongolia experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), such as:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* snowstorms
* dust storms

#### Severe weather

Temperatures vary from 35°C in summer to minus 40°C in winter.

Winter is long and severe. It lasts from October to March.

Many accidents happen during winter due to black ice, especially in urban areas. Pedestrians are involved in these accidents too.

Snowstorms can happen outside winter months. Make sure you have adequate clothing and footwear at all times of year.

Weather conditions can change quickly, even in summer. This increases your risk of hypothermia.

The rainy season occurs between July and September. Flooding may happen. Avoid flood areas, monitor local media reports and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Dust storms during May and June can affect visibility when driving.

#### Earthquakes and natural disasters

Mongolia experiences earthquakes.

Forest or grass fires can be a risk in the drier months.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media for the latest information
