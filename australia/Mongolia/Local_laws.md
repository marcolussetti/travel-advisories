# Local laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison terms in local jails.

#### Other laws

By law, you must always carry your passport when travelling in Mongolia.

If you live in Mongolia, you must also carry your residency card.

If you're involved in legal action, authorities might not let you leave. You may have to wait until the issue is resolved. This includes when criminal investigations have started after commercial disputes.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Mongolia doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

If you're a dual national who plans to live in Mongolia, you may need to complete national service. Contact the nearest [Mongolian Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/133) before travelling.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships are legal.

However, the Mongolian National Human Rights Commission has reported LGBTQIA+ travellers can face violence and discrimination.

Members of the LGBTQIA+ community have also reported harassment.

Avoid public displays of affection.
