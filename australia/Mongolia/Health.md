#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mongolia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

The range of medicine available in Mongolia is limited.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Authorities could refuse you entry or prosecute you if you arrive without a prescription for your medication.

#### Health risks

The standard of medical care is poor, particularly outside Ulaanbaatar. If you're in Mongolia, monitor your health closely.

#### Rabies

* seek urgent medical treatment.

#### Air pollution

During winter, from October to March, people burn coal and rubber for heating. The air in Ulaanbaatar can be very polluted.

Speak to your doctor before travelling if you have breathing-related problems.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical care is poor, particularly outside Ulaanbaatar.

Bring basic medical supplies with you.

Doctors and hospitals require payment before treating you, even if it's an emergency.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to get proper care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. You'll probably need to pay up-front. Delays are common while waiting for approvals.

Severe weather and snowfall can delay or stop medical evacuations from remote places.
