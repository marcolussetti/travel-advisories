[Exercise a high degree of caution](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained#level2) in Cyprus due to the active UN peacekeeping operation in the country.

## Overview

### Safety

* A UN peacekeeping force maintains a buffer zone between northern and southern Cyprus. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus controls the southern part of the island. The self-proclaimed 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' ('TRNC') controls the northern part of the island.
* Australia doesn't recognise the Turkish Cypriot administration in the north of Cyprus (the area not effectively controlled by the Government of Cyprus). Our ability to provide consular assistance in the northern part of Cyprus is limited.
* Violence and conflicts can occur in the UN-protected Buffer Zone, especially during public demonstrations. Avoid visiting those locations after such events, when tensions can remain high. Avoid protests.
* Watch out for bag snatching and pickpocketing, particularly in tourist areas.
* Cyprus experiences earth tremors and violent storms. Forest fires are common from May to October. Monitor local media for updates.

### Health

* Heatwaves are becoming more frequent over the summer months. Drink plenty of water, wear light clothing, stay in air conditioning or shaded areas, and follow the advice of local authorities.
* If you plan to visit the northern part of Cyprus, ensure your insurance covers travel to all parts of the country.
* Avoid contact with feral cats, rodents, bats, other vermin and 'yellow fever mosquitoes'. They carry disease. Cases of West Nile Virus have been reported in Cyprus.
* Medical facilities in the Republic of Cyprus's main cities are adequate but expensive. Medical services in the north are basic.

### Local laws

* Cypriot authorities don't always advise Australian authorities when they arrest an Australian citizen. If you're arrested, let the [Australian High Commission](https://cyprus.highcommission.gov.au/) know straight away.
* You could be a national of Cyprus if you have a family connection to Cyprus. You may have to do military service if you have a family connection to Cyprus. Check with the [Ministry of Defence](https://www.gov.cy/mod/en/contact/) (Republic of Cyprus). If you have a Turkish Cypriot background, check with the [relevant authorities](https://mucahit.gov.ct.tr/Asal/Sayfa?Q=14) before you travel.

### Travel

* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest high commission, embassy or consulate of Cyprus for the latest details.
* Expect long queues at Larnaca and Paphos airports during the busy summer months of July and August. Follow your airline's recommendations for arrival times at the airport.
* If you're crossing into and returning from the north of Cyprus (the area not controlled by the government of Cyprus), avoid the Pergamos and Strovilia crossing points. Non-EU citizens are barred from travelling through those crossing points as they're part of the United Kingdom's Sovereign Territory. There's no signage announcing this restriction, and you'll be turned away.
