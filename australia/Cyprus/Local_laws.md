# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Cypriot authorities don't always tell the Australian High Commission they have arrested an Australian citizen. This is especially the case if you're a dual national.

If police arrest or detain you, ask them or your family and friends to notify the Australian High Commission immediately.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can lead to life in jail. Carrying even small amounts of an illegal drug can result in jail time.

#### Buying property

Buying property in the north of Cyprus can be risky. Legal titles to land can be uncertain.  
When the conflict of 1974 displaced people in the north, many had property ownership claims.

It's a crime to buy, sell or rent property without the owner's consent.

Get legal advice before signing a property contract.

It's also a crime to intend to purchase disputed property. Officials may consider your possession of property pamphlets from the north as evidence of intent to purchase.

You could face criminal proceedings if you cross the UN Buffer Zone with documents about buying property in northern Cyprus.

#### Drones

There are laws relating to the use of drones in Cyprus relating to what type of drone can be flown without a licence and where and when they can be flown.

**More information:**

* [Regulations for Drones](https://drones.gov.cy/regulations/) (Cyprus Department of Civil Aviation)

#### Other laws

It's illegal in both parts of Cyprus to:

* take photos of military camps, facilities, personnel or equipment, even by accident
* take photos in the UN Buffer Zone
* take photos in any military-designated area
* enter a restricted military zone
* export cultural or archaeological artefacts without official authorisation

#### Marriage laws

If you plan to [get married](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") in Cyprus, check the legal requirements before travelling.

**More information:**

* [High Commission of the Republic of Cyprus in Canberra](http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/highcom/highcomcanberra.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument)
* [Australian High Commission in Cyprus](https://www.cyprus.embassy.gov.au/)

#### Surrogacy

The Australian High Commission can't assist with surrogacy arrangements, provide legal advice, or recommend hospitals or clinics.

Due to possible legal complications, Australians considering surrogacy in Cyprus should confirm the exact location of the clinic, hospital, or treatment facility on the island before proceeding.

#### Surrogacy in the Republic of Cyprus

Surrogacy in the Republic of Cyprus is highly regulated and subject to strict conditions. Be aware that non-compliance with Cypriot laws on surrogacy could lead to criminal penalties. Before proceeding, seek independent legal advice on both Australian and Cypriot laws.

#### Surrogacy in the north (the area not controlled by the Republic of Cyprus)

You should avoid pursuing surrogacy arrangements in northern Cyprus. Intending parents should be aware that there is a high level of risk involved and that there are public concerns about human rights abuses, sexual exploitation, criminal networks, and a lack of adequate legal protections for all parties involved. Additionally, the Australian High Commission's ability to assist Australian citizens in northern Cyprus is limited.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the Republic of Cyprus, and Civil Unions are recognised. However, they may not be as widely accepted as in Australia. Same-sex sexual activity is also legal in the north of Cyprus but not widely accepted.

#### Dual citizenship

Under local laws, you could be a national of Cyprus if you have a family connection to Cyprus.

The Australian High Commission can't intervene with Cypriot authorities on behalf of those considered to be dual Australian-Cypriot nationals. If you might be eligible for any obligations or duties that apply to dual nationals, such as national military service, contact the Cypriot authorities or a lawyer before you travel.

#### National military service in the Republic of Cyprus

Dual Australian-Cypriot nationals may have to do national military service. This may apply if you're:

If you're a male dual national aged 16 to 26 years, you need an exit permit to leave Cyprus. You can get a permit from either the:

If you're in northern Cyprus, you might have to do military service if you:

#### Length of national military service

Officials may reduce the length of your national service if you show evidence of long-term residency in Australia.

Get a copy of your movements in and out of Australia as evidence of residency. Make a ['Request for International Movement Records](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/request-international-movement-records)' to the [Department of Home Affairs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/).
