#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Political Environment

The Government of the Republic of Cyprus is Cyprus's only internationally recognised authority. However, it only controls the southern part of the island.

The self-proclaimed 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) controls northern Cyprus. Türkiye is the only country that recognises the TRNC. There is also a heavy Turkish military presence in the north. Australia doesn't recognise the TRNC.

The United Kingdom retains sovereignty over 2 Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) on the island. Together, the two SBAs cover 3% of Cyprus's land area.

The Republic of Cyprus is a full European Union (EU) member. The entire island is regarded as part of the EU, but Cypriot and EU law is suspended in the areas not controlled by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.

Be aware of the political sensitivity of the division of the island. Monitor local news for updates.

#### UN Buffer Zone

The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) controls the UN Buffer Zone (also known as the Green Line) between southern and northern Cyprus. Travel between the 2 areas of Cyprus is only permitted at formal crossing points through the UN Buffer Zone (See [Local Travel](#travel)).

You should only enter the UN Buffer Zone at designated crossing points. Attempting entry elsewhere isn't permitted. 

It's illegal on either side of the UN Buffer Zone in south and north Cyprus to:

* Photograph military camps, facilities, personnel, or equipment—or anything that might be considered a security interest—even unintentionally.
* Take photos within the UN Buffer Zone.
* Capture images in any designated military area.

Adhere to 'no photography' signs. Police in all areas strictly enforce these rules.

#### Violent incidents

Some violent incidents have occurred along the UN Buffer Zone. Rowdy, politically motivated behaviour has occurred among fans at local sporting matches.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent, particularly around the UN Buffer Zone.

Frequent violence also occurs at sporting events.

To stay safe:

* take care if speaking about the division of Cyprus in public
* avoid protests and demonstrations
* monitor the media and other sources for possible unrest
* avoid affected areas
* don't take photos in military areas (see [Local laws](#local-laws))
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Bag-snatching, pickpocketing and petty theft happen, particularly in urban and tourist areas including beaches.

To reduce your risk of petty crime:

* look after your belongings, particularly in crowded areas
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you

#### Violent crime

Serious violence, including physical [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), occurs. Media reports have linked the violence to organised crime. Be aware of your surroundings and take normal precautions.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking is a risk, especially in tourist areas. It puts you at a higher risk of theft and [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"). Take reasonable steps to protect yourself.

To reduce your risk of drink spiking:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* don't leave food or drinks unattended

#### Theft around ATMs

Be careful when you use ATMs. If possible:

* use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres
* avoid ATMs that open onto the street, especially at night

#### Scams

To protect yourself from [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers"): 

* check prices before ordering food and drinks, especially at bars and cabarets
* check that the taxi-meter is on when travelling in a taxi
* be aware of counterfeit products
* check the [Cyprus police website](https://www.police.gov.cy/police/police.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument) for the latest on common scams

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Cyprus, they can still happen.

Terrorism occurs in Europe. Terrorist attacks have taken place in several European cities.

Targets have included public transport and transport hubs, and public places frequented by foreigners.

European security services have disrupted a number of planned attacks in recent years.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* be careful around places terrorists tend to target
* monitor local media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

Report suspicious activity or items to the police.

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case there are secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Swimming safety

Strong seas and rips at some beaches pose a risk to swimmers. To stay safe:

* follow warning signs on beaches
* only swim at approved beaches

#### Adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards, including for:

* adventure activities
* water sports and diving
* renting vehicles, such as quad bikes or dune buggies

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* use licensed and insured operators
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets, seat-belts and helmets

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Some operators may ask for your passport as a deposit or guarantee for equipment hire including vehicle rental. [Passports](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services") are valuable documents. Never give your passport as a deposit or guarantee as these may be retained preventing travel.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Cyprus experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* violent wind storms
* [forest fires](/node/346)

To protect yourself if there's a natural disaster or severe weather:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in touch with friends and family
* monitor the media, other local sources and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes

Cyprus experiences earthquakes. While large earthquakes are rare, minor earth tremors can happen.

#### Violent storms

Cyprus can experience violent storms and high winds in coastal regions.

Winter snowstorms occur in the Troodos Mountains. These storms can block roads or create poor driving conditions.

#### Forest fires

Cyprus has forest and grass fires during the long dry season from May until October. Fires are most common in heavily forested and mountainous regions and can start with little warning and travel quickly.
