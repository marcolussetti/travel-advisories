#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away
* that it covers travel to both northern and southern parts of Cyprus

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Cyprus. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Disease

Feral cats, rodents, bats, general vermin and 'yellow fever mosquitoes' can carry diseases that people can catch. Avoid contact with such animals, especially in the countryside or at archaeological sites.

Outbreaks of water-borne, food-borne, insect-borne and other infectious diseases are common in the eastern Mediterranean region and can occasionally occur in Cyprus.

There have been reports of West Nile Virus cases in south and north Cyprus. There's no vaccine to prevent it.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Extreme Heat

Heatwaves are becoming more frequent over the summer months. They can cause heat stroke and exhaustion. Drink plenty of water, wear a hat, wear suitable light clothing, and, if possible, stay indoors during the hottest part of the day. There's limited shade in and around tourist areas.

#### Air Pollution

Air quality in Cyprus is variable due to frequent winds carrying dust from North Africa and the Middle East and the use of dirty fuel in electricity production. The air quality further deteriorates during periods of forest fire. If you typically rely on medication to assist with breathing, bring it with you, and ensure you have enough for your visit.

Follow local media and authorities for up-to-date information on health risks.

#### Medical care

Public and private facilities in the Republic of Cyprus's main cities are adequate but can be costly.

Medical services in northern Cyprus are more basic than in the south.

Cyprus has public and private decompression chambers. Check the [Cyprus Dive Center Association](https://cyprusdiving.org.cy/) for details.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
