#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You don't need a tourist visa to visit Cyprus for stays of up to 90 days in a 6-month period.

If you plan to stay longer, you must apply for a visa. Applications can be made in-country.

If you overstay your visa, officials may charge you with breaching immigration rules.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate for the latest details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Sea Travel

Arrivals by sea must meet the same requirements as air arrivals (see above).

#### Entry to Cyprus

The only legal entry to Cyprus is through:

* the airports of Larnaca and Paphos
* the seaports of Larnaca, Limassol, Latsi and Paphos

It's illegal to enter or exit Cyprus via any air or seaport in north Cyprus (the area not under the Republic of Cyprus's control). 

Illegal entry ports include:

* Tymbou ('Ercan') and Lefkoniko ('Gecitkale') airports
* the seaports of Kyrenia (Girne) and Famagusta (Gazi Magusa)

If you arrive in Cyprus from the north illegally, you could be barred from crossing into the south through the UN Buffer Zone's official checkpoints.

#### Travelling through crossing checkpoints

Travel is permitted between the south and north of Cyprus for Australians arriving through the legal ports of entry in the south. Travel between the 2 areas is only permitted at formal crossing points in the UN Buffer Zone (see Local Travel).

Limitations exist on the goods that can be transported between the south and the north. Live animals, including house pets, aren't allowed to be transported between the south and the north.

Immigration officials might refuse entry into Cyprus if they have concerns about previous or planned travel to the north. This includes accommodation in the north or planned activities, such as commercial, academic or employment activities.

#### Departure from Cyprus

During the summer months of July and August, you should anticipate long security queues at Larnaca and Paphos airports. Follow the advice from your travel provider.

Departure from Cyprus through an illegal exit port in the north won't be recognised as a legal exit, and you could be considered an overstayer of the tourist visa if you've departed from the north.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Currency in the Republic of Cyprus

The Republic of Cyprus, in the south, uses the euro as its official currency. Turkish lira isn't accepted.

#### Currency in the north

The principal currency in the north is the Turkish lira, although many businesses accept euros too.

#### Declaring Currency

Declare any amounts over 10,000 euros (or equivalent) when you're travelling between Cyprus and any non-European Union (EU) country. This covers all forms of currency and gold, not only cash.

No declaration is needed when travelling to or from another EU country.

Failure to declare or incorrect declarations may result in fines upon entering or leaving Cyprus.

#### Payment Options

ATMs are common in tourist areas.

In the South, all businesses must legally accept credit and debit cards. Visa and Mastercard are commonly accepted, while American Express is not widely used.

Cashback is available at some large supermarkets and retail stores.

#### Local travel

#### Travel in the north

Turkish-Cypriot authorities in the north issue residence permits, identity cards and other documents. The Republic of Cyprus and other countries may not recognise these documents.

Use your Australian passport for all travel into or out of Cyprus.

Some countries may refuse entry if your passport or luggage contains evidence you entered Cyprus through any air or seaport in the non-government-controlled north.

If you arrive in Cyprus from the north illegally, you could be barred from crossing into the south through the UN Buffer Zone's official checkpoints.

#### Travelling to or from the north through the UN Buffer Zone crossing points

You can cross into the north if you arrive through legal ports of entry in the south.

You can take private vehicles or hire cars through checkpoints from the south to the north. However, you can't take cars that have been hired in the north through the checkpoints into the south. Cars can't cross at the Ledra Street and Ledra Palace crossings.

You must show your current car insurance when crossing north or south. Ensure your car insurance covers the areas you want to drive through. Car hire companies offer insurance but be aware that their insurance may only cover you in the north or the south. There are usually insurance companies close to the crossing points who can sell you a short-term policy.

#### Travelling to or from the north through the UK’s Sovereign Base Areas

There are 2 crossing points in the United Kingdom's Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia in the east of the island.

* Pergamos (also known as Pyla, Pile, Beyarmudu or Dhekelia)
* Strovilia (also known as Ayios Nikolaos or Akyar)

These crossing points have specific entry and exit rules under international law determining who can use them.

Australians can't cross from north to south at these points, even with a valid Republic of Cyprus visa.

You should avoid these crossings in either direction. Use an alternative crossing point, such as Dherynia (also known as Famagusta or Gazimagusa).

#### Staying in the north

Republic of Cyprus authorities have deemed some hotel and tourist accommodations in the north illegal. These are listed in the memorandum link below. The Republic of Cyprus has warned visitors about staying in this accommodation, and may put you at risk of legal action on the part of the owners.

#### Carrying goods between the north and south

You may need to present your goods for inspection when you cross between the north and south.

Strict controls apply to items bought in the north, including:

* alcohol
* cigarettes
* imitation or pirated brand-name products

Republic of Cyprus police or customs authorities may confiscate these items. They may also fine you.

Customs officials in the north enforce a limit on the purchase of goods in the south.

Both sides enforce quarantine rules on food.

#### Driving permit

You can only use your Australian driver's licence for 6 months from your date of arrival. 

You'll need to obtain a local driving licence to continue to drive after 6 months. To get a local licence, refer to the [Road Transport Department](http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/rtd/rtd.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument).

The minimum age for driving is 18 years.

#### Road travel

Road accidents are a major risk.

Most roads are of a good standard, but some secondary and mountain roads are poorly maintained.

Driving practices can be poor. Drivers often:

* ignore international driving norms
* use mobile phones while driving
* disobey traffic signals
* fail to use indicators
* ignore speed limits

Be careful crossing roads, as traffic may not follow signals.

Be aware of quad bikes on roads. 

The UN and military restrict access to roads in the UN Buffer Zone. Parts of this zone have landmines.

If you plan to drive:

* only hire cars from reputable companies
* make sure you've got the right licence for the vehicle you plan to drive
* check your insurance covers you in the north and the south

#### Motorcycles

Check with your insurer if your policy covers you using a motorbike, quad bike, dune buggy or similar vehicle.

Many serious injuries and deaths from quad-bike accidents happen each year, particularly in tourist areas. Follow directions on where you can and can't ride quad bikes or similar vehicles.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only authorised taxi and limousine services. Arrange them through your hotel, if possible, or through apps such as Bolt.

Unofficial taxis may overcharge.

#### Public transport

Bus and coach services operate throughout Cyprus.

Theft can occur on public transport. Take care of your belongings.
