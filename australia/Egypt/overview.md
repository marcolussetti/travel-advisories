## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* There's a high threat of terrorist attacks and violent crime in the Governorate of North Sinai.
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access which is subject to change at short notice. It has been subject to air strikes during the current conflict.
* Terrorists have attacked popular tourist locations, resulting in deaths and injuries. More attacks are likely. Be alert to possible threats.
* Terrorist groups in Egypt have targeted Christians in the past. Take care, particularly during major religious periods and at religious sites.
* You're at risk of kidnapping in Egypt. Take extra precautions.
* Violent crime can happen. Take extra care if you're a woman and alone. Don't leave valuables unsecured in your hotel room or unattended in a public place.
* Women, particularly foreigners, are frequently subject to unwelcome male attention.

### Health

* Infectious diseases are common. These include hepatitis, filariasis and rabies. Only drink boiled or bottled water. Avoid contact with dogs and cats.
* Don't swim in fresh water, including the Nile River, to avoid waterborne diseases such as bilharzia (schistosomiasis).
* Dengue and malaria are present. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Cairo can have very high levels of pollution and dust. If you suffer from breathing difficulties or a lung condition, seek medical advice before travel.

### Local laws

* Making public comments that criticise the Egyptian government, security forces, or Islam can be illegal. Police have arrested foreign visitors who posted critical social media.
* There are severe consequences for carrying illegal drugs, including the death penalty, long prison sentences or deportation.
* You need approval to bring satellite phones and radio communications equipment into Egypt. Apply to the [Ministry of Communications and Information Technology](http://mcit.gov.eg/) before you leave. The use of drones is illegal.
* Egyptian family law differs significantly from Australian law. Before you become involved in a local legal matter, get legal advice, including on family and business legal matters.
* Although same-sex relationships are not explicitly criminalised in Egypt, the charge of 'debauchery' has been used to prosecute LGBTQIA+ people. There is little public acceptance of homosexuality in Egypt. Avoid any public displays of affection.
* Sex outside of marriage is illegal. Dress standards are very conservative, particularly for women. Wear modest clothes that cover your legs and upper arms.

### Travel

* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Egypt for the latest details.
* Foreign journalists need accreditation from the Egyptian Press Centre before arrival. There are severe punishments for journalists working without accreditation.
* There are landmines in some coastal and desert areas. Get advice from local authorities before you travel and do not travel off marked paths or roads. See [Landmines in Egypt](https://beta.sis.gov.eg/en/media-center/files/landmines-in-egypt/) for further information.
* Australian-Egyptian dual nationals are treated as Egyptian. This will limit your access to consular assistance. Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/our-services/passport-services) if possible. This doesn't mean you will receive special treatment in terms of local law.
