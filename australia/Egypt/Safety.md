#### Terrorism

Although the greatest terrorist threat is in North Sinai, terrorist attacks could occur anywhere in Egypt. Potential targets include:

* religious sites
* tourist locations

The last major attacks occurred in 2019, but more attacks could happen at any time without warning.

To reduce your risks from terrorism:

* consider the level of security at places you plan to visit
* have a clear exit plan in case of a security incident
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe to. Continue to avoid the area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Governorate of North Sinai

There's a high threat of terrorist attacks and violent crime in the Governorate of North Sinai, including the Taba-Suez Road. Do not travel to North Sinai.

Terrorists or criminals could target you, or you might be included in violence directed at others.

North Sinai is under a long-term state of emergency.

The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods and is subject to change at short notice. It has been subject to air strikes during the current conflict.

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to North Sinai:

* seek professional security advice
* arrange contingency plans and personal security measures
* note that our ability to provide consular assistance may be extremely limited

#### Security Situation

Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and the security situation could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. Peaceful protests and rallies can turn violent at short notice. Be aware, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media for updates.

There's a high threat of terrorist attacks and violent crime in the Governorate of North Sinai.

The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods and is subject to change at short notice. It has been subject to air strikes during the current conflict.   

In October 2023, suspected drones and projectiles impacted areas along the Gulf of Aqaba, including in Taba, close to Egypt's border with Israel's Red Sea port of Eilat, and in the Red Sea resort town of Nuweiba, north of Dahab. Be alert to possible strikes. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

Be alert and monitor local media for updates.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests can occur across Egypt.

Clashes between rival protesters or security forces have resulted in many deaths and injuries. Foreigners, including journalists, have been among the victims. Serious [sexual assaults](/node/355) on women, including foreigners, have occurred during demonstrations.

Security forces have targeted foreign journalists. Egyptian authorities have arrested, detained or questioned journalists.

#### Protest hotspots

Protests can happen anywhere and at any time, although strict security clampdowns have been preventing protests in recent years. However, the following places and times are common focal points for demonstrations:

* Tahrir Square and surrounding streets, including the nearby British and US Embassies and Garden City area, in Cairo
* the al-Ittihadiya Presidential Palace in Heliopolis, Giza
* the area of the Raba Al-Adawiya Square in Nasr City
* Fridays following midday prayers
* the anniversary of the 2011 revolution on 25 January and the days leading up to this public holiday

Under Egyptian law, it's illegal for:

* more than 10 people to gather without notice
* foreigners to participate in protests and demonstrations

Authorities may arrest foreigners who participate in protests.

Egyptian authorities may impose curfews and restrictions on movement at short notice.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, rallies and large crowds
* monitor the media for possible unrest and avoid those areas
* obey any curfews and respect local laws
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to change your travel plans

Protests may disrupt transport. Contact your airline or travel agent to check.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is rare but can occur, including [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery), [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault), incidents involving minors, carjacking and burglary.

Petty crime remains low in Cairo, although the declining economy and ensuing financial hardship have seen reports of increased crime.

Take extra care if you're a woman and alone. Women may be physically and verbally harassed or [assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault), including when using public transport and walking in public areas.

Ensure children and young people are always accompanied by known or trusted people and not left alone with hotel or entertainment/excursion staff. If you feel uncomfortable, leave the area and seek help from the hotel or local authorities. The Tourist Police can be contacted on 126 or 122 if you're a resident of Egypt.

Taxi and rideshare drivers have assaulted passengers, including foreigners (See [Travel).](#travel)

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't leave valuables outside a safe in your hotel room or unattended in a public place
* be alert to pickpockets and bag snatchers in tourist areas, particularly after dark
* read [reducing the risk of sexual assault](/node/355) before you go

If you're the victim of a crime, report the incident to the tourist police immediately.

If you don't report a crime before you leave, you may not be able to seek prosecution later.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

Kidnapping is a risk in Egypt. Terrorists have targeted foreign nationals. There is a high threat of terrorist kidnappings in South and North Sinai. Terrorist attacks occur frequently in these areas.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes for:

* hot air balloon flights and boat tours
* water sports, such as scuba diving
* adventure activities, including quad biking and kite surfing

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check tours are well equipped with food, medical supplies and emergency communications
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Safaris and camping

Always use a tour operator when camping, and check with the operator if camping is permitted by local authorities in the areas you plan to camp.

Authorities have banned safaris and camping in the area near Bahariya Oasis until further notice. This includes the western and southern parts of Oases–Siwa and Oases Road. Camping in the White Desert may also be banned.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Egypt, particularly Cairo, experiences [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"). Find out about local safety procedures in case one strikes.

Sand and dust storms occur between March and May.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occurs, follow the advice of local authorities.
