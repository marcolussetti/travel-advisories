# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Criticising authority

Authorities may treat public comments that criticise the Egyptian Government, security forces or Islam as illegal. Police have arrested foreigners who published critical social media posts, including 'liking' pages.

#### Drugs

Possessing illegal drugs can lead to the death penalty, long prison sentences or deportation.

#### Family law

Egyptian family law differs significantly from Australian law, particularly in relation to divorce, child custody and support.

Before you become involved in a local legal matter, get legal advice, including for family and business legal matters.

It's important to know your rights and responsibilities under Egyptian law (see [Travel).](#travel)

#### Marriage laws

If you want to get married in Egypt, check the legal requirements before you travel. You can do this either through the [Australian Embassy in Cairo](http://egypt.embassy.gov.au/caro/home.html) or the [Egyptian Embassy in Canberra](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/61).

#### Other laws

In Egypt, it's illegal to:

* have sexual relations outside marriage
* take photos of bridges and canals, including the Suez Canal
* take photos of military personnel, buildings or equipment

The Egyptian Government doesn't interfere with the practice of Christianity, but preaching is illegal. If you're considering preaching in Egypt, seek local legal advice beforehand. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

LGBTQIA+ individuals face significant social stigma and discrimination in Egypt. Egyptian law does not explicitly criminalise same-sex relationships, however, people have been charged with 'committing an indecent act in public and breaching public morality' and penalised with imprisonment.

LGBTQIA+ people and advocacy groups have reported harassment, intimidation, arrests, and other forms of abuse, including by police.

There are also reports that authorities have used social media, dating websites, and mobile phone apps to entrap people suspected of being gay or transgender in the act of 'debauchery,' which is a criminal offence that carries severe sentences.

There is little public acceptance of homosexuality in Egypt.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

If you're an Australian-Egyptian dual national, local authorities will treat you as an Egyptian, even if you travel on an Australian passport.

This limits our consular services if you're arrested or detained.

If possible, always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/our-services/passport-services).

Dual nationals living in Egypt for long periods need proof of Egyptian citizenship, such as a national identification card.

Male dual nationals who haven't completed military service usually don't need to enlist. However, they must get an exemption certificate before they can leave Egypt. Get one from the nearest [Egyptian embassy, consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/61), or Ministry of Defence Draft Office.

If you're arrested, request local authorities inform the Australian Embassy.

#### Local customs

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Egypt. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public or in front of people who are fasting.

Orthodox Easter is observed by the Christian community, as is Christmas Day, which is celebrated on 7 January in Egypt.

The work week is Sunday to Thursday. Egypt's customs, laws, and regulations follow Islamic practices and beliefs. Exercise common sense and discretion in dress and behaviour.

Dress conservatively. Knee-length or longer dresses and long sleeves are preferable for women, and men should not wear shorts outside tourist areas. Respect religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities. Overt public displays of intimate affection are frowned upon in Egyptian culture.

If in doubt, seek local advice.
