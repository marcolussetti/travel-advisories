#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/61) of Egypt for the latest details. To pay for a tourist visa on entry, you must have a non-Egyptian credit card or US dollars in cash.  Bring the required amount, as ATMs may not disperse USD or other foreign currency.

Check with your travel provider for the latest information and monitor the travel advice of the country you're planning to transit through. There are no direct flights to Australia, but there are flights via a transit hub to Australia.

#### Border with Israel

The land border crossing between Israel and Egypt (Taba Border Crossing – Menachem Begin Crossing) is currently open, but crossings may close without notice and for an unknown period of time. If you're departing Israel to Egypt, check the latest public information from local authorities in both Israel and Egypt to determine if border crossings are open before travel.

To avoid long wait times at the border, you should pay for the Israeli [crossing fee online](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fborderpay.metropolinet.co.il%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C5f8bc89ccb994418981908ddaf28d4e8%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638859312092875343%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Sr9Qfpv3cHiDnFgXDt7Cov7JAKt6NJh0NxXoytp0F5I%3D&reserved=0) before you arrive. You'll need to pay for a tourist visa and a land border entry fee for entry to Egypt. For the visa, you must have a non-Egyptian credit card or US dollars in cash. For the land border entry fee (payable in Egyptian Pounds) an ATM is available in the terminal. Plan for possible delays and make sure you have a supply of food, water and medication.

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning. Be aware that we currently advise Reconsider your Need to travel North of the St Catherine-Nuweiba Road in South Sinai except for the coast.

#### Children

Children of Egyptian fathers must have their father's approval to leave Egypt. Authorities may ask for proof of this approval before allowing the children to leave.

#### Other formalities

#### Journalist accreditation

Foreign journalists must get accreditation from the [Egyptian Press Centre](https://www.sis.gov.eg/Home/ContactUs?lang=en-us) before arrival. You need this if your visit is for work purposes. The Press Centre is part of the Egyptian State Information Service.

Punishments are severe for journalists working without accreditation.

#### Communications equipment and drones

You need approval to bring satellite phones and radio communications equipment into Egypt.

Apply to Egypt's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology well in advance of your trip. Authorities are likely to confiscate equipment brought in without clearance.

The use of drones, for any purpose, is illegal. Authorities will confiscate drones on arrival.

#### Pest control

If you arrive in Egypt by road, officials may check your car for pests. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Egypt if you arrive from a country where yellow fever is widespread.

**More information:**

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Egyptian Pound (EGP).

You can take up to EGP 5000 in cash when travelling to or from Egypt.

You must declare all foreign currency amounts over $US 10,000 or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you're visiting as a tourist, you may need to pay $US or euros for your accommodation. Most well-established hotels and resorts accept card payments. ATMs are available in most established areas.

Consult your financial institution prior to your travel.

#### Local travel

Consider the security situation and risks to your safety in different locations (see [Safety).](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/egypt?#safety)

#### Landmines

There are landmines in some areas, notably:

* the desert areas around El Alamein
* stretches of coastline near Marsa Matruh
* the western shore of the Gulf of Suez
* the Sinai Peninsula

Before you go, tell local authorities of your planned travel. Ask them about current risks and precautions for your route and destination. Do not travel off marked paths or roads.

**More information:**

* [Landmines in Egypt](https://beta.sis.gov.eg/en/media-center/files/landmines-in-egypt/) (Government of Egypt)

#### Travel restrictions and disruptions

If you travel around Egypt, you may be stopped at military and civilian checkpoints. Officials at checkpoints have detained and harassed foreigners.

#### Sinai

Rules apply to people entering the Sinai, including via the Ahmed Hamdi tunnel. When you enter, you must present one of the following:

* a valid form of ID with a Sinai address
* proof of ownership or rental contracts of property in the Sinai
* hard copy evidence of hotel reservations

Travel to the Sinai in a 4WD vehicle may be restricted if you don't hold a valid permit. Check the advice of local authorities before travel.

#### Land borders

Egypt's borders are under military control.

The military restricts and, in some cases, bans the movement of civilians and vehicles.

You need permission to cross borders on the main sealed roads, including at the borders with Libya, Sudan, Israel and parts of the Sinai. Get permission from the Travel Permits Department of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.

#### Gaza Strip

If, despite our advice, you plan to cross from Egypt into the Gaza strip:

* read our advice on [Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/israel-and-palestinian-territories)
* check border crossing requirements with your nearest [Egyptian embassy](https://egyptconsulatesydney.com/en/) or the Ministry of the Interior in Cairo

You must get permission from Egyptian authorities to enter and exit the Gaza Strip using the Rafah border crossing.

If you enter the Gaza Strip through this border, you must leave the same way.

You may be delayed in the Gaza Strip for a long time, possibly weeks while waiting for approval to return.

The Australian Government can't influence the granting of approval or when the crossing will open. Our ability to provide consular help in Gaza is extremely limited.

#### Other borders

Road travel to Abu Simbel, 40km north of the Sudanese border, can be dangerous. If you do, go on an organised tour guarded by police escorts.

There's a high threat of terrorist attacks within 50km of Egypt's border with Libya. Deadly attacks have occurred in the area.

#### Driving permit

You can't drive in Egypt on your Australian driver's licence.

Before arriving in Egypt, get an international driver's permit and get an [embassy or consulate of Egypt](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/61) to certify it.

#### Road travel

Road travel can be dangerous.

Road conditions are very poor. Cars, buses and trucks frequently drive at high speed and without headlights at night.

Road accidents occur often.

Where possible, avoid travelling by road. Visit regional places, including Luxor, by other means.

* [Driving or riding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety)

#### Motorcycles

Take extra care if you plan to ride a motorbike. Be alert to the different road conditions.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis and Rideshare

Cairo and Alexandria have a lot of taxis. Rideshare services are available in Cairo and Alexandria.

In Cairo, taxis are white. In Alexandria, taxis are black and yellow.

All taxis should have a meter. The law requires drivers to use their meters. However, many taxi drivers will claim that the meter is broken and try to negotiate a fare.

Taxis rarely have seatbelts, especially in the back seats.

Sexual harassment of women by taxi drivers is common.

Avoid taxis, especially if you're a woman and on your own. Ride share apps may be safer as you can track your driver's details and share the trip details with others.

If you use a taxi, travel with people you know or advise others of your planned travel and destination.

#### Public transport

The Cairo Metro subway system is generally reliable.

Maintenance and safety standards of other public road and rail transport are very poor.

#### Rail travel

Train travel is generally safe, but accidents do occur.

In March and April 2021, two train accidents occurred in North and South Egypt. The accidents caused many deaths and injuries.

There have been a number of train derailments on the Cairo-Aswan line. Several people were injured when a train derailed between Aswan and Luxor in 2016.

#### Sea travel

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) and [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344) are risks in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

All forms of shipping are attractive targets for pirates. This includes commercial vessels, pleasure craft and luxury cruise liners.

The [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org/) issues piracy reports.

If you plan to [travel by boat](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/359), be highly alert and cautious in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

#### Scuba diving / aquatic activities

Sharks and other potentially dangerous aquatic animals are in Egyptian waters. Certain beaches and dive areas may be subject to temporary closures. Exercise caution and seek advice from local authorities. Ensure you dive with reputable and licensed operators.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Egypt's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=SU) with the Aviation Safety Network.
