## Overview

### Safety

* There's an ongoing risk of terrorist attack in Indonesia. Be alert to possible threats. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities. Popular tourist areas may be the target of terrorist attacks.
* Public protests and events that draw large groups of people occur regularly and can turn violent with little notice. Expect traffic delays and restricted access to locations if there are protests. Avoid protests and demonstrations and monitor local media for the latest updates.
* There's been tension, including demonstrations and violence, in towns within the provinces of Papua, Papua Pegunungan, Papua Tengah and Papua Selatan in recent years. Armed groups have stated that they're targeting foreigners, including Australians. Our ability to provide consular support in these provinces is limited. Armed groups have killed a foreign pilot and shot at aircraft, including commercial planes, in remote airports in the provinces of Papua Pegunungan and Papua Tengah.
* Many of Indonesia's volcanoes are active and can erupt without warning. Adhere to exclusion zones around volcanoes, which can change at short notice, and follow the advice of local authorities. Volcanic activity may escalate without notice, leading to flight disruptions and airport closures, including in surrounding provinces. Contact your airline for the latest flight information. Monitor Indonesia's [Volcano Observatory Notice](https://magma.esdm.go.id/v1/vona?code=KRA) for the latest volcanic activity (Bahasa Indonesia and English), [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) and the [Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre](http://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/volcanic-ash/) for updates.
* Petty and violent crime occurs in Indonesia. Opportunistic crime, such as pickpocketing, occurs. Crimes involving taxis and taxi drivers occur. Solo women are at higher risk. Be always alert in taxis, public transport, crowds, bars and nightclubs.
* Drinks may be spiked or mixed with toxic substances. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave food or drinks unattended. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Legal disputes over real estate are common, including in Bali. Before entering into an agreement or providing financial details, do your research and get legal advice.
* Natural disasters such as severe weather, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis occur regularly. Weather conditions can change quickly during the wet season (usually around October – April; however, the wet season can be different in Eastern Indonesia). Regularly check weather reports, monitor media and speak to your travel provider before continuing with planned activities. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* When undertaking adventure activities, ensure that functioning safety equipment is available, that you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for these activities.
