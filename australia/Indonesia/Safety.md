# Safety

#### Terrorism

The terrorist threat in Indonesia is ongoing. Attacks could happen anywhere and anytime, including in tourist locations.

Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities. Remain respectful of religious and local customs.

Indonesian authorities continue to investigate and disrupt terrorist groups in Indonesia, including Bali.

Terrorist attacks are motivated by extreme beliefs. Both local grievances as well as events in other parts of the world could motivate extremists in Indonesia towards violence.

#### Recent terrorist attacks

In December 2022, an explosion occurred at a police station in Bandung, Jawa Barat, killing 2 and injuring 11.

In March 2021, 2 suicide bombers attacked a church in Makassar, injuring dozens.

In the past, police have said that terrorist suspects remain at large and may seek Western targets.

Indonesian security agencies continue to conduct operations against terrorist groups.

Terrorists in Indonesia may carry out small-scale violent attacks with little or no warning.

Be alert in places of worship, especially during periods of religious significance.

Terrorists have previously targeted places of worship in:

* Makassar
* Surabaya
* Solo
* Poso

As well as places of worship, other possible targets by terrorists include:

* Indonesian government facilities, premises and symbols associated with the Indonesian Government
* police stations and checkpoints
* bars, nightclubs, cafes and restaurants
* hotels
* cinemas and theatres
* shopping centres, public transport and transport hubs
* airports and airlines
* clubs, including sporting clubs
* tourist areas and attractions, tour buses and tour groups
* outdoor recreation events

Supporters have committed additional acts of violence in response to high-profile extremists being detained or killed.

To protect yourself during a terrorist attack:

* leave the area as soon as it's safe
* follow the advice of local authorities
* don't gather in a group after an attack
* don't gather in a group if you're evacuated from a building

Security remains at a high level at:

* the Australian Embassy in Jakarta
* the Consulates-General in Bali, Makassar and Surabaya

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Most events are announced before they happen; however, protests may occur with little or no notice.

Protests and events are often held near major government buildings and embassies in Jakarta, including the Australian Embassy.

Protests may also occur at any of Australia's Consulates-General in Surabaya, Bali and Makassar, at government buildings, or the offices of international organisations in Indonesia.

You can expect traffic delays and restricted access to locations if there are protests.

Phone or email ahead for an appointment before going to the Embassy or the Consulates-General (see [Local contacts](#local-contacts)).

Demonstrations and acts of violence can happen when courts try and sentence extremists.

Conflict between different communities can sometimes occur, including in the provinces of Papua, Papua Pegunungan, Papua Tengah and Papua Selatan. Our ability to provide consular support in these provinces is limited.

Local violence can also be directed at minority groups in other parts of Indonesia, including in Java.

If you're found to endanger security or public order, you may be prosecuted under Indonesia's Immigration laws, which may result in imprisonment or deportation.

To protect yourself from possible violence:

* avoid protests and demonstrations
* monitor local media for the latest security updates
* plan your activities to avoid potential unrest on significant dates
* be prepared to change your travel plans

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/node/343)

#### Armed conflict

The provinces of Papua, Papua Pegunungan, Papua Tengah and Papua Selatan experience regular violent clashes involving armed groups, civilians, Indonesian police, and the military. Armed groups have stated that they are targeting foreigners, including Australians. Our ability to provide consular support in these provinces is limited.

Many people have been killed and injured in clashes. This includes members of security forces, armed groups and civilians. Violent attacks have occurred in several areas of these provinces, including in and around Jayapura. There's a risk of more attacks.

In February 2023, a riot broke out in Wamena, Papua Pegunungan Province, when a crowd attacked Indonesian security personnel following the arrest of two people accused of child kidnapping. 12 civilians and rioters were killed.

Violent attacks have occurred around the Freeport Mine in Papua Tengah Province.

Armed groups have:

* killed a New Zealand helicopter pilot in Mimika, Papua Tengah Province
* taken a New Zealand pilot hostage in Paro, Papua Pegunungan Province
* shot at aircraft, including commercial planes, at Beoga airport in Papua Tengah Province and Nop Goliat Dekai airport in Papua Pegunungan Province
* killed people in attacks, including one Australian
* attacked vehicles using the road between Grasberg and Timika
* killed people in violent attacks in Puncak Jaya District, Papua Tengah Province

More attacks are possible and could target infrastructure and national institutions

#### Crime

A range of crimes, including violent crime, occur in Indonesia. Crimes can happen in popular tourist locations in Bali.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be aware of your surroundings
* be alert in crowds
* understand the potential crime risks

#### Theft

Theft, [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and bag and phone snatching have occurred. These crimes can sometimes involve violence. Opportunistic crime such as pickpocketing occurs.

Be careful of thieves:

* on motorcycles targeting pedestrians
* in upmarket shopping malls
* in crowded public transport
* at traffic lights targeting people in stopped cars
* at bars and nightclubs
* when entering accommodation, including villas in Bali

Keep bags and valuables out of sight in vehicles.

If you're travelling on foot, walk:

* on footpaths
* away from the curb
* with your bag held away from traffic

#### Sexual assault

If you're a victim of [sexual assault](/while-youre-away/crime/sexual-assault-overseas "I've been sexually assaulted overseas"):

* seek immediate medical assistance. If you have any doubts about seeking medical assistance after a sexual assault, contact your nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate in Indonesia (see [Local contacts](#local-contacts)) as quickly as possible.
* make a full statement to local police, where the incident has occured, so they can conduct a criminal investigation. Local police will only investigate a crime that has been reported in person. You may wish to seek consular help before you visit the police station. Contact your nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate (see [Local contacts](#local-contacts)).

Your sworn statement, or statements by witnesses, can be used as evidence in criminal court proceedings. In some cases, you may be asked to return to Indonesia for the case to progress. 

#### Counselling support

Should you wish to speak to a counsellor, you can call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate (see [Local contacts](#local-contacts)). They can connect you to counselling hotlines and services.

#### Bars and nightclubs

Be alert in bars and nightclubs to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Drink-spiking and snatching of valuables may occur if you're not alert. Cases of drink poisoning have been reported in Indonesia, including in Bali and Lombok.

Don't leave food or drinks unattended. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Drinks may be contaminated with drugs or toxic substances. See [Health](#health).

Never accept drinks, food, gum, cigarettes, vapes or e-cigarettes from people you've just met.

**More information:**

* [Partying safely](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely")

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card, online banking and ATM fraud occurs in Indonesia.

Check your bank statements regularly and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for banking, uploading or accessing personal information.

Make sure your bank doesn't block your cards. Before you travel, notify your bank you'll be visiting Indonesia and ensure your phone number and accounts work overseas.

Never let your card out of your sight. This includes when you pay in restaurants.

Shield your PIN from sight.

Some vendors, including at ATMs, install hidden cameras and use card skimmers. Use authorised ATMs and, if in doubt, visit a bank branch with an ATM.

Don’t click on unknown links in WhatsApp or mobile phone text messages, particularly if your phone is linked to mobile banking.

Use authorised ATMs at controlled and secure places, such as:

* banks
* shops
* shopping centres

#### Scams and confidence tricks

Beware of [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and confidence tricks.

Only exchange money at authorised money changers. Authorised money changers can also be found on the [Bali Foreign Exchange website](https://www.authorizedmoneychanger.id/money-changer). Unauthorised money changers have been known to scam foreign tourists in Bali and elsewhere.

All types of gambling are illegal in Indonesia.

Australians have lost large sums of money in card game scams run by organised gambling gangs, particularly in Bali. See [Local laws](#local-laws).

Some tourists have been robbed or planted with drugs after taking new acquaintances back to their hotel rooms. In some cases, their drinks were spiked.

Legal disputes over the purchase of real estate are common, including in Bali, involving:

* land
* houses
* holiday clubs and resorts
* businesses
* timeshare schemes

Before entering into an agreement or providing financial details:

* thoroughly research the proposal
* get legal advice and know your rights, especially before you sign any documents
* ensure your investment or agreement is legal and legally enforceable in Indonesia

#### Using taxis

Only use licensed, official metered taxis or official ride-hailing services that use app-tracking meters and have official contact details. Ensure your driver is using a map when driving.

Crimes involving unregistered taxis include:

* taxis departing before the passenger can take their baggage from the vehicle
* taxi drivers robbing or temporarily holding passengers, including in urban areas
* taxi drivers forcing passengers to withdraw money at ATMs before releasing them
* taxi drivers not using or following the map
* assault committed against passengers

Lone [female travellers](/before-you-go/who-you-are/women "Advice for women travellers") are at higher risk of crime.

If you're in an incident involving a taxi, leave the taxi and the immediate area if it's safe to do so. Report the incident to the taxi provider or local authorities immediately.

To protect yourself from overcharging and scams:

* only travel in licensed taxis with signage, a "taxi" roof sign and working meters
* ensure the driver's identification card is visible
* book via your phone, on an official taxi company mobile app, from inside an airport, or at stands at major hotels
* don't accept just any taxi at arrival terminals in airports or seaports. Check they're an official metered taxi before you get in

See [Travel](#travel).

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to public Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. Cyber security standards may not be the same as they are in Australia.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

**More information:**

* [Cyber security when travelling overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/staying-safe/cyber-security)

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely"). 

Cases of drink poisoning have been reported in Bali and Lombok.

People have been poisoned by alcoholic drinks contaminated with harmful substances, including methanol and arak (a traditional rice-based spirit). Indonesian citizens and foreigners, including Australians, have died or become seriously ill from poisoned drinks. Symptoms of methanol poisoning can be similar to drinking too much. However, they are usually stronger.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the Indonesian police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

Contaminated drinks have included:

* local spirits
* spirit-based drinks, such as cocktails
* brand name alcohol

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping for ransom is a risk in Indonesia. This includes foreign nationals and expatriates working for international companies. The risk of kidnapping is higher in the provinces of Papua (Papua), Papua Highlands (Papua Pegunungan), Central Papua (Papua Tengah) and South Papua (Papua Selatan).

On 5 August 2024, a New Zealand helicopter pilot was killed by an armed group in Alama District, Mimika Regency, Papua Tengah Province. In February 2023, a New Zealand pilot was taken hostage by an armed group in Paro, Papua Pegunungan Province.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

**More information:**

* [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)

#### Adventure activities

Many businesses don't follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes transport and tour operators, water sports providers, hotels, restaurants and shops.

It may affect adventure activities, such as:

* bungee jumping
* skydiving
* parasailing
* paragliding
* rafting
* scuba diving and snorkelling
* surfing
* boat rides
* chairlift or gondola rides

In the past, Australians have been seriously injured or died while participating in adventure activities. If you require intensive care medical treatment, emergency surgery or medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about safety, search and rescue procedures before you accept and pay for an activity
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts
* check with your travel provider on vessel capacity limits before embarking on sea, land or air travel
* check weather and ocean conditions, and whether the vessel has had any mechanical issues, on the day and before continuing with water activities or sea travel
* check where the nearest medical facilities are

If proper safety equipment isn't available or you're unsure of the provider's safety or maintenance procedures, use another provider or don't undertake the activity.

#### Trekking and climbing

Some mountain treks suit only experienced climbers. Travel with a guide and check the level of difficulty beforehand.

Many trekking options may be on or around an active volcano. Many of Indonesia's volcanoes are active and can erupt without warning. Volcanic and seismic activity may continue for some time. Adhere to exclusion zones around volcanoes, which can change at short notice, and follow the advice of local authorities. If you're planning to travel to an area near an active volcano, check with local authorities before climbing and visit:

* Bureau of Meteorology [Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre](http://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/volcanic-ash/)
* [MAGMA Indonesia](https://magma.esdm.go.id/v1/vona?code=LOK) (Bahasa Indonesia) for daily updates on status and alert levels
* [National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB)](https://www.bnpb.go.id/) (Bahasa Indonesia)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)

#### Swimming safety

Australians have drowned in coastal areas, due to rough seas and strong rip currents in including at popular beaches in Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands, Labuan Bajo and Raja Ampat.

Swimming conditions can vary and change rapidly. Before you dive into the water be informed:

* Rip currents in Indonesian waters can be dangerous. They are responsible for several drownings of Australian tourists each year.
* Most beaches do not have lifeguards or warnings about unsafe conditions.
* Local beach rescue services may not be of the same standard as in Australia.
* There have been instances of boats colliding with people swimming, snorkelling or scuba diving.
* Saltwater crocodiles are in rivers throughout Indonesia. Avoid swimming around river estuaries and seek local advice in other locations.

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* regularly check weather reports as sea conditions can change rapidly
* take warnings seriously
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment and weather conditions before continuing with planned activities
* take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities
* be careful when swimming, snorkelling or scuba diving near motor-powered boats or where there is frequent passage of boats
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities

#### Climate and natural disasters

Indonesia experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [landslides and mudslides](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [volcanic eruptions](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* smoke haze
* storms resulting in turbulent sea conditions

#### Floods and mudslides

[Floods](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters), landslides and mudslides occur regularly during the wet season, which usually runs from October to April. However, the wet season can be different in Eastern Indonesia, which runs from April to August. Some severe weather events result in injury, displacement, death or damaged infrastructure.

Heavy rains can cause significant flooding in urban areas, including the greater Jakarta region, causing disruption to transportation. Monitor the local media for updates.

Walking and driving in flooded areas can be dangerous. Flood waters may hide uncovered drainage ditches.

#### Volcanoes

There has been recent volcanic activity at Mt Lewotobi Laki-Laki. Flights between Australia and Bali may be affected by ash clouds. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

Volcanic activity may escalate with little or no notice, leading to flight disruptions and airport closures, including in surrounding provinces. Contact your airline for the latest flight information.

There are over 120 volcanoes in Indonesia. 76 of them are active volcanoes and could erupt at any time.

Volcanic alert levels and exclusion zones may rise quickly. You may be ordered to evacuate at short notice. Volcanic activity can disrupt domestic and international flights. There are 4 volcano alert levels in Indonesia; 1 - normal, 2 - advisory, 3 - watch, 4 - warning.

Before you travel to areas that are prone to volcanic activity, monitor the media and ensure you read the Indonesian Government's latest advice on current volcanic activity, including:

* follow evacuation orders
* read our advice on [Volcanic eruptions while travelling](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/volcanic-eruption)

Volcanic ash can cause breathing difficulties. The risk is higher for people with chronic respiratory illnesses, including:

* asthma
* bronchitis
* emphysema

Recent and frequent volcanic activity has included:

* Mount Ibu in North Maluku (Maluku Utara) Province
* Mount Ile Lewetolok in East Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Timur) Province
* Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in East Flores Regency, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province
* Mount Marapi in West Sumatra (Sumatra Barat) Province

#### Earthquakes

Indonesia is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") region. It has a high level of earthquake activity, that sometimes triggers tsunamis.

There are approximately 4,000 earthquakes across Indonesia every year. Around 70 to 100 of these are over 5.5 magnitude.

Earthquakes can cause death, injury and significant damage to infrastructure.

Strong earthquakes can occur anywhere in Indonesia. They are less common in Kalimantan and south-west Sulawesi.

To stay safe during an earthquake:

* know the emergency plans at your accommodation
* follow the instructions and advice of local authorities
* follow evacuation orders
* take precautions to avoid exposure to debris and hazardous materials, including asbestos

#### Tsunamis and high wave events

The Indian and Pacific Oceans experience more frequent, large and destructive tsunamis than other parts of the world.

There are many large earthquakes along major tectonic plate boundaries and ocean trenches.

High wave events can happen throughout coastal regions and between islands. They're caused by strong weather conditions and storms.

If you plan to surf, undertake water activities or travel by sea, check local conditions regularly.

If there’s a tsunami or high wave event:

* know the emergency plans at your accommodation
* follow the instructions and advice of local authorities
* don't travel by sea if it's not safe to do so
