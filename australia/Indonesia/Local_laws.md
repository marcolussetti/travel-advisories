# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in many parts of Indonesia. Take care not to offend.

Ensure you respect local religious beliefs, places of worship, traditional ceremonies and religious offerings. Do not climb sacred trees or take photographs that may be offensive, including at religious and cultural sites. It's sometimes illegal to take photographs in certain places in Indonesia. Obey signs banning photography. If you're travelling to Bali, read the Bali Provincial Government's official ['Do's and Don’ts'](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/article/detail/1686289659500/the-provincial-government-of-bali-issued-an-official-%E2%80%9Cdo-and-don%E2%80%99t%E2%80%9D-card-for-foreign-tourist-while-in-bali) advice for foreign tourists before you travel. Failure to observe local customs and laws may lead to criminal penalties and/or deportation. If in doubt, get advice from local officials.

Indonesian Parliament has passed revisions to its criminal code, which includes penalties for cohabitation and sex outside of marriage. These revisions will not come into force until January 2026.

Indonesia has signed into law revisions to the Electronic and Information Transactions Law (ITE Law). Tough penalties apply for defamation, hate speech, spreading hoaxes and uploading immoral content to the Internet. The law applies both within and outside Indonesia, to both Indonesians and foreigners.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty.

You may face heavy fines or jail for consuming or possessing even small amounts of drugs, including marijuana. Cannabis-based products such as cannabis oil and cream, hemp, CBD, THC, hash and edibles, including for medicinal purposes, remain illegal in Indonesia. A medical prescription does not make it legal. If you take such products to Indonesia or purchase or use them in Indonesia, you can be arrested and face imprisonment, fines, deportation or the death penalty.

Some prescription medications that are available in Australia are illegal in Indonesia. Purchasing prescription medication online or over the counter in Indonesia without an Indonesian prescription is illegal. Ensure you provide a valid prescription from an Indonesian doctor before purchasing prescription medication in Indonesia and confirm that it's accepted by the seller before your purchase.

Magic mushrooms are illegal. Indonesian police work to prevent their distribution.

Police target illegal drug use and possession across Indonesia. Do not possess or use illegal drugs in Indonesia. Police often target popular places, recreation events and venues, including in Bali, Lombok and Jakarta.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are legal in Indonesia, except in the province of Aceh. Same-sex relationships in Aceh may attract corporal punishment. Visible displays of same sex relationships could draw unwanted attention.

Some laws and regulations can be applied in a way that discriminates against the LGBTQIA+ community, including for pornography and prostitution.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Indonesia. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during this time. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence and follow the advice of local authorities.

Explore our [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### Aceh

Aceh is governed as a special territory, not a province, and has a degree of special autonomy.

Sharia police enforce sharia law. This includes regulations and punishments that don't apply in other parts of Indonesia. Punishments may include caning, fines, and imprisonment.

Sharia law is intended for Muslims only. It may be applied to non-Muslims, including foreigners, in some circumstances.

Sharia law doesn't allow:

* gambling
* drinking alcohol
* prostitution
* same-sex relationships
* extra-marital sex
* co-habitation before marriage

It also requires a conservative standard of dress.

Take care to be respectful of local customs and social norms. Learn about the laws in Aceh. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Dual citizenship

Indonesia doesn't allow dual nationality for adults, and you may be prosecuted by Immigration authorities should you be found to hold valid passports of two nationalities. If you entered Indonesia on your non-Australian citizenship passport, Indonesian Immigration will require you to exit Indonesia on that nationality's passport.

A child of Indonesian and Australian parents can maintain citizenship of both countries until the age of 18 years. Before a dual Australian-Indonesian citizen minor travels from Indonesia, additional identity documentation may be required from Indonesian Immigration. Visit an Indonesian Immigration Office in person, contact [Indonesian Immigration](https://www.imigrasi.go.id/hubungi) or the [Indonesian Embassy in Canberra](https://www.kemlu.go.id/canberra) well in advance of your planned travel.
