#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including emergency treatment and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Before you travel, confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away, including on all forms of transport you plan to take
* whether it covers medical evacuation in the event of hospitalisation or injury
* any exclusions to your policy

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are illegal in Indonesia.

If you plan to bring over-the-counter or prescription medication, check if it's legal in Indonesia by visiting the [Indonesian Embassy in Canberra advice on bringing prescription medication to Indonesia](https://kbri-canberra.go.id/en/menu-customs.html) and contacting the [Indonesian Embassy in Canberra](https://www.kemlu.go.id/canberra) well in advance of your planned travel. Take just enough legal medicine for the duration of your stay, and carry it in its original packaging with a receipt from your pharmacy.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* details of your medical condition
* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for medical treatment or use, and for your personal use only

On arrival in Indonesia, you may be asked to complete an [Indonesian Food and Drug Authority form](https://jdih.pom.go.id/download/rule/1535/28/2023) outlining your prescription medication. An example of the form and information that could be requested is found on [pages 15 and 16](https://jdih.pom.go.id/download/rule/1535/28/2023) (Bahasa Indonesia and English translation).

If you're caught with illegal medicine, you could face detention, fines or harsher penalties. You could face charges even if an Australian doctor prescribed the medication.

Purchasing prescription medication online in Indonesia without an Indonesian prescription is illegal. Ensure you provide a valid prescription from an Indonesian doctor before purchasing prescription medication and confirm that it's accepted by the seller prior to your purchase. Authorities monitor the delivery of illegal medication from overseas and within Indonesia.

Read the [Indonesian Embassy in Canberra's advice on bringing prescription medication to Indonesia](https://kbri-canberra.go.id/en/menu-customs.html) or seek advice from the [Indonesian Embassy in Canberra](https://www.kemlu.go.id/canberra) before you travel.

#### Medicinal cannabis and cannabis-based products

Cannabis-based products such as cannabis oil and creams, hemp, CBD, THC, hash and edibles, including for medicinal purposes, remain illegal in Indonesia. A medical prescription does not make it legal. If you take such products to Indonesia or purchase or use them in Indonesia, you can be arrested and face imprisonment, fines, deportation or the death penalty.

#### Health Risks

#### Mpox

To prevent the entry of new variants of Mpox to Indonesia, all travellers arriving at international ports in Indonesia are required to complete an electronic health declaration form called the [SATUSEHAT Health Pass](https://sshp.kemkes.go.id/register).

You can complete the form online before you check-in for your flight to Indonesia. After completing the form, a barcode containing your health and travel history will appear. Indonesian authorities will scan the barcode on arrival in Indonesia. Save your barcode or bring a printed copy with you, to ensure authorities can scan it on arrival. If you have Mpox symptoms you may be referred to a hospital for treatment on arrival.

Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is significantly below the standard available in Australia. Medical evacuation may not be possible.

The Australian Government cannot guarantee your access to hospitals and other health services in Indonesia.

Medical evacuation to Australia for medical conditions, is possible but is very expensive and may not be covered by travel insurance. Check your policy before you travel.

#### Liquid/syrup medication

In 2023, there were cases of [Atypical Progressive Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in children](https://www.who.int/indonesia/news/detail/01-03-2023-investigation-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-children-in-indonesia--results-and-regulatory-actions) related to the use of contaminated liquid/syrup medication, including commonly used medications containing paracetamol and cough syrups. The purchase of liquid/syrup medication, especially for children, should be avoided.

#### Insect-borne illnesses

People have been poisoned by alcoholic drinks contaminated with harmful substances, including methanol and arak (a traditional rice-based spirit). Indonesian citizens and foreigners, including Australians, have died or become seriously ill from poisoned drinks.

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave food or drinks unattended. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fsafety%2Fpartying%23methanol&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C1a6539ec3139433d955108dd0ce9c732%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638680920391942531%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MuUR4Fb3UrVvnWGmL2TmgGLuMXbvf0um8xG231kDBXI%3D&reserved=0).

Cases of drink poisoning have been reported in Bali and Lombok.

Contaminated drinks have included:

To protect yourself from drink poisoning:

* consider the risks when drinking alcoholic beverages
* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks

Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

Symptoms of methanol poisoning can be similar to drinking too much. However, they are usually stronger.

Symptoms of methanol poisoning include:

* fatigue
* headaches
* nausea
* vision problems

Vision problems may include:

* blindness, blurred or snowfield vision
* changes in colour perception
* difficulty looking at bright lights
* dilated pupils
* flashes of light
* tunnel vision

If you suspect that you or someone you're travelling with may have been poisoned, act quickly. Urgent medical attention could save your life or save you from permanent disability.

Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the Indonesian police.

#### Magic mushrooms

Don't consume magic mushrooms. They're illegal.

Australians have become sick or injured after taking magic mushrooms.

Australians have been in trouble with local police after taking magic mushrooms, particularly in Bali.

Magic mushrooms can cause major health problems, including:

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is present and is a risk throughout Indonesia, including at tourist destinations. Rabies is 100% fatal. It is mainly transmitted by dogs, cats and monkeys, but can be transmitted by sea and land mammals.

To protect yourself from rabies:

* get vaccinated prior to travel
* avoid direct contact with dogs
* don't feed or touch animals
* avoid contact with other animals, including bats and monkeys

Talk to your doctor about getting a pre-exposure rabies vaccination.

If bitten or scratched by an animal:

* immediately use soap and water to wash the wound thoroughly for 15 minutes
* seek urgent medical attention

Rabies treatment in Indonesia may be limited. The rabies vaccine is not available everywhere in Indonesia, and rabies immunoglobulin is generally not available at all to treat rabies if you contract it. If you're bitten, you may need to return to Australia or travel to another country for immediate treatment.

You're at risk of contracting rabies if you visit a market where live animals and fresh food are sold because:

* live rabies-positive dogs may be present
* rabies-positive dog meat may be sold as food

Selling dog meat for human consumption is a breach of government disease control regulations.

Avoid contact with monkeys, even in places where you're encouraged to interact with them. This includes:

* popular markets
* tourist destinations
* sanctuaries
* forests

#### Legionnaires' disease

Cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported in people who have travelled to Bali. Travellers who are unwell with flu-like symptoms within 10 days of returning from Bali are advised to consult their doctor.

* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=health-topics/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw food, such as salads

To minimise the risk of food poisoning, only eat meat from reputable suppliers.

Seek urgent medical attention if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Seafood toxins

You can become sick from naturally occurring seafood toxins, including:

* [ciguatera fish poisoning](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/staying-healthy/food-pantry/food-safety-for-consumers/potentially-hazardous-foods-processes/seafood/naturally-occurring-seafood-toxins)
* [scombroid (histamine fish poisoning)](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/staying-healthy/food-pantry/food-safety-for-consumers/potentially-hazardous-foods-processes/seafood/scrombroid-histamine-food-poisioning)
* [toxins in shellfish](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/staying-healthy/food-pantry/food-safety-for-consumers/potentially-hazardous-foods-processes/seafood/naturally-occurring-seafood-toxins)

#### Tattoos

Avoid temporary black henna tattoos. The dye often causes serious skin reactions.

Before you get any tattoo, check the hygiene and safety of your tattoo provider.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Indonesia is generally lower than Australia. Many regional hospitals only provide basic facilities.

Hospitals expect families to provide support to patients, including all financial support.

Psychiatric and psychological services are limited in Indonesia. Hospital staff may use physical restraints on patients.

When diving in Indonesia, there is a risk that you may experience decompression illness. An illness may occur when a diver ascends to the water surface too quickly and may have severe consequences. Understand the risks before you dive.

Decompression chambers are available in various areas, including the following locations:

* Bali's Sanglah General Hospital
* Siloam Hospital in Labuan Bajo
* Regional General Hospital Mataram City in Lombok
* Hospitals in Jakarta, Balikpapan, Bintan, Medan, Makassar, Raja Ampat (Waisai), Maluku, Tual and Manado near popular dive sites

Before admitting patients, hospitals usually need:

* guarantee of payment from the patient or their next of kin (family or friend)
* confirmation of medical insurance
* deposit payment

There's no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and Indonesia.

The Australian Government cannot provide guarantee of payment, confirmation of medical insurance or a deposit payment for services.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Check your insurance policy before you travel. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs. It's best to check with your travel provider on the location and functionality of decompression chambers and other medical facilities available in the area before undertaking remote travel.
