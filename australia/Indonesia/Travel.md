#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Travel to Bali

Some flights between Australia and Bali have been cancelled or postponed due to volcanic ash from Mt Lewotobi Laki-Laki. If your flight is affected, contact your airline and insurance provider for alternative travel and accommodation arrangements.

Before travelling to Bali, read the [Bali Provincial Government's official 'Do's and Don'ts' advice](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/article/detail/1686289659500/the-provincial-government-of-bali-issued-an-official-%E2%80%9Cdo-and-don%E2%80%99t%E2%80%9D-card-for-foreign-tourist-while-in-bali) for foreign tourists. Failure to observe local customs and laws may lead to criminal penalties and/or deportation.

Foreign tourists entering Bali are subject to a tourist levy of IDR 150,000 per person. The tourist levy is separate from the e-Visa on Arrival or the Visa on Arrival. Cashless payments can be made online prior to travel or on arrival at designated payment counters at Bali's airport and seaport. Exemption from payment of the levy applies to transit passengers and certain visa holders. See the [Bali Provincial Government's](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/home) official website and [FAQs](https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/faq) for further information.

#### e-Visa on Arrival and Visa on Arrival

You can [apply for an e-Visa on Arrival (e-VOA)](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/) no later than 48 hours prior to travelling to Indonesia if you travel for tourism, visiting friends or family, attending business meetings, conventions or exhibitions as an attendee, purchasing goods or transiting only. Check the e-VOA requirements from Indonesian Immigration before applying.

You can still apply for a regular Visa on Arrival (VOA) at certain international airports, seaports and land crossings, including Jakarta, Bali, Surabaya, Makassar, Lombok, Batam, Medan, Manado, Aceh, Padang, Tanjung Pinang and Yogyakarta, if you do not apply for an e-VOA at least 48 hours in advance of your travel to Indonesia.

You cannot transit in Indonesia without an e-VOA or VOA. Ensure you have a passport with at least 6 months validity remaining and can pay for an e-VOA or VOA to ensure you can transit or enter Indonesia.

Additional requirements apply if you're travelling on government duties.

The e-VOA and VOA cost IDR 500,000 (approximately $A 50), with the e-VOA charging a small online processing fee.

For the VOA, some airports, including Jakarta's international airport, are only accepting cash payment. Card payment facilities are available at Bali's international airport. ATM facilities may be in high demand. Be prepared to pay in cash if required.

The visa is valid for a 30 day stay and can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by applying at an immigration office within Indonesia. Ensure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine and deportation.

To apply for a regular VOA, you must show:

* your ordinary (non-emergency) passport with at least 6 months of validity from the date you plan to enter. It's also recommended that you have at least 6 months passport validity from the date you plan to leave Indonesia, to avoid any issues for your departure or onward travel.
* a return flight booking to Australia or onward flight booking to another country

Contact your travel agent, airline, or your nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92) for details.

#### Other visas

If you're entering Indonesia from a port or airport that does not issue a visa on arrival, or you're visiting Indonesia for a purpose not allowed under the e-VOA or VOA conditions, you must apply for a visa in advance of travel. Check the [Indonesian Immigration](https://www.imigrasi.go.id/index?lang=en-US) website for further information or contact your nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92).

Overstaying your permit may result in fines, detention and/or deportation.

* check your visa and permit, and contact the [Directorate General of Immigration](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/front/info/contact-us) (DGI) or speak with the [DGI live chat function](https://www.imigrasi.go.id/) for advice specific to your needs
* if you use an agent to extend your visa or stay permit, use only reputable companies

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92)for details about visas, immigration, currency, customs and entry rules.

You can't work or conduct research in Indonesia unless you have the appropriate visa. Fines of IDR1,000,000 (approx. $A 100) per day apply for the maximum 60 day overstay period.

If you breach Indonesian immigration regulations, you may face:

* fines
* jail
* deportation
* re-entry bans

You may not be allowed to enter Indonesia if you have a criminal record. This is regardless of how long ago the offence took place. If you're concerned, contact an [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92) before you travel.

Indonesian Immigration and visa decisions are final. The Australian Government can't help you.

#### Border measures

Before entering Indonesia, ensure you understand your visa conditions and entry and exit requirements, including if you travel by private sea vessel. Check requirements with your travel provider, Indonesian Immigration, or the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92) before you travel. The Australian Government can't intervene in immigration, customs or quarantine matters in other countries.

To prevent the entry of new variants of Mpox to Indonesia, the Ministry of Health requires all travellers arriving at international ports in Indonesia need to complete an electronic health declaration form called the [SATUSEHAT Health Pass](https://sshp.kemkes.go.id/register).

You can complete the form online before you check-in for your flight to Indonesia. After completing the form, a barcode containing your health and travel history will appear. Indonesian authorities will scan the barcode on arrival in Indonesia. Save your barcode or bring a printed copy with you, to ensure authorities can scan it on arrival. If you have Mpox symptoms you may be referred to a hospital for treatment on arrival.

You'll be required to complete an [e-customs declaration for arrival](https://ecd.beacukai.go.id/). You can complete this within 3 days of departure to Indonesia.

Check entry requirements with your travel provider or the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92) before you travel.

#### Other formalities

If you're staying in a private residence, including private Airbnb, not a hotel, register when you arrive with both:

* the local Rukun Tetangga Office
* local police

If you wish to extend your visa:

* register your stay permit application and upload required documents through the [evisa.imigrasi.go.id](https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id/) website
* visit a local immigration office for an extension interview and photo
* make sure you have the right visa for your circumstances

#### Passport

#### Validity

Indonesia won't let you enter unless your passport has at least 6 months of validity from the date you plan to enter. You will also need at least 6 months passport validity from the date you plan to leave Indonesia, to avoid any issues for your departure or onward travel. This also applies even if you're just transiting or stopping over. There have been instances where travellers have become stranded, detained, or returned to their previous port overseas at their own cost.

Indonesia does not accept entry with an emergency passport, even if it's valid for more than 6 months. Ensure you enter Indonesia on a valid ordinary, official, or diplomatic passport.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply these rules inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy, Consulate or High Commission.](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Damaged Passports

Indonesian authorities have strict standards for damaged passports, and travellers have been refused entry into Indonesia with a damaged passport. Normal wear and tear, including water damage, minor tears or rips to the pages, can be considered damaged.

It's important that:

* there are no tears, folds or cuts in the passport pages, especially the photo page
* everything on the photo page is legible and clear
* there are no marks across your photo or in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) on the photo page
* no pages have been removed
* there is no alteration or tampering
* there is no sign of water damage on the cover of pages

If you're not sure about the condition of your passport, call the Australian Passport Office on 131 232 or contact your nearest [Australian embassy or consulate overseas](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx). We may need to see your passport to assess it.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the [nearest embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). Only exchange money at authorised money changers. Unauthorised money changers have been known to scam foreign tourists in Bali and elsewhere.

Declare cash in excess of IDR 100,000,000 or equivalent when you arrive and leave. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

IDR 100,000,000 is worth about $A 10,000.

#### Local travel

#### Travel Permits

You may need a travel permit or Surat Keterangan Jalan to travel to some areas of the Papua provinces.

Check if you need a permit with the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Indonesia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/92) or with your travel provider.

#### Mobile Phone Reception and Wi-Fi

Mobile phone reception and Wi-Fi are not always available, including in remote areas and some resort islands.

If you plan to stay in Indonesia for more than 60 days and would like to use your mobile phone purchased overseas, you'll need to register your mobile phone IMEI number with [Indonesian Customs](https://www.beacukai.go.id/register-imei.html) within the first 60 days of your stay.

If you plan to stay in Indonesia for less than 60 days, you can visit the local cellular operator/provider booth at the airport to get an access period to use the Indonesian cellular network, which is only valid for 90 days and includes data roaming.

A customs payment may be required, or a tourist SIM card can be purchased for short-term stays. You can use Wi-Fi networks without registration.

To stay in communication and avoid mobile service interruptions:

* check mobile coverage with your service provider
* register your mobile device with [Indonesian Customs](https://www.beacukai.go.id/register-imei.html) on arrival if you plan to connect to the mobile network

#### Driving permit

To drive in Indonesia, you need either:

* an Indonesian licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Check that your licence or permit is appropriate for the type of vehicle you're driving, including motorbikes.

Your Australian licence isn't enough.

Your travel insurer will deny any claims you make if:

* you're unlicensed
* you don't hold the correct class of licence

#### Road travel

Traffic can be extremely congested.

Road users are often unpredictable or undisciplined.

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Indonesia than in Australia. Drive defensively. Some traffic incidents can escalate into violent disputes quickly. Obey traffic laws, including obtaining appropriate driving or motorbike licenses before travelling to Indonesia.

Consider hiring an official taxi or a driver who is familiar with local roads and traffic conditions. If you hire a car, taxi or driver, make sure you do so from legal companies. Only use licensed official metered taxis. See ‘Safety’.

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

Motorcycle accidents have killed and injured foreigners, including Australians. This includes in tourist areas, particularly Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands.

If you're riding a motorbike and there's an accident, you'll often be assumed to be at fault. You may be expected to compensate all parties.

If you hire a motorbike:

* make sure your insurance policy covers you
* check if any policy restrictions apply, for example if you're not licensed to ride a motorcycle in Australia

Always wear a helmet.

#### Public transport

Buses, trains and the metro rail can be crowded, particularly:

* around public holidays
* during peak commute times

Safety standards may not be observed.

**More information:**

* [Transport and getting around safely](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport")

#### Taxis

Only use licensed, official metered taxis or official ride-hailing services that use app-tracking meters and have official contact details. Ensure your driver is using a map when driving.

To protect yourself from overcharging and scams:

* only travel in licensed taxis with signage, a "taxi" roof sign and meters
* ensure the driver's identification card is visible
* book via phone or an official taxi company mobile app

You can book licensed official metered taxis

* by phone
* on the taxi company's official mobile app
* from inside airports
* at stands at major hotels

Unofficial operators can have taxis that look similar to those run by reputable companies. Make sure the taxi meter is working before you get into the taxi and confirm the driver is following the map.

See [Safety](#safety).

#### Rail travel

Inter-city rail networks operate on the islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.

Commuter trains operate in Java, including Jakarta.

Trains can be crowded, particularly:

* around public holidays
* during peak commuter times

#### Marine Transport

Travel by boat or ferry can be dangerous. Commercial and private boat and ferry operators may not comply with international safety and maintenance standards. Australians have been seriously injured or have died in marine transport incidents. 

Passenger and luggage limits aren't always observed.

Equipment may not be properly maintained, and they may not have GPS or emergency communications equipment.

There may not be enough life jackets. It's unlikely that the crew will have life jackets for children.

In April 2025, an explosion occurred on a boat travelling from Nusa Lembongan to the Gili Islands, resulting in the hospitalisation of one passenger. 

In March 2025, a tour boat capsized in rough seas near Nusa Penida, one person died and 12 passengers were injured. 

In March 2024, a ferry sank in the Thousand Islands off the coast of Jakarta, resulting in one death, and a liveaboard boat caught fire and sank in Raja Ampat, Papua Barat Daya, requiring several passengers to be rescued.

In August 2023, two crew died after a boat carrying passengers sank in the Banyak Islands, Aceh, and three people went missing after a ship sank in the Thousand Islands off the coast of Jakarta.

In July 2023, 15 people died after a ferry sank off Sulawesi Island.

In January 2023, 23 passengers and 6 crew were rescued after an inter-island ferry sank while returning from Nusa Penida to Sanur Beach, Bali.

If you plan to travel by sea between islands:

* make sure any ferry or boat you board has appropriate safety equipment, GPS and communication equipment, and life jackets
* wear a life jacket at all times
* take enough life jackets for all children travelling with you
* ask your tour operator or crew about safety standards before you travel
* check sea, weather conditions and forecasts before embarking on boat or ferry travel, and delay travel if conditions are not safe

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Avoid travelling by water after dark unless the vessel is properly equipped. Avoid travel during wet weather or storms.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Indonesia's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PK) with the Aviation Safety Network.

The European Union (EU) has published a list of airlines that have operating bans or restrictions within the EU. See the [EU list of banned airlines](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-safety-list_en).

Australian travellers should make their own decisions on which airlines to travel with.
