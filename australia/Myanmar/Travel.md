#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter and stay in Myanmar. Entering without a visa can result in a prison sentence.

Contact the nearest Immigration Office to extend your visa if you intend to lengthen your stay in Myanmar.

If you choose to travel, despite our advice, you can obtain further information and apply for a tourist or business visa at your nearest [Myanmar embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/138) or the [Ministry of Immigration and Population](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) website.

The Australian Embassy is not able to support individual visa applications.

You can't use e-Visas at seaports.

Be aware of unauthorised websites that claim to offer e-Visas. Some websites will provide a genuine visa for an extra fee, but others are fake.

Be careful about using links in emails or other websites to access the official site. Use official Myanmar government services to arrange your visa to avoid being scammed.

The local government strictly controls travel to parts of Myanmar, including through visa conditions. Authorities have deported or detained Australians for visa offences.

You should maintain a valid visa at all times.

If you overstay your visa, authorities won't let you leave until you pay a fine. You might also be:

* arrested
* deported
* blacklisted, so you can never return

If you break other visa conditions, authorities could arrest or deport you.

Meet your visa conditions at all times.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/138) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border requirements

Ensure you have a valid visa prior to travel and meet Myanmar's entry requirements. The Australian Embassy cannot support your request to board an incoming flight.

The following entry requirements apply:

* In response to the [Mpox global public health emergency](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/mpox-global-public-health-emergency), you are required to complete a health declaration form on arrival.
* If you contract COVID-19 during your stay in Myanmar, you must isolate until tested negative.

Confirm entry requirements directly with your nearest [Myanmar Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/138) and the Ministry of Health and Sports, as quarantine protocols are subject to change at short notice.

#### Departing Myanmar

There are international flights departing Yangon and Mandalay. Book directly with airlines or through your travel agent.

#### Border crossings

Travel to or from Myanmar by land border crossings can be unpredictable. Crossings can be opened or closed without prior notice.

Since November 2016, foreigners have not been allowed to travel to the Muse (Shan State)-Ruili (China) border crossing.

See [Safety](#safety)

#### Other formalities

#### Staying in Myanmar

You must stay in registered hotels and guesthouses.

If you plan to stay for more than 90 days, you must register your address with immigration authorities. You must also obtain a Foreigners Registration Card.

Let Immigration know if you change hotels or will be away from your registered address.

Customs regulations are restrictive. Officials limit what you can bring into the country.

Declare foreign currency over $US10,000 or equivalent when you arrive and depart Myanmar. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. If you don't, you could be jailed.

Customs authorities are sensitive about some communications equipment such as:

* drones
* radio equipment

If you don't declare restricted or banned items, customs may confiscate them. You may be able to collect undeclared items when you leave the country.

Strict rules control the export of:

* local gems
* antiques
* Buddha images

If you plan to take something home, check it's legal before you buy it.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Office](https://www.passports.gov.au/passport-care/lost-and-stolen-passports#what%20do%20I%20do) on 131 232
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Myanmar Kyat (MMK).

Cash is widely used but may be difficult to access. Ensure you have enough cash on hand should shortages and banking disruptions occur.

A limited number of shops and businesses accept US Dollars as payment. Notes with pen marks, folds or tears, and old notes are often refused. Foreign currency is sometimes refused because of people using fake notes.

Other foreign currencies and travellers' cheques are rarely accepted.

It's illegal to exchange foreign currency except through authorised money changers. Find official money changers at Myanmar's international airports and in banks.

The banking sector has experienced widespread disruption, with many banks closed and some ATMs out of operation. Restrictions are in place regarding the use of foreign currencies, including using foreign currency bank accounts and limits on the amount of USD that can be held in cash. Ensure you comply with requirements.

There are daily and weekly limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs. Plan your travel accordingly. Some ATMs accept international cards.

Ask your bank if your card will work in Myanmar.

Credit and debit cards are widely accepted at:

* hotels
* shops
* restaurants

You should confirm before travel if intending to pay for hotels or restaurants with a credit or debit card. Vendors often charge additional fees for credit or debit card transactions.

Many businesses will not accept international cards, e.g. Mastercard, Visa or American Express.

International money transfers to Myanmar may be restricted.

#### Local travel

The military administration controls travel within parts of Myanmar, including to and from land border crossings.

If despite our advice you plan to travel within Myanmar, check movement restrictions with local authorities. Visit the [Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population](http://www.mip.gov.mm/restricted-areas-for-foreigners-tourist-travelling-in-the-country/) website for a list of restricted areas.

A curfew is in place across Myanmar. Stay at home during curfew hours.

Movement restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, curfews and quarantines, may be imposed at short notice (see [Safety](#safety)). Monitor the media closely.

Australian Embassy staff need to seek approval to undertake official travel within Myanmar. This may affect our ability to provide consular assistance.

#### Landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)

Unmarked landmines and IEDs make parts of Myanmar dangerous. These devices are used in:

* areas of conflict
* near borders
* city and urban areas

Landmine locations may not be marked. Stay on established roads.

#### Myanmar New Year and Water Festival

Myanmar's Water Festival (Thingyan) and New Year is celebrated in April each year. There's an increased risk of road accidents due to:

* drunk drivers
* overcrowded vehicles

In past years, crime has increased during the festival. Pay attention to your personal security.

Many services close down for Thingyan, including:

* shops
* supermarkets
* restaurants
* banks
* government offices

Roads are sometimes closed in Yangon and other regional centres. Plan ahead.

#### Identification

Travellers are often asked to show their passport and visa to authorities. This often occurs:

* for domestic air travel
* for train travel
* when staying at hotels

Foreigners who stay in Myanmar for more than 90 days have to show their Foreigners Registration Card.

#### Local safety standards

The safety standards you might expect of service providers are not always met. This applies to:

* hotels
* restaurants
* shops
* transport and tour operators, including for adventure activities

Operators may not provide suitable safety equipment. Maintenance and safety standards may be poor or non-existent.

If you plan to do an adventure activity:

* check if your insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Internet and telephone services

Communication services in Myanmar are restricted in many parts of the country.

Internet services are available but are unreliable outside cities and large towns. Restrictions on internet access apply, including to some websites, social media and messaging applications.

The phone network is also unreliable and limited outside of cities and large towns.

You can send and receive text messages only from some Australian mobiles to mobile phones inside Myanmar. Many travellers buy a local pre-paid SIM card.

If you're subscribing for urgent travel advice updates by SMS, ensure you can receive text messages on your phone number.

The military administration has in the past, suspended telecommunications services in response to the security situation without prior notice. 

#### Driving permits

It's illegal to drive cars or motorbikes using an Australian or international driving licence.

You must have a valid Myanmar driver's licence.

You can apply for this through the [Road Transport Administration Department Myanmar](http://www.myanmarrtad.com/).

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in Myanmar than in Australia.

Roads in Myanmar are dangerous because of:

* traffic congestion
* aggressive driving practices
* poorly maintained vehicles and roads
* people and livestock on the road
* lack of street lighting

Roads in mountainous border areas can be particularly poor. Many drivers in regional areas don't use their headlights at night.

Vehicles drive on the right-hand side of the road. However, both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles are used throughout the country. This adds to the dangerous driving conditions.

Australian Embassy staff are advised to avoid travelling by car in the countryside at night. This includes travelling on the Yangon-Naypyitaw-Mandalay highway and National Highway 1, linking Yangon and Mandalay. There are reports of attacks on these expressways.

Military and immigration checkpoints on roads are common, including in Yangon and other major cities.

If you plan to drive:

* check your travel insurance covers you
* get a local licence
* become familiar with Myanmar traffic laws

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Companies that hire motorbikes often don't supply helmets. Most helmets bought locally don't meet Australian safety standards.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Registered taxis have red licence plates and are easy to find.

Agree on the fare with the driver before your trip.

Take extra care if using taxis at night. Availability of taxis are limited near curfew. Allow adequate time to return to your accommodation prior to curfew.

Many taxis are in poor condition.

Registered rideshare services operate in Yangon.

#### Public transport

[Public transport](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport") doesn't meet international safety standards. This includes:

* buses
* boats
* trains

Fatal accidents have occurred, especially at night.

Search and rescue resources are very limited.

#### Air travel

Domestic airlines may sometimes implement travel restrictions due to the security environment. Changes to travel protocols and flight availability may occur at short notice.

The safety record of domestic airlines is not available. There is no data about how well local planes are maintained. This lack of transparency raises concerns about airline safety.

Airlines operating in Myanmar sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. When this happens, passengers are not told in advance.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Myanmar's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XY) with the Aviation Safety Network.
