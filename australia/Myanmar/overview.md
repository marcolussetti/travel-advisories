# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to Myanmar. Violence, including explosions and attacks, can occur anywhere and anytime, including in Yangon. Attacks may be planned against locations that foreigners frequent, including public spaces and civilian infrastructure. Attacks are unpredictable in their location and intensity. Remain aware of the security environment at all times. Minimise movement, especially on anniversaries and days of national significance, and monitor media closely. There've been widespread detentions, including of foreigners.   
  
Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention. If local authorities consider you are a citizen of Myanmar, you may be required to serve in the armed forces. In response to the global Mpox public health emergency, you're required to complete a health declaration form on arrival. If you are an Australian-Myanmar dual national holding an Australian passport, you may not be exempt from this law. Be aware of offers of employment that appear 'too good to be true'. Foreign nationals have been trafficked into Myanmar (either directly into Yangon or via a neighbouring country) and forced to work in fraudulent activity, with poor pay and living conditions, restrictions on movement, and severe mistreatment.

## Overview

### Safety

* Explosions and other security incidents occur in Yangon and frequently in other parts of the country. Attacks are unpredictable in their location and intensity. Attacks may be planned against locations frequented by foreigners, including public spaces and civilian infrastructure, such as hotels and serviced apartments, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, schools, petrol stations and supermarkets. Minimise movement, especially on anniversaries and national days of significance. Monitor media for updates. We advise you to read the '[Full advice - Safety - Security situation and Armed conflict sections](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/myanmar#safety)' for more information.
* Since the Myanmar military assumed control of the country, there's been a significant increase in the level of violence, with many deaths and injuries. There have been widespread detentions, including of foreigners. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention.
* There are active conflicts between armed groups and security forces across many States and Regions, especially in the northwest and southeast of the country. Armed groups operate along Myanmar's borders with China, Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh and India. This includes official border crossings. There are also unmarked landmines and the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). If you choose to travel to these areas despite the risks, carefully assess the security situation, including curfews and travel restrictions.
* If, despite our advice, you remain in Myanmar, you should stay at home during curfew hours and follow stay-at-home orders. Avoid using any routes through known traffic checkpoints and any travel adjacent to regime-affiliated businesses and government buildings. Monitor the media and keep in close contact with friends and family. The economic and business environment remains unpredictable. The Australian Embassy's ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be limited.
* Heightened security arrangements are in place for Australian officials. Australian officials follow protocols for staff movements and use enhanced security measures, including for travel outside Yangon.
* There've been a number of cases where foreign nationals have been trafficked into Myanmar (either directly into Yangon or via a neighbouring country) and forced to work in online scamming or other fraudulent activity, with poor pay and living conditions, restrictions on movement, and severe mistreatment. Exercise caution concerning offers of employment that appear 'too good to be true'.

### Health

* Medical facilities in Myanmar are severely stretched by the security situation, particularly outside Yangon. Hospitals have closed or ceased providing services at short notice. Medical evacuations may be delayed or not possible. Talk to your travel or insurance provider. Be particularly cautious if you have an existing medical condition.
* Medication sold in Myanmar can be fake. Ensure you have enough legal medication for the duration of your stay.
* Common insect-borne diseases include malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Consider taking anti-malarial medicine. Ensure all your vaccinations are up to date before travel.
* Many animals in Myanmar carry rabies. It's fatal without immediate treatment. Don't feed, pat or tease dogs or monkeys. Get medical assistance immediately if an animal bites or scratches you.
* Polio is a risk. Hepatitis-A and typhoid also occur. If you're staying for more than four weeks, carry proof of your polio vaccination. Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases such as hepatitis, typhoid, cholera and tuberculosis are common. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. HIV/AIDS is common. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

### Local laws

* Myanmar authorities often don't tell consular staff about Australians they've arrested, detained or deported. If you're arrested or jailed ask to contact the Australian Embassy immediately.
* A 2010 conscription law has come into effect following an announcement by the military administration. If local authorities consider you to be a citizen of Myanmar, you may be required to serve in the armed forces. The length of service can depend on criteria such as age, occupation, and whether there is a state of emergency. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality. You may not be exempt from this law if you are an Australian-Myanmar dual national holding an Australian passport.
* Myanmar has strict communications laws, including laws being considered to prohibit the use of VPNs. Financial or criminal penalties may apply. Don't post negative comments about individuals or Myanmar on social media.
* Myanmar has strict religious laws. It's illegal to take religious materials in or out of the country without approval. Preaching or handing out religious material without approval is also illegal. There's also a law against 'insulting religion', including mistreating images of Buddha. Cover any Buddha tattoos. People in Myanmar are deeply respectful of their religious and cultural traditions. Don't wear shorts or sleeveless tops, especially at religious sites. Always remove your shoes and socks before entering a site.
* Customs rules are restrictive. Seek prior permission to import drones or radio equipment. Drones have been seized by customs officials and tourists have been arrested for operating drones. There are also strict rules about exporting gems, antiques and images of Buddha. Check items are legal before you buy them.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Punishments include the death penalty. Same-sex relations and adultery are illegal. Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military personnel or sites.

### Travel

* If you decide to travel to Myanmar despite our advice, there are international flights to and from Yangon and Mandalay. Book directly with airlines or through your travel agent.
* In response to the global [Mpox public health emergency](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/mpox-global-public-health-emergency), you are required to complete a health declaration form on arrival.
* You must stay in registered hotels and guesthouses. Register your address with immigration authorities if you're staying more than 90 days. Inform the authorities if you change hotels or will be away from your address.
* The military administration restricts travel in parts of the country, including to and from land border crossings. The Australian Embassy's ability to provide consular service, including in an emergency, may be extremely limited. States and regions of Myanmar are affected by armed conflict. If you intend to travel, check the restricted area list with local authorities. Carry your passport or Foreigners Registration Card. Officials may ask to see it.
* Driving cars or motorbikes on an Australian or international licence is illegal. Apply for a local licence through the [Road Transport Administration Department (Burmese)](https://www.myanmarrtad.com/).
* Don't drive in the countryside at night, including on the Yangon–Naypyitaw–Mandalay highway and National Highway 1 linking Yangon and Mandalay. There are reports of attacks on these expressways. Don't leave the scene of an accident. Public transport, including buses, boats and trains, fail to meet international safety standards. Fatal accidents have occurred, especially on overnight trips.
