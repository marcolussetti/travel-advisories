# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws should you choose to travel to, or remain, in Myanmar despite our advice.

In February 2024, the military administration announced a 2010 conscription law would be enacted. If local authorities consider you are a citizen of Myanmar, you may be subject to serve in the armed forces. The length of service can depend on criteria such as age, occupation, and whether there is a state of emergency. Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality. You may not be exempt from this law if you are an Australian-Myanmar dual national holding an Australian passport.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Myanmar authorities don't always notify consular staff about Australians arrested, detained or deported from Myanmar. If you're [arrested or jailed](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/arrested-jailed), ask to contact the Australian Embassy immediately.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty.

#### Traffic accidents

It's illegal to leave the scene of an accident. Drivers involved in an accident with another vehicle are usually detained if there are injuries. A driver involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault, regardless of what happened. Authorities are likely to detain the driver.

Legal cases to resolve traffic disputes can be long. They can affect your visa status. Drivers often expect a cash payment to settle the matter at the time of the accident.

You could be charged costs for injuries or damaged vehicles. The embassy can't help you negotiate. However, they can give you a list of lawyers who may be able to assist.

#### Other laws

Myanmar has the death penalty for serious offences, including murder, treason, and drug-related crimes.

These activities are illegal in Myanmar:

* engaging in same-sex sexual acts or adultery
* taking photos of military personnel or sites
* entering or leaving Myanmar with religious materials without Customs approval
* preaching or handing out religious materials without written approval
* 'insulting religion', including mistreating images of Buddha - if you have a tattoo of Buddha, keep it covered
* defaming or threatening someone using a telecommunications network
* operating drones around sensitive areas such as, government or religious buildings

It's also illegal to:

* rent a private home if you're on a tourist visa — tourists must stay in registered accommodation
* drive a car or motorcycle without a valid local driving licence
* leave the scene of a road accident
* drink alcohol in public places such as parks, religious buildings or compounds

Don't post negative comments about individuals or Myanmar on social media.

Customs laws on banned imports and exports can be unclear and change without notice. Ask a [Myanmar embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/138) about the latest rules.

#### Dual citizenship

Myanmar doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your Australian passport.

#### Local customs

People in Myanmar are deeply respectful of their religious and cultural traditions.

Standards of dress and behaviour are modest.

It's considered offensive to touch or pat anyone on the top of the head.

Respect local customs and take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Dress

Avoid wearing sleeveless tops and shorts in Myanmar, especially when visiting religious sites. It may cause offence.

Always take off your shoes and socks before entering religious sites.
