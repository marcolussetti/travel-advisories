#### Travel insurance

If you choose to remain in, or travel to, Myanmar despite our advice, make sure you have comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") for the duration of your stay.

Confirm what your policy covers, including activities, care, and health and travel disruptions. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel where the travel advice is 'do not travel'.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need
* arrange appropriate medical supplies

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Counselling services

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Health risks

Medical facilities in Myanmar are severely stretched, particularly outside Yangon. Hospitals have closed or ceased providing services at short notice. Medical evacuations may be delayed or not possible.

#### COVID-19

Some [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about) restrictions continue to apply in Myanmar. Stay-at-home orders have been used in the past to curb transmission.

You can find [information on COVID-19 in Myanmar](https://www.mohs.gov.mm/) on the Ministry of Health and Sports website (Burmese). 

If authorities assess you have COVID-19, you may be required to isolate at home or be quarantined at a local facility.

#### Polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases

Check the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/) (Department of Health and Aged Care) if you chose to travel to Myanmar despite our advice.

Make sure you're up to date with recommended vaccinations, including [polio](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/poliovirus-infection) (Department of Health and Aged Care). You may need a booster.

Speak with your doctor. If you're not sure if you're vaccinated for polio, ask. Also check your need for vaccines for:

* [typhoid](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/typhus.aspx)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [hepatitis A](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

#### Insect-borne diseases

In many areas, insect-borne diseases are widespread. These include:

* [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)
* [dengue fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection )
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya )
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you leave Australia

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is common in Myanmar. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) can be fatal. It's found in various animals in Myanmar.

Never feed, pat or tease dogs or monkeys.

If a dog, monkey or other animal bites or scratches you, get treatment as soon as possible.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common and include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/typhus.aspx)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get urgent medical help if you think you have food poisoning, or if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medication

Shortages of medications occur, even for the most basic items. Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Myanmar. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Get advice from a [Myanmar embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/138) on quantity restrictions that may apply.

Be aware that medications for sale in Myanmar are often fake.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Myanmar is extremely limited, particularly outside Yangon. Medical facilities will not be to the standard of those in Australia. Hospitals have closed or ceased providing services at short notice. Medical evacuation is likely to be necessary for serious illness or injury.

Avoid any surgical procedures, including dental work. Unclean medical instruments can cause infections such as:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids)

Emergency medical care, including ambulances, is often not available. An ambulance service (often without a paramedic) is attached to most private hospitals. Each has its own phone number. In areas with an overnight curfew, such as Yangon, it can be difficult to access emergency healthcare during the night.

Private hospitals may not be able to accept foreign patients. You may need to pay cash up-front before receiving medical treatment.

If you become seriously ill or experience a major injury, a medical evacuation may be delayed or not possible.
