# Safety

#### Security situation

The Myanmar military assumed control of the country and declared a state of emergency on 1 February 2021. There has been a significant increase in violence, with many deaths, injuries and arrests.

There have been widespread detentions, including of foreigners. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention. Do not take photos of protests, and military personnel or sites.

Martial law is in place in areas of Myanmar, including some areas of Yangon. Avoid townships under martial law. Exercise caution if you need to be there.

A curfew is in place from 1am to 3am in the Yangon region. Curfew timings may differ in other regions and may change at short notice. Daily internet outages, restrictions and regular power outages may occur unexpectedly in Yangon and other parts of the country.

Heightened security arrangements are in place for Australian officials. Australian officials follow protocols for staff movements and use enhanced security measures at all times, including for travel outside of Yangon.

There are disruptions to basic services, including banking, communications, power and public health. Have arrangements in place for your essential needs. Services such as transport, travel and fuel may be affected.

If, despite our advice, you choose to remain in Myanmar, you should minimise movement and stay at home during curfew hours. Follow stay-at-home orders. The economic and business environment remains unpredictable. The Australian Embassy's ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be limited. [Maintain heightened security awareness](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/theres-armed-conflict), monitor the media, and keep in close contact with friends and family.

Australians in need of emergency consular assistance should contact the Australian Government 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre at +61 2 6261 3305 (or 1300 555 135 if calling from Australia).

#### Armed conflict

There are active conflicts involving armed groups and security forces across Myanmar. Explosions and other security incidents targeting security forces occur within Yangon and in other parts of the country. Attacks have resulted in civilian and military casualties and are unpredictable in their location and intensity.

Attacks may be planned against locations that are also frequented by foreigners such as hotels, apartments, restaurants and public spaces.

Armed conflict includes:

* active fighting between armed groups
* targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hotels and serviced apartments, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, schools, petrol stations and supermarkets
* use of artillery, mortars and surface-to-surface missiles
* improvised explosive devices and unmarked landmines
* civil unrest, violence and abductions
* attacks on days of national significance
* aerial bombings and air strikes from helicopters and fixed wing aircraft

If despite our advice, you choose to travel to higher risk areas:

* minimise movement and plan your trip carefully including communications
* find out about local information such as curfews and travel restrictions
* stay on main highways and in urban areas, noting even these may be dangerous

The use of Improvised Explosive devices (IEDs) and attacks has occurred across most parts of the country. Most IEDs and attacks have targeted military and government buildings, police stations and military-affiliated businesses. The public remains at risk, including in urban areas.

Security forces are present in urban areas, including Yangon, which increase around days of significance and visits of regime and foreign officials. Checkpoints and barricades with armed security personnel are common and road/bridge access can change without notice. To the extent possible, avoid using any routes through known traffic checkpoints and any travel adjacent to regime-affiliated businesses and government buildings.

#### Rakhine and southern Chin State

Armed conflict between armed groups and military forces is occurring in northern and central Rakhine.

Risks to civilians due to the conflict have included being kidnapped, detained and killed by armed groups and killed or injured in clashes and artillery and air strikes, including in Sittwe. Telecommunications have been cut in northern and central Rakhine, and road links to other parts of Myanmar have been severed due to ongoing fighting. Armed groups have used explosive devices in Rakhine State, including on main roads. Travellers have been kidnapped from public buses and ferries. Familiarise yourself with local curfews and travel restrictions.

#### Shan State

Fighting between rival ethnic groups, and between armed groups and Myanmar security forces in Shan States has increased since October 2023. The fighting has resulted in civilian casualties and displacement. Civilians including foreigners have been attacked along main roads, displaced, and killed or injured by landmines.

#### Kachin State

Kachin is also affected by conflict. Since the coup, there has been an influx in troop numbers and violent clashes. Civilian infrastructure, including roads and bridges, are often cut off or targeted for attack.

#### Kayin and Kayah States

There is conflict and violence across Kayin and Kayah states with increased troop numbers and violent clashes. Myanmar military forces have regularly employed airstrikes and heavy artillery. Numerous attacks have occurred in urban areas, with significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including religious buildings, health centres, and civilians. There is a large, displaced population in both states. Access is unpredictable, with numerous roadblocks and checkpoints. Many roads are completely cut off due to ongoing fighting. Telecommunications, electricity and internet connectivity disruptions occur regularly across the southeast of Myanmar.

#### Sagaing, Magway and Chin States

Conflict and violence is ongoing across Sagaing, Magway and Chin States affecting urban areas and resulting in large numbers of civilian displacement. Instances of violence and attacks are unpredictable in location, scale and severity. Internet and communication services are heavily restricted in some areas. Security forces are actively monitoring road and transportation routes and often restrict movement.

#### Mon State and Tanintharyi Region

Conflict in Kayah and Kayin has spilled over into Mon and Tanintharyi. Roadblocks and checkpoints are present, and there is an increased military presence and conflict in select townships. Internet connectivity disruptions occur regularly.

#### Myanmar’s Border Areas

Security along Myanmar's large border varies. Armed groups operate in border areas including at land border crossings. Several border crossings remain closed.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist and anti-regime attacks in Myanmar, carried out by a range of actors, have targeted government buildings, including military-affiliated regime schools, hospitals, hotels, shopping centres and public transport.

Since the military takeover, the incidence of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and attacks has increased and resulted in a highly volatile environment where violence occurs across the entire country. While security forces or administrative elements appointed by the ruling council are the primary targets, civilian-used infrastructure and public spaces may be targeted. There is a high threat of clashes between armed groups and the military in major urban centres and the threat to the public remains high.

To stay safe:

* take official warnings seriously and follow local instructions
* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the news for any new or emerging threats

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case there's a secondary attack.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protest activity is infrequent but can occur randomly. Protests and organised assemblies of people are not permitted. National dates of significance may see rallies and silent strikes and there's a higher likelihood of opposition attacks, including:

* Independence Day (4 January)
* the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February)
* Armed Forces Day (27 March)
* Martyrs’ Day (19 July)
* the anniversary of the 1988 uprising (8 August)
* the anniversary of demonstrations led by monks (26 September)

These events often see an increase in police and security forces presence in Yangon and elsewhere. Tensions may be heightened. Exercise caution and:

* minimise movement and avoid all political gatherings and protests
* avoid areas cordoned off by security forces, areas of known or possible unrest, facilities and vehicles linked to security forces and the military administration
* don't take photographs of rallies, the military or police
* follow instructions of local authorities, including stay-at-home orders, and curfews
* monitor the media and other news sources for possible unrest
* be extra careful around public holidays and other important dates and events such as elections

Be alert to rapid changes in restrictions, including on the use of communication devices and VPNs.

#### Crime

Crime rates in Myanmar, while once lower than other countries in the region, have dramatically increased since the coup. Economic pressure may increase the crime rate further.

You could encounter:

* [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [petty theft](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [burglary](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")

To help protect yourself against theft:

* pay close attention to your belongings, particularly in crowded areas
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in ways that make them harder to snatch

When using credit cards or ATMs:

* avoid exposed locations – choose ATMs in banks and shopping centres
* check for skimming devices before use
* protect your PIN
* monitor your bank records

Report any theft straight away to local police. See [Local contacts](#local-contacts)

Exercise caution in relation to offers of employment that appear 'too good to be true'. Foreign nationals have been trafficked into Myanmar (either directly into Yangon or via a neighbouring country) and forced to work in online scamming or other fraudulent activity, with poor pay and living conditions, restrictions on movement, and severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated and been held for ransom.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.   

Reporting indicates that kidnapping has increased in Myanmar since 2021, especially in rural areas where criminal groups engage in a range of illicit activities. Criminal kidnappers target a range of victims for financial gain. 

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.  

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:  

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel, and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Cyclones

Cyclones can happen between April and October. Confirm the location of your local shelter as soon as possible.

Check the [Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology](https://www.moezala.gov.mm/) for news on conditions.

#### Earthquakes

Earthquakes occur in Myanmar.

Past earthquakes have damaged major cities in Myanmar, including Yangon and Bagan.

Myanmar's exposure to earthquakes makes destructive tsunamis more likely.

If there's a natural disaster:

* take official warnings seriously
* don't enter areas affected by flooding, landslides or other natural disasters without advice from local authorities
* know your hotel's evacuation plans
* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* keep in contact with friends and family
* monitor the media, other local news and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
