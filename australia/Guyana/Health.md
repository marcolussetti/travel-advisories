#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Guyana. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Check if you need [DFAT to certify](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-services/apostilles-authentications-certificates-of-no-impediment-to-marriage/Pages/apostilles-authentications-and-certificates-of-no-impediment-to-marriage.aspx) your medical documents.

Don't bring medicine without these documents. If you do, you risk refusal of entry or prosecution.

#### Other health risks

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common. Take precautions before you do anything that exposes you to the risk of infection.

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/diseases) are common. These include:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [leptospirosis](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/leptospirosis)

More severe outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* ​​drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Seek urgent medical help if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Guyana are very limited. They lack trained specialists and medical equipment. Hygiene standards are poor.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll be evacuated to a place with better facilities, such as the US. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
