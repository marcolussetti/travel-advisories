#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

Australians visiting Guyana don't require a visa to enter.

Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, and extensions can be requested from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.minfor.gov.gy/) in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay.

#### Visa conditions

Entry and exit conditions change regularly. Contact the [High Commission of Guyana](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/84) for details about visa, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Departure tax

Departure tax is incorporated into your ticket, so you are no longer required to make this payment at the airport.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Guyana. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever).

#### Travel via the United States

If you travel through the US, you must meet US entry or transit requirements.

Check our [US travel advice](/destinations/americas/united-states-america "United States of America") for entry conditions.

#### Travel via Canada

If you transit or travel via Canada by air, you'll need a Canadian eTA (electronic Travel Authorisation).

Check our [Canada travel advice](/destinations/americas/canada "Canada") for entry conditions.

#### Passports

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The Guyanese dollar is the official currency of Guyana.

Declare money you're carrying if it's more than US$10,000, or equivalent. Do this on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

#### Local travel

The interior regions of Guyana can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* dense jungle or savannah
* sparse population
* poor access to services, including emergency services
* unreliable mobile phone reception

Take safety gear if travelling to interior regions. This may include:

* all-weather jackets
* first aid kits
* a satellite phone

#### Border crossings

Border disputes take place along:

* the Suriname to Guyana border
* the Venezuela to Guyana border

If you need to cross the Guyana border:

* only use official border crossing points between countries
* take scheduled ferry services at official river crossings

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Guyana than in Australia.

Driving in Guyana can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* aggressive driving
* inadequate street lighting
* flooding on roads

Pedestrians are often killed on roads.

Crime increases at night on the road from Georgetown to Cheddi Jagan International Airport. This includes armed robbery.

If you plan to drive in Guyana:

* book flights that arrive or depart during the day
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when driving

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe if you use a reputable company.

Ask airport and hotel staff about official taxi services.

Don't hail taxis from the roadside. Robberies and assaults have occurred.

#### Public transport

Buses are often overcrowded and poorly maintained.

Avoid using minibuses. They:

* drive dangerously
* are involved in most road accidents, including fatal ones

#### Sea travel

It's illegal to use an independent boater to enter Suriname. You may be fined, detained or deported.

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") occurs on Guyana's coastal waters.

To protect yourself while travelling by sea:

* avoid using water taxis to travel to other countries
* get an entry stamp in your passport if you travel into another country
