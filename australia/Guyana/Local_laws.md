# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

Prison conditions are harsh. Pre-trial detention can last for years.
