#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime resulting in serious injury or death is a problem, particularly in Georgetown. Incidents include:

* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* shooting
* carjacking

Armed robberies and [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") can occur in:

* shopping areas
* private cars
* taxis
* hotels
* other businesses

Law enforcement is generally cooperative but can't respond effectively to serious crimes.

Hotspots for crime include:

* the Stabroek Market, South Georgetown, the Botanical Gardens and the Tiger Bay areas of Georgetown
* East Coast Demerara, particularly near the villages of Buxton, Lusignan Friendship and Annadale
* the East Bank Demerara region
* New Amsterdam
* Bartica
* Essequibo River tourist resorts

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night.
* avoid Georgetown sea wall after dark
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour

#### Drink Spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Personal safety

Avoid travelling or walking alone.

* on the road from the Cheddi Jagan Airport to Georgetown
* on the Timerhi-Linden Highway
* in East Coast Demerara region

[Muggings](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and shootings have occurred in these areas.

#### Hotel safety

To protect yourself in case of an emergency, if you stay at a hotel in Georgetown:

* find the hotel emergency procedures
* know your evacuation route
* speak to hotel staff

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is not common in Guyana. Most recorded incidents have occurred in Georgetown. Armed ‘pirate’ attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Guyana have occurred.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

If you choose to travel in this area, you should:

* monitor media to stay informed on the situation

#### Demonstrations and protests

Avoid protests and large public gatherings. These can turn violent.
