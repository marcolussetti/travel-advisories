#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks have happened in Uzbekistan and could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Regional political tensions and conflict add to security threats. Threats are more severe in Uzbekistan's border regions.

#### Border with Afghanistan

The high threat of terrorist attacks makes [Afghanistan](/destinations/asia/afghanistan "Afghanistan") very dangerous.

The last reported incident of terrorists raiding into Uzbekistan was in 2022*.*

#### Borders with Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic

Security in the regions bordering [Tajikistan](/destinations/asia/tajikistan "Tajikistan") and the [Kyrgyz Republic](/destinations/asia/kyrgyz-republic "Kyrgyz Republic") is volatile.

Occasionally, there is armed conflict in rural areas in the east of Uzbekistan. The conflict is between extremist or criminal groups and government forces.

#### Landmines

There are unmarked landmines in parts of Uzbekistan bordering Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.

If you travel to these areas despite our advice, be alert to possible hazards.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations can turn violent. Ensure you have security plans in place.

In 2022, violent protests occurred in Karakalpakstan, leading to injuries and deaths.

If you travel to these regions despite the risks, monitor developments. Security may worsen without warning. Have other plans ready.

To stay safe during civil unrest:

* avoid large gatherings and protests
* monitor the media for possible unrest
* follow the advice of local authorities

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Crime

You could encounter crime in Uzbekistan.

Thieves target foreigners, often with pickpocketing and other petty crimes.

[Robberies](/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged "I've been robbed or mugged overseas") occur, especially on trains and in unofficial taxis.

Some criminals pose as police officers then rob victims.

Crime levels are higher at night, including on trains.

There have been reports of harassment, mistreatment and extortion by police and other local officials.

To stay safe, be very careful in all parts of Uzbekistan and:

* don't walk alone
* monitor the media for new safety or security risks

#### Drink Spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Uzbekistan is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") happens:
