#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australians can enter Uzbekistan under a visa-free arrangement. It covers single-entry stays of up to 30 days.

You'll still need a visa if you're staying for more than 30 days or need multiple entries.

**More information:**

* [Uzbek Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://gov.uz/en/mfa)

#### Visa rules

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Embassy of Uzbekistan in Singapore](http://singapore.mfa.uz/site/index?language=en) (accredited to Australia) for details about visas and other travel requirements.

Uzbek visas specify validity, number of entries, and length of stay. Check your visa details when you get it.

The length of stay on your visa may differ from the length you asked for in your application.

Authorities may fine, detain or deport you if you:

* arrive in the country before the visa validity period
* overstay your visa

#### Border measures

The land border with Afghanistan is closed until further notice.

Contact your airline or your nearest [embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/foreign-embassies/pages/foreign-embassies-and-consulates-in-australia.aspx) to confirm entry requirements.

#### Other formalities

Declare all medications and other restricted items on arrival (see '[Health')](#health).

Contact your airline or your nearest [embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/foreign-embassies/pages/foreign-embassies-and-consulates-in-australia.aspx) to confirm visa and entry requirements.

#### Stays of more than 3 days

If your stay is for 3 or more days, weekend days included, you'll need to register with local authorities.

Register in each city in which you intend to stay. Most hotels do this for their guests, but you're legally responsible.

Confirm with check-in staff that they have registered you.

If you stay in private accommodation or your hotel doesn't offer this service, register either:

* at the local Department of Foreign Travel and Exit Registration Office (OVIR), or
* through the [online registration system](http://reg.emehmon.uz/ )

#### Border crossings

Uzbekistan's borders with neighbouring countries can close without notice.

The land border with Afghanistan is closed until further notice.

Some border crossings may only be open to local residents.

There are currently two border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan open to international travellers: Izboskan and Dostyk.

Check with local authorities which border crossings are open and if they're available for you to pass through. Do this before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If you get a new passport, make sure you get your Uzbek visa transferred into your new passport. If your visa is in a cancelled or expired passport, you may not be able to exit or enter the country.

**More information:**

* [Embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/214) of Uzbekistan, if you're outside Uzbekistan
* Your local Uzbek Visa and Registration Office, if you're in Uzbekistan

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Uzbekistan is the Uzbek Som (UZS).

Rules apply to the import and export of foreign currency.

Complete 2 customs declaration forms on arrival. Customs authorities will keep one form. Keep the other form because you'll need to show it when you leave.

**More information:**

* [Uzbek Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://gov.uz/en/mfa)
* [Uzbek State Customs Committee](https://customs.uz/en)
* [Embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/214) of Uzbekistan

#### Access to money

Banks, hotel exchange offices and the currency exchange office at the new terminal of the Tashkent airport exchange UZS for US dollars.

Uzbekistan is mostly a cash economy. However, some places accept:

* credit cards
* debit cards, mainly Visa
* traveller's cheques

Traveller's cheques in Australian dollars are not accepted.

Ask your bank if your ATM card will work in Uzbekistan. ATMs are often broken or out of cash.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Unmarked landmines are a threat in regions bordering Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic (see ['Safety')](#safety).

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Uzbekistan if you have both:

* an Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before departing Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in Uzbekistan as in Australia.

Hazards include:

* poor roads
* poor driving standards
* lack of street lighting
* lack of street signs
* livestock and animal drawn carts on roads
* pedestrians crossing roads without warning

Rural roads are particularly treacherous, including in the Tian Shan and Fan Mountains.

Drivers must pay a fee to bring cars into Uzbekistan. The size of the fee depends on how long you'll stay. Pay at border crossings.

You need an official permit for any travel to:

* Termez on the Afghan border
* areas of Surkhandarya in the south-east

Security checkpoints are common.

There aren't many service stations in rural areas.

Check you have the right insurance before driving.

If you plan to drive:

* learn local traffic laws and practices
* get local advice on road conditions in rural areas
* avoid travel at night
* be alert to hazards especially at night
* don't drink and drive
* obey police signals to stop, including at checkpoints

Driving to border regions is risky. If you do, check in advance if the borders are open.

#### Motorcycles

Check your insurance policy covers you using a motorcycle, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and limousines. Arrange them through your hotel if you can.

#### Public transport

If you plan to take the bus or train, check your itinerary carefully. Some domestic routes transit through bordering countries.

If this is the case, make sure you hold:

* an Uzbek multiple-entry visa
* visas for the transit countries

Rail travel can be unreliable and dangerous due to crime.

#### Air travel

On 11 April 2022, the EU announced that 21 Russian-owned airlines were banned from flying in EU airspace due to safety concerns.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. If you're flying domestically or internationally, you should research your aviation provider.

Check [Uzbekistan's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=UK) with the Aviation Safety Network.
