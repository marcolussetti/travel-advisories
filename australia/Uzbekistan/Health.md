#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Sleeping tablets or medicines containing codeine are controlled in Uzbekistan.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Uzbekistan. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry copies of your prescription and a letter from your doctor, translated into Russian or Uzbek. The letter must state:

* your diagnosis
* the name of the prescription
* the required dosage
* the length of time you need to take it
* that it's for personnel use

Declare all medications on arrival. You could face fines or criminal charges if either:

* you don't declare a medication, or
* the quantity exceeds legal limits

Officials may charge you for undeclared or excessive medicine quantities even if you have a doctor's prescription and letter.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/214) for advice.

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is prevalent. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Travel in forested areas may expose you to tick bites. Ticks can carry diseases. Ticks are very common in country areas and are most active from spring to autumn.

To reduce your risk of tick-borne disease:

* regularly check your body for ticks during and after visits to forest areas
* remove ticks from your body as soon as possible

To protect yourself from illness:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are prevalent. These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

More serious outbreaks occur from time to time.

To protect yourself from illness:

* in rural areas, drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes in rural areas
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited in Uzbekistan. Medicines and equipment are often in short supply.

You often need to pay in cash up-front before doctors or hospitals will treat you. This includes for emergency care.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
