# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in Uzbekistan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include lengthy prison sentences served in local jails.

**More information:**

* [Carrying or using drugs](/node/103)

#### Other laws

Police often ask to check your identity. Always carry your passport and visa.

Things that are illegal in Uzbekistan include:

* same-sex relationships
* not declaring medications you're carrying on entry (see '[Travel')](#travel).

It's also illegal to take photos of:

* government or military buildings
* public transport infrastructure, including metro stations

* [LGBTQIA+ travellers](/node/349)

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Uzbekistan doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/node/46) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Uzbek citizenship

Under Uzbek law, an Uzbek citizen loses their Uzbek citizenship when they become a citizen of another country.

If you're an Uzbek citizen and you become an Australian citizen, you must notify Uzbek authorities.Â  Within 30 days, notify either:

* the Uzbek Ministry of Interior
* the nearest Uzbek embassy or consulate

**More information:**

* [Embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/214)

#### National service

Uzbekistan has national service obligations.

If you keep your Uzbek citizenship and visit Uzbekistan, you may need to do national service.

There are penalties for citizens of Uzbekistan who serve in the military or security forces of another country.

#### Permit to depart

You'll need a 'permit to depart Uzbekistan' if you're a dual national using your Uzbek passport. You need the permit when you travel in Russia and in neighbouring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.

If you don't have the permit or if it has expired, you may face difficulties at border control stations.

Our ability to help you may be very limited in these cases.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/214) to find out how to get or renew this permit. Do this before you enter any of the CIS countries or Russia on an Uzbek passport.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, dress conservatively and seek local advice.

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Uzbekistan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
