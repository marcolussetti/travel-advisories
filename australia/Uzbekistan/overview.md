## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks have happened in Uzbekistan. Future terrorist attacks could target places popular with foreigners. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities.
* The security situation is volatile in Uzbekistan's border regions. Landmines are also a risk in this region. If you decide to travel to border regions despite our advice, pay close attention to your personal security. Monitor the media for new risks.
* Demonstrations and violent protests are common in Andijan and the eastern region of the Ferghana Valley. Avoid large gatherings and protests. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Pickpocketing and robbery can occur. Thieves target travellers. The risk is higher on trains and in unofficial taxis. More crimes happen at night. Carry only what you need and don't walk alone.
* Some criminals pose as police officers to rob people. There have been reports of harassment, mistreatment and extortion by police and other local officials.

### Health

* Uzbekistan has strict controls on importing certain medicines, including psychotropic medication. Sleeping tablets or medicines containing codeine may also be restricted. Declare all medication and other restricted items on arrival.
* HIV/AIDS is prevalent. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.
* Ticks are active in country areas from spring to autumn. They can spread disease. Regularly check your body for ticks during and after visits to forest areas. Remove ticks from your body as soon as possible.
* Medical facilities are limited, and medicines and equipment are often in short supply. You may need to pay cash up-front before receiving treatment.

### Local laws

* Penalties for drug offences are severe and include lengthy jail terms.
* Always carry your passport and visa. Police often ask for proof of identity.
* It's illegal to have same-sex relations.
* It's illegal to take photos of government or military buildings and public transport sites.
* Uzbekistan doesn't recognise dual citizenship. This may limit the consular help we can provide. Dual nationals need a permit to depart Uzbekistan. Dual nationals may also be required to do national service. Always travel on your Australian passport.
* Law enforcement agencies in Uzbekistan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.
* Standards of behaviour and dress are conservative. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, ask locals for advice.

### Travel

You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Uzbekistan for the latest details.
* If you stay 3 or more days, you'll need to register with local authorities. Register in each city you stay in. Check if your hotel has done this for you.
* Borders with neighbouring countries can close without notice. Some border crossings may only be open to local residents. Ask local authorities about border conditions before you travel.
