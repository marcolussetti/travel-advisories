#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.   
  
Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation and adequate coverage for any pre-existing conditions. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care. 

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in French Polynesia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Dengue-type epidemics are common in French Polynesia, including [dengue type 2](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) epidemics.

Outbreaks of other insect-borne diseases can also happen, mostly in warmer and wetter months.

These include:

* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis), particularly in rural areas

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pains, a rash or a bad headache.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in French Polynesia varies. Medical standards are high in Papeete. Medical standards in rural areas and remote islands are basic.

Most doctors don't speak English.

You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be expensive. 

The standard of rescue and emergency services is high, but the travel time between Papeete and the outer islands may delay emergency responses.

The Central Hospital of French Polynesia in Papeete has a decompression facility. Reaching it from popular dive sites on other islands may take several hours.

There's no shared healthcare agreement between Australia and French Polynesia.

Make sure your insurance covers medical evacuation and your planned activities.
