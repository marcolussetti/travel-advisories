## Overview

### Safety

* The rate of serious crime is low. But petty crime, including theft, does occur. Take arranged transport and avoid walking after dark. Keep your belongings close, especially in crowded places or on the beach. Don't leave food or drink unattended.
* French Polynesia has natural disasters, including cyclones and tsunamis. Check with the [High Commission of France in French Polynesia (French)](http://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/) for updates. They also run a phone hotline during major emergencies. Your tour operator or accommodation provider may also be able to provide timely advice.
* Strikes and industrial disputes can lead to unrest and disrupt essential services, including transport links. Protests can turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings.
* The cyclone season is between November and April. However, tropical storms and cyclones are likely to occur at any time. Understand and follow French Polynesia's cyclone alert system.
* Tsunamis may occur and can arrive within minutes of a tremor or earthquake. Know the warning signs and move immediately to high ground.

### Health

* Dengue-type epidemics are common in French Polynesia. Other insect-borne diseases include chikungunya and filariasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Leptospirosis occurs in French Polynesia. Wear closed-toed shoes when walking and avoid contact with rivers or muddy water. Store food in sealed containers.
* Other infectious diseases include scabies, influenza, conjunctivitis and whooping cough. Attend to symptoms such as fever, itchiness and skin wounds. Tap water in Tahiti is usually safe to drink. Avoid raw and undercooked food. Outside Tahiti, drink boiled or bottled water.
* Ciguatera can be caught by consuming contaminated lagoon fish, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
* Beware of stonefish in swimming areas. Their sting can cause serious health issues and should be treated immediately.
* Yellow fever is not present. However, there are steps to prevent the introduction of the virus into French Polynesia. Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022))Health authorities may request proof of vaccination dating back more than 10 days from any traveller identified as having stayed in a risk zone.
* Medical facilities in Papeete are good, but those on other islands and outlying areas are basic. Ensure your travel insurance covers your condition and medical evacuation.

* By law, you must always have photo identification with you.
* Same-sex marriage is legal. However, outside the main tourist islands, you may encounter more conservative attitudes.
