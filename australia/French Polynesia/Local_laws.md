# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Local customs

Dress and behaviour standards are conservative outside the tourist areas of Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora.

Take care not to offend, especially outside tourist resorts. Dress appropriately when visiting shops and cities.

Visits to certain sacred sites (marae) may require prior authorisation. Check with local authorities before visiting any natural or historical site.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Under French law, same-sex marriage is legal. However, outside of the main tourist areas of Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora, you may encounter more conservative attitudes.
