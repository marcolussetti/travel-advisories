#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your airline, the [Embassy of France in Canberra](https://au.ambafrance.org/-English-), or the [Consulate of France in Sydney](https://au.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-General-in-Sydney-) for details about the latest visa and entry requirements.

#### Visa conditions

French Polynesia is an overseas territory of France.

You likely won't need a visa for a tourist visit of up to 3 months. However, the total length of your stay must not exceed a total of 90 days over a period of 180 days (6 months). 

You may need to show proof of the following:

* sufficient money for your stay
* accommodation
* means to return home or onward travel ticket
* adequate travel or health insurance
* the purpose of your visit

In other situations, you may need a visa.

#### Border Measures for by Air

Check with your airline or travel agent for the most up-to-date information on entry and exit regulations that apply to you prior to planning your trip.

Measures may change at short notice.

#### Border Measures by Sea

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

You should report your passport lost or stolen at the nearest police station.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Pacific Franc (XPF — Franc Pacifique).

You can change Australian dollars at the Tahiti-Faa'a International Airport, which is only open for international arrivals and departures. ATMs are located throughout Tahiti and on the main islands.

Credit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants, boutiques and supermarkets on the main islands. However, you may only be able to use cash:

* at smaller shops
* on remote islands and atolls
* in taxis

Take enough cash if you are travelling to remote islands.

#### Local travel

[Tahiti Tourism](https://www.tahititourisme.au/islands/tahiti/getting-there-and-getting-around/page/2/) provides information on getting around French Polynesia by road, air and sea.

Industrial and political disputes as well as strikes can cause disruptions to essential services including transport. Monitor developments and plan as required.

To learn more about strikes and civil disputes see '[Safety](#safety)'.

The road network is not developed, and traffic jams occur frequently. It can take a long time to drive a short distance. Seek local advice about road conditions when planning your travel to the airport or marina.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in French Polynesia on a valid Australian driver's licence for up to one year after arrival.

If you plan on staying in French Polynesia longer than one year, you can exchange your Australian licence for a Polynesian licence. 

Contact the [Department of Transport in French Polynesia](https://www.service-public.pf/dtt/) for more details.

#### Road travel

In French Polynesia, as in France mainland, cars drive on the right side of the road, and rental cars are left-side driver. Pay attention if you rent a car.

Take care driving, particularly at night. Many roads are narrow and unpaved.

Many traffic accidents are linked to driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* keep your car windows up and doors locked
* don't drink and drive
* follow the advice of local authorities

An increasing number of taxis accept credit cards in Tahiti; however, most only take cash, especially on the outer islands.

Many outer islands don't have taxis.

* check sea and weather conditions before embarking on boat or ferry travel, and delay travel if conditions are not safe
