#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

* local transport
* domestic and international flights

Avoid demonstrations and crowds.

If there's a strike:

* check on your flights before going to the airport
* ask your tour operator if it affects tourist services
* follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Violent crime

The rate of serious crime is low in French Polynesia, however [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") can occur.

#### Petty crime

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations with social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
