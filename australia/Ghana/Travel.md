#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You'll need a visa to travel to Ghana.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an embassy or [high commission of Ghana](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/76) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

**Border measures**

You need to show a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate when you arrive.

Measures are frequently reviewed and may change at short notice. Check the [Kotoka International Airport website](https://www.accra-airport.com/) for details.

#### Other formalities

#### Ghanacard

If you'll stay in Ghana for more than 90 days in a year, you must register for a [National Identification Authority Non-citizen Ghanacard](http://nia.gov.gh/). You'll need this for ID checks on some transactions.

#### Passports

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Money facilities

The local currency is the Ghanaian Cedi (GHS).

Declare all GHS or other currency when you arrive in Ghana. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can't exchange Australian dollars in Ghana. However, you can easily exchange US dollars and euros for GHS at commercial banks and exchange services.

Larger towns have ATMs. Banks and businesses may not accept credit cards other than Visa.

Credit card fraud is common.

To ensure your access to money:

* always keep an eye on your credit card, even when you're using it
* contact your bank to make sure your cards will work

#### Local travel

Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence. 

Chieftaincy disputes and political tension can sometimes lead to localised violence and unrest across Ghana. 

There have been an increasing number of reported incidents of banditry involving passenger buses travelling in the Upper West and Upper East regions resulting in injuries and deaths. In January 2024, unidentified gunmen attacked a bus travelling on the Walewale-Bolgatanga highway, resulting in several injuries. 

There are security risks with using [public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/366). See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/ghana#safety)

#### Driving permits

You can drive in Ghana for 12 months with:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must be over 18 years old.

After 12 months, you'll need a local licence.

#### Road travel

[Road safety and driving](/node/352) in Ghana can be dangerous, due to:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* aggressive driving
* poor street lighting
* roaming animals
* pedestrians and cyclists

These risks increase at night and in rural areas.

Police roadblocks are common. These will often happen in major cities after dark. You may need to show:

* identity documents
* vehicle registration
* ownership papers

If you can’t produce your identity documents, vehicle registration or ownership papers, police may fine you or ask for a bribe. If this occurs, don’t hand over your money or your passport, but ask for their name tag and identification number.

During the wet season, flooding can make roads impassable.

Crowds can quickly gather at the scene of traffic accidents and become aggressive.

To stay safe on the road:

* understand local traffic laws and practices
* carry photo ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers
* be alert to hazards, especially at night
* get local advice on road conditions, especially during the wet season
* always keep car windows up, doors locked and valuables out of sight
* be wary of people who may try to stop your vehicle

If you're in an accident, go to the nearest police station.

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance policy may not cover you for accidents while driving a motorbike or quad bike. Check before you drive.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines. If you can, arrange these through your hotel.

There are security risks with using unregistered taxis and rideshare services.

Take care when travelling alone at night (see [Safety).](#safety)

#### Public transport

Public transport is limited.

Safety and maintenance standards can be unreliable.

There are security risks with using [public transport](/node/366) (see 'Safety').

#### Sea travel

Ferry travel is risky due to generally low safety standards and adverse weather.

There may be too many passengers and not enough life jackets. Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.

[Pirates](/node/358) operate in the coastal areas of Ghana. Check piracy reports with the [International Maritime Bureau](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).
