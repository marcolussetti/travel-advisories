#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Ghana. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is, including its generic name
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Ghana.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) is common in Ghana. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) and other insect-borne diseases are also common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common in Ghana. Take precautions if taking part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Lassa fever

[Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever) may be a risk when you have contact with rodents or with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings.

To protect yourself from disease:

* avoid contact with live or dead rodents, burrows or nests and their droppings
* ensure all foods are well-cooked and covered in rodent-proof containers
* keep your body, personal belongings, utensils and common contact surfaces (including door knobs and counters) clean
* avoid places where dust is raised, such as from sweeping and vacuuming rodent droppings
* avoid contact with infected people, body fluids and infected items

Get immediate medical help if you develop any symptoms of Lassa fever, including a fever, weakness in your body or unexplained pain.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [meningococcal meningitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [dengue fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

Get medical attention straight away if an animal scratches or bites you.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in urban areas are basic.

In rural areas, facilities are limited. The standard of care may be less than what you would expect in Australia.

You may need to pay cash upfront before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.
