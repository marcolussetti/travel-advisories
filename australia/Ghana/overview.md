## Overview

### Safety

* There's been an increase in reported incidents of banditry involving passenger buses travelling in the Upper West and Upper East regions resulting in injuries and deaths. In January, unidentified gunmen attacked a bus travelling on the Walewale-Bolgatanga highway, resulting in several injuries.
* If you're travelling to Ghana, you could be a target for violent crime, including assault, sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery. There are increased security risks if you're a woman travelling alone. Take particular care in and around Accra, crowded markets and along tourist beaches.
* A curfew is in place from 8pm to 5am covering Walewale and its surrounding areas in the North East Region. You should plan your travel movements to avoid breaking the curfew and follow the directions of local authorities.
* There's a heightened risk of terrorist attacks in the northern areas of Ghana bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Togo and Burkina Faso. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places, and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Avoid demonstrations and protests. Large public events and intercommunity disputes can turn violent. Be cautious around large crowds, including at football matches.
* Internet scams often originate in West African countries. Criminals may ask for details of safe bank accounts to transfer large amounts of money. Criminals often meet their victims through internet dating sites or chat rooms. Be wary of online contact from people you don't know. Don't send money until you've checked who you're sending it to. Don't travel to Ghana to get your money back or to get revenge.
* Power outages may occur after dark. This often leads to more crime, especially if street and traffic lights fail.
* Officials or people posing as officials may try to extort money from foreigners, including at the airport. Legitimate airport staff wear a current ID card with their name and photograph.

### Health

* There's currently an outbreak of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa. Mpox can be fatal. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* Yellow fever, malaria and other insect-borne diseases are common, as are waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases, such as cholera, hepatitis, lassa fever, dengue fever, meningococcal meningitis, bilharzia and tuberculosis. Avoid insect bites, ice cubes, and raw or undercooked food. Drink boiled or bottled water. Consider what vaccinations and medicine you need.
* Lassa fever may be a risk when you have contact with rodents or with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings.
* HIV/AIDS is common in Ghana. Take precautions if you're engaging in high-risk activities.
* If there is a serious outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Medical and emergency services are very limited. You may need to pay cash up front, even in an emergency. Make sure you have the right insurance and enough money to cover all your costs.

### Local laws

* You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Some activities that are legal in Australia are illegal in Ghana.
* Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include mandatory jail terms.
* Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. LGBTQIA+ relationships and identities are widely regarded as unacceptable. Violence, threats, extortion, eviction and arbitrary arrest of LGBTQIA+ people occur, and the debate around an anti-LGBTQIA+ bill has increased these risks to the LGBTQIA+ community. LGBTQIA+ travellers should consider travel plans and personal security carefully.
* Ghana recognises dual nationality. Always travel on your Australian passport.

### Travel

* You need a visa to travel to Ghana. If you're staying for more than 90 days in 12 months, you must register for a [National Identification Authority Non-citizen Ghana card](http://nia.gov.gh/). Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest high commission/embassy or consulate of Ghana for the latest details.
* You need to show a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Ghana. You may also need to show it when you leave.
* There's increased reporting of incidents involving passenger buses travelling in the Upper West and Upper East regions resulting in injuries and deaths.
* Road safety and driving in Ghana can be dangerous. Police roadblocks are common. Carry photo ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers. Be alert to hazards, especially at night. Only use registered taxis and limousines. Arrange these through your hotel. Due to safety and security concerns, don't use public transport or taxis hailed on the street.
