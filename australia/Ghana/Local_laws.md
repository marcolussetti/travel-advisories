# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Some activities that are legal in Australia are illegal in Ghana. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drug laws

Penalties for drug offences are severe. This includes mandatory jail terms.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. LGBTQIA+ relationships and identities are largely regarded as socially unacceptable despite not being illegal in Ghana.

Violence, threats, extortion, eviction and arbitrary arrest of LGBTQIA+ people occur, and the debate around an anti-LGBTI bill has increased these risks to the LBGTQIA+ community. LGBTQIA+ travellers should consider travel plans and personal security carefully.

#### Other laws

It's also illegal to:

* carry pornographic material
* wear military style or camouflage clothes
* take photos near government buildings or infrastructure, such as oil fields
* import or export natural resources such as gold, diamonds and precious metals without a licence from the Precious Metals and Mining Commission

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Ghana recognises dual nationality.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Travelling on your Ghanaian passport may affect your rights and responsibilities, including:

* civil service
* military service
* access to Australian [consular services](/node/117) if you're arrested or detained.

Check with the [High Commission of Ghana](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/76) before you travel.

You can get a dual nationality card from the Ghana Ministry of Interior.

Check with locals. Take care to not offend.
