# Safety

#### Crime

#### Theft

If you're travelling to Ghana, you could be a target for:

* mugging
* bag snatching
* petty theft
* pickpocketing

Your risk increases if you're a woman travelling alone. Take particular care in and around Accra.

Some taxi passengers have been robbed by drivers.

Attacks on passengers in vehicles are also on the increase. Take particular care when stationary. Keep windows up and doors locked. Some of these attacks on vehicles also involve the use of weapons.

Power outages may occur after dark. This often leads to more crime, especially if street and traffic lights fail.

Criminals may also target you in:

* house invasions
* [armed robbery](/node/344) (including in a taxi)
* other violent crimes

Officials or people posing as officials may try to detain foreigners or extort money from them, including at the airport. Legitimate airport staff wear a current ID card with their name and photograph.

To protect yourself from crime:

* only use registered taxis or limousines, arrange these through your hotel
* don't use taxis hailed on the street or other public transport
* don't walk alone, particularly in the evening and at night
* avoid travelling alone, especially if you're a woman
* keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* be alert when approaching traffic lights
* lock your accommodation, including when you're inside

#### Scams and fraud

Internet [scams](/node/363) come in many forms, including romance, friendship, business and employment opportunities. These scams often originate in West African countries.

If you travel to West Africa as a scam victim, you're at risk of:

* financial loss
* [kidnapping](/node/57)
* [assault](/node/354)
* robbery
* murder

This includes travelling to meet a friend or love interest, as well as trying to seek compensation or revenge.

Common fraud schemes fall into two main categories — commercial and relationship scams.

In commercial scams, criminals ask for details of 'safe' bank accounts to transfer large amounts of money. They may:

* promise a percentage of this amount to you
* send fake cashier cheques for urgent goods shipments
* request large fees for a fake government contract
* extort money from you for a bogus business opportunity

In relationship scams, criminals often meet their victims through internet dating sites, chat rooms or social media. Once they've made a connection with you, they may:

* ask you to send money so they can come to Australia
* ask you to come to Africa to meet them

Once you transfer money, the relationship often ends. If you travel to Africa to meet the criminals, you may be in danger.

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked details about them

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Ghana to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Chieftaincy conflicts, land disputes and political tension can lead to localised inter-ethnic violence and civil unrest throughout Ghana, especially in Upper West and Upper East Regions.  

Due to the ongoing chieftaincy conflict in Bawku, there's an increased risk of politically motivated attacks in the Upper West and Upper East Regions. 

There's been an increase in reported incidents of banditry involving passenger buses travelling in the Upper West and Upper East regions resulting in injuries and deaths. In January 2024, unidentified gunmen attacked a bus travelling on the Walewale-Bolgatanga highway, resulting in several injuries. 

Pay attention to your personal safety and surroundings.

Be cautious around large public gatherings like football matches.

Disputes involving local ethnic groups can also turn violent.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests, demonstrations and strikes can occur with little warning, in response to political or economic issues. Strikes may affect essential services across Ghana. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. 

When you're in Ghana:

* avoid protests, rallies and demonstrations
* if you encounter a protest or unrest, leave if it's safe to do so
* monitor the media for reports of unrest, and avoid those areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of protests or strikes. If your travel plans are affected, you can contact your:

* airline
* travel agent
* travel insurer

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. This includes in Ghana. There's a heightened risk of terrorist attacks in the northern areas of Ghana bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Togo and particularly Burkina Faso, where terrorists, other armed groups and militias are active.

An attack could happen anywhere and at any time.

* consider likely targets and level of security provided, including places visited by foreigners, such as shopping centres.
* always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.
* report any suspicious items or activities to the police.

To protect yourself from being involved in a terrorist attack:

* monitor the media for possible threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there’s a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it’s safe to
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling, including in Ghana. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically lower risk.

Criminals increasingly target foreigners for violent crime in Ghana. This includes [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping). Scammers may kidnap you to seek a ransom for your release.

There is a threat of kidnapping across Ghana. The risk is higher in northern Ghana, including the Upper West and Upper East regions. If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance may be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings, particularly at night
* get professional security advice for travel to locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* avoid predictable movements.  Vary travel routes and times, particularly on your usual routes
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* don't display money or valuables
* use ATMs inside banks, hotels and shopping centres during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services arranged through your hotel
* when travelling by road, keep windows up and doors locked, especially at night

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

See the 'Crime' section under 'Safety' for more details.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Ghana experiences [natural disasters](/node/346) and [severe weather](/node/347), including flooding.

If there's a natural disaster or severe weather:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact friends and family

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) for alerts.

#### Wet season

The wet season is from May to October.

Flooding may happen in the:

* Northern region
* Upper East region
* Upper West region

Roads can shut quickly, stranding travellers.

If you travel during the wet season or after a natural disaster, check if services at your planned destination have been affected.
