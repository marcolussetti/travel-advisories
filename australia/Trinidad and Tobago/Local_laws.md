# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They can include lengthy prison sentences in local jails, even for a small quantity of illegal drugs.

Research the local laws before you travel.

#### Other laws

Sodomy is a criminal offence punishable with a prison term of up to 5 years.

There are laws prohibiting LGBTQIA+ individuals from entering the country, but in practice these laws are rarely enforced.

Serious crimes, including murder and treason, can attract the death penalty.

Other illegal activities in Trinidad and Tobago include:

* public nudity in non-designated areas
* indecent language, such as swearing
* wearing army or police camouflage clothing as a civilian

Carrying ammunition when arriving, leaving or travelling through Trinidad and Tobago is also illegal. This includes bullets, bullet casings and spent ammunition.

You can sometimes find ammunition in decorative items, including jewellery and key rings. If you have these items on you at an airport, police may detain, charge or fine you.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
