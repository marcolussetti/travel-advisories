#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

You will need a visa to enter Trinidad and Tobago. Apply for your visa using the [E-Visa Online Portal](https://E-Visa%20Online%20Portal) at least 14 business days before your travel. Additional information can be found on the [Trinidad and Tobago Immigration Division's](https://Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20Immigration%20Division) website.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the high commission, embassy or consulate of Trinidad and Tobago for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Trinidad and Tobago doesn't have a high commission or consulate in Australia. Its nearest mission is the [Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in Beijing](https://foreign.gov.tt/missions-consuls/tt-missions-abroad/diplomatic-missions/embassy-beijing-china/), China.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Trinidad and Tobago Dollar (TTD).

You can exchange foreign currency for TTD at commercial banks and official exchange bureaus.

Most international hotels and tourist facilities accept credit and debit cards.

ATMs are widely available across the country. Criminals target ATMs, so take care when using one.

Ask your bank whether your ATM card will work in Trinidad and Tobago.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Trinidad and Tobago, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital drivers licences may not be accepted)
* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads
* local driving practices
* traffic congestion

High-speed accidents, particularly along the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway, often result in deaths.

Conditions on rural and mountain roads are particularly hazardous.

The road from Port of Spain to the popular Maracas beach area is dangerous. Road users often drive dangerously. The road is also:

* narrow and windy
* poorly maintained
* subject to landslides
* busy

Fatal accidents have been caused by erratic driving to and from Piarco International Airport.

Security risks along several routes increase, especially at night.

It's against the law to use mobile phones while driving, except in 'hands-free' or Bluetooth mode.

Police conduct random breath tests. They can also stop traffic if they suspect a person is driving under the influence of alcohol.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have adequate insurance
* carry vehicle insurance papers
* check local traffic laws and practices
* don't drive at night unless on major highways

Use the Airport Taxi Drivers' Cooperative services at the airport.

Crimes including rape, assault, robbery and theft have taken place in private cars and maxi taxis.

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport due to safety concerns.
