#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Trinidad and Tobago with the [Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Health - Chemistry Food and Drug Division](https://health.gov.tt/services/chemistry-food-and-drugs-division). Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

Take appropriate precautions if you take part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Trinidad and Tobago has a risk of zika virus transmission.

The Australian Department of Health's [zika virus bulletin](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) includes advice on how to minimise zika virus risks.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Trinidad and Tobago varies.

Costs at public hospitals range from free for general problems to expensive for complicated procedures.

Treatment at private hospitals can be expensive. You may have to pay in local currency before doctors treat you.

Tobago has one decompression chamber in Roxborough in the north of the island.

You might be evacuated to Miami or another destination if you're seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
