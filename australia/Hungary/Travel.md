#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Hungary is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter Hungary without a visa in some cases.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/89)or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/89/State)of Hungary for details about visas, currency, and customs. 

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/89)or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/89/State)of Hungary for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

Make sure you:

* check that the entry stamp in your passport is readable when you enter the [Schengen](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") area for the first time. Border officials may ask you to show them an onward or return ticket.
* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/visas).

You won't be allowed to enter if you have failed to pay a fine issued in Hungary. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/89)or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/89/State)of Hungary for advice on paying fines before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes. 

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place. 

If your passport is lost or stolen, you must tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Hungary is the Forint (HUF).

Euros may be accepted in major cities, and payment by card is widely accepted.

Most banks have ATMs that accept major international cards.

Check all banknotes received are valid. Some outdated notes are still in circulation.

Declare funds of more than 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Hungary and a non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not just cash. Failure to do so will result in fines.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive on your Australian driver's licence for 1 year if you also have either: 

* a Hungarian translation of your licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before your travel.

#### Road travel

Highways are usually in good condition.

Driving in rural areas can be dangerous due to poor road maintenance and lighting.

Snow tyres aren't mandatory in winter, but check with your insurer.

You must always keep car headlights on when driving outside of towns.

You need a motorway sticker (vignette) for your car to travel on motorways. You can buy vignette stickers at petrol stations and post offices or e-vignettes online. If buying an e-vignette, keep proof of purchase. 

Frequent automatic vignette checks occur. You'll be fined if you don't have one.

Driving with a blood alcohol reading above 0% is a severe offence. Police can take your licence away if you're driving under the influence of alcohol. Other penalties can also be imposed, including jail time.

Heavy fines exist for minor traffic offences. 

Police can keep your passport if you dispute a driving fine or offence. They will issue a receipt and a letter asking you to report to a police station. The passport will be returned once the dispute is settled.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer to ensure that your policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike, or similar.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Some taxi drivers get commissions to take passengers to bars, clubs and restaurants. 

Never ask a taxi driver to recommend a bar, club or restaurant. Call a dispatcher instead of hailing one on the street. 

Check that the meter is running and that the charge is correct. If you think you've been overcharged, ask for a receipt and contact the taxi company. 

#### Public transport

Hungary has a well-developed and reliable public transportation system. This includes trains that run to all major towns. Take care of your personal belongings, particularly on trains and in major transport hubs. Don't leave bags unattended on trains, even briefly.

You'll be fined if you travel on public transport without a ticket.

To avoid a fine:

* follow all passenger notices (usually printed in English)
* validate your ticket before starting your journey
* keep your ticket until the end of your journey
* show your ticket to inspectors if asked
