## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel from Hungary to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. The security situation continues to be volatile.
* Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, tourist areas, Christmas markets, shopping areas, transport hubs, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, theft from vehicles and highway robberies can happen. Be careful on public transport, in tourist areas, petrol stations and highway parking areas. Use secure parking facilities.
* Bars and restaurants can overcharge travellers. Disputes about overcharging can lead to violence. Always check menu prices before ordering.
* Drink spiking can occur at popular nightclubs and at festivals, often leading to [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

### Health

* Medical treatment is adequate, but many facilities are below Australian standards, and facilities are limited in rural and border areas. Hospitals and doctors may require payment upfront before they will treat you.
* Take care in forests and rural areas where ticks can carry encephalitis. Ticks are active from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks and remove them as soon as possible.

### Local laws

* Always carry your ID.
* Smoking is banned in most places. Although inconsistently enforced, large fines can apply.

### Travel

* Hungary is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This means that, in some cases, you can enter Hungary without a visa. Otherwise, you'll need to get a visa before you travel.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/89) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/89/State) of Hungary for the latest details.
