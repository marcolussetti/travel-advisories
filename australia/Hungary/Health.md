#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave and read the [fine print](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/dont-let-a-mistake-end-in-misfortune). 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

You may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care if you're not insured.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. 

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Hungary. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating the following:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) is a risk in forested and rural areas. They're active from spring to autumn. Although rare, [West Nile virus](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) cases have occurred in Hungary. There's no vaccine for it.

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

To reduce your risk of tick-borne disease:

* check your body for ticks during and after visiting forests
* remove ticks as soon as possible, making sure to remove the whole tick
* monitor the tick site for signs of infection

#### Other health risks

Outbreaks of foodborne and other infectious diseases can occur. These include:

* [Hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)

To reduce your risk of illness:

* practice good hygiene
* avoid contaminated food or water
* make sure your vaccinations are up to date

#### Medical care

Medical treatment is adequate, but hospitals vary in quality. Many medical facilities are below the standard of Australia. They have limited nursing care. Friends and relatives are often required to give around-the-clock care.

You're expected to bring your own necessities, including hygiene items (towels, toilet paper), cutlery and bottled water. 

Medical facilities can be limited in rural and border areas.  
There's no private in-patient hospital facility in Budapest.

Some doctors speak English, but it's not widely spoken by other hospital staff.

Doctors and public hospitals may expect up-front cash payment for services. Medical care can be very expensive. Make sure you have travel insurance before you arrive.
