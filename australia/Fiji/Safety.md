# Safety

#### Crime

Crime that occurs in Fiji includes:

* robbery
* theft
* violent assault, including sexual assault
* home invasions

Most crime is opportunistic and is exacerbated by cost of living pressures in local communities.

You're most at risk in urban areas and at night, including popular tourist areas located in and around Suva and Nadi.

Be careful when visiting tourist attractions, including Colo-i-Suva, and other parks and nature trails. Be aware of your surroundings and keep your personal belongings secure.

Credit card fraud and use of skimming devices occurs.

To reduce your risk of becoming a victim:

* keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* keep bags and valuables out of sight in vehicles
* don't carry excess cash and jewellery
* protect your PIN and be alert when using ATMs
* check through your credit card and bank statements for fraud
* where possible, use ATMs where a security guard is present

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fwhile-youre-away%2Fwhen-things-go-wrong%2Fmedical-assistance&data=05%7C02%7CGlobalWatchOffice%40dfat.gov.au%7C9e1fe8405acd4aca988a08dd1cbc0dd6%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638698316229629235%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=QyWh5i87yqXEQghTVCGmoOYc6rsLspeOk6Lo%2FdBXtKI%3D&reserved=0) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Sexual assault

If you're a victim/survivor of [sexual assault](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fwhile-youre-away%2Fcrime%2Fsexual-assault-overseas&data=05%7C02%7CMichelle.Lam%40dfat.gov.au%7C6e4eef2e6048438f7e4b08dcf30d55db%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638652485841166989%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ab7mjg3uDSJwV3TIEjZc3SZdz6E6DFzAy2WrkOHZtw0%3D&reserved=0), you may need urgent medical care. You may also want to report the crime to local police. You can call the Australian High Commission in Fiji for advice and consular assistance in seeking medical care and contacting police (see '[Local contacts](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fdestinations%2Fpacific%2Ffiji%23local-contacts&data=05%7C02%7CMichelle.Lam%40dfat.gov.au%7C6e4eef2e6048438f7e4b08dcf30d55db%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638652485841178881%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uRocAzjA%2BLls0ESat5zKZCpwwvH%2BR1tg9%2BqsuFZ7WuI%3D&reserved=0)').

If you choose to report the assault, go to the local police station in person to make a statement (you may wish to seek consular assistance before you visit). Statements from you and witnesses can be used as evidence in criminal court proceedings.

Police will usually start to investigate while you're in Fiji. In most cases, you need to be in Fiji for the trial.

You may want to talk about what happened and get help from an experienced counsellor. If you need to speak to a counsellor:

* call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305
* contact the Australian High Commission in Fiji.

They can connect you to counselling hotlines and services.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Avoid any protests, demonstrations, rallies, public gatherings and areas with military activity.

Although rare, public protests and events that draw large groups can turn violent.

Follow the instructions of local authorities and monitor the media for updates.

Local authorities sometimes erect checkpoints and close roads. Follow their advice.

**More information:**

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

* earthquakes and tsunamis

Severe weather may affect regional sea ports.

In the event of severe weather or a natural disaster:

#### Cyclones

November to April is cyclone season, but cyclones may occur at other times.

A tropical cyclone's direction and strength can change quickly.

During and after a cyclone:

* adequate shelter may not be available
* flights from and to affected areas can be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly

If a cyclone is approaching, find your local shelter. In some areas, it may be hard to find sturdy cover. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Flooding

Flooding is common in Fiji, especially in downtown Nadi and on the Coral Coast.

Flooding and landslides can disrupt infrastructure and essential services.

Floods can cut off road access, including access to the airport.

Monitor road closures on the [Fiji Roads Authority Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fijiroads/).

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur in Fiji.

Be alert to warnings. A tsunami can happen within minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake.

If authorities issue a tsunami warning (by siren and/or news announcements), check with your accommodation provider about evacuation plans.

Move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media and follow local authorities' advice.
