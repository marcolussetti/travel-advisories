#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Tourist visas

If you’re travelling from [certain countries](https://immigration.gov.fj/visa-exempted-countries/), including Australia, you don't need a tourist visa for Fiji. If your stay is less than 4 months, authorities will issue a visa when you arrive.

To get a visa on arrival, you must show proof of booked accommodation and a return ticket.

Before travelling to Fiji, check Tourism Fiji's [Frequently asked questions about travelling to Fiji](https://www.fiji.travel/faqs) page. If you have a previous criminal record, you may be denied entry into Fiji. 

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Fiji for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other visas

You may need a visa if you travel for other reasons. Contact the Fiji High Commission for more details.

* [Fiji Department of Immigration](https://www.immigration.gov.fj/)

#### Customs

Strict customs rules apply for importing items, such as:

* food
* weapons
* sexually explicit material

More information:

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, let the Australian Government know as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)

If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Fiji Dollar (FJD). ATMs are common in urban areas and large resorts. Carry cash when you travel to villages or remote areas. Local banks and ATMs will charge fees for cash withdrawals.

Not all retail outlets will accept credit cards. Those that do will charge a fee between 2-5%.

You can easily exchange Australian dollars for FJD.

You must declare:

* amounts of more than FJD5,000 (or equivalent) when you arrive in Fiji
* amounts of more than FJD10,000 (or equivalent) when you leave

This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

#### Local travel

[Severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident) can affect tourist services, including roads and flights in and out of Fiji.

#### Local restrictions

Monitor the Fijian Government [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FijiGovernment) for information and updates about any restrictions or curfew hours.

#### Tourism services or products

Transport and tour operators may not follow safety precautions. They may also not maintain their equipment to the standards you'd expect.

This includes operators of:

* adventure activities such as scuba diving, snorkelling, rafting and skydiving
* boats in rivers, coastal waters and between islands

Sometimes boats, rafts and kayaks don't have enough life jackets.

If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check that your insurance policy covers the activity
* before booking, check the operator's safety history and their safety equipment
* use only well-known and registered operators
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use the safety equipment, even if others don't

If you aren't given safety gear, or it's not in usable condition, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

Always carry your Australian driver's licence.

You can hire vehicles and drive in Fiji using your Australian driver's licence for the first 6 months after your arrival.  After that, you'll need to apply for a Fijian driver's licence at a local Land Transport Authority office.

If you want to ride a motorbike, check if your licence and insurance covers you for this. Driving without the correct licence can void your insurance.

If you want to drive a boat, check if your licence covers you for this.

#### Road travel

If you drive in Fiji, take care. Driving is most risky at night due to:

* poor street lighting
* stray animals
* poor road quality

More information:

* [Driving or riding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety)

#### Taxis

Taxi quality varies.  
  
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) licenses taxis.  
  
Only use licensed taxis, which have yellow registration plates. Look out for the LT or LH registrations on the license plate. LT plates are metered taxis. LH taxis have fixed distance rates.   
  
Before you catch a taxi, make sure you have cash (Fiji dollars) for payments and that their meter is turned on. Be aware some taxis only have a seatbelt in the front passenger seat. You may need to plan ahead to book a taxi with front and rear seatbelts.

#### Public transport

The LTA licenses some, but not all, minibuses. Unlicensed minibuses may not have insurance.

Only use those with yellow number plates that have been LTA-approved.

#### Sea travel

Before boarding any boat or ship, check the operator's credentials and safety equipment.

Make sure your insurance policy covers you for sea travel.

Don't travel on a sea vessel that is over capacity.
