#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Fiji. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Always carry your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

Authorities may arrest you or confiscate restricted medication if you don't have the right documents.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical care standards in Fiji aren't as high as in Australia and are limited.

Hospitals and medical facilities can lack:

* extra services
* specialist equipment, including neonatal
* diagnostic equipment
* infection prevention control measures
* pharmaceuticals

Many hospitals provide only basic care.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria outbreaks can occur in health facilities in Fiji. 

#### Medical emergencies

Rescue and emergency services aren't as wide-ranging as they are in Australia.

Ambulance services are limited. Adverse weather and road conditions may affect your ability to access medical services.

In medical emergencies, hotels and resorts use public health facilities.

Before they admit patients, hospitals usually need:

* a payment guarantee
* confirmed medical insurance
* an up-front deposit

If you become seriously ill or have an accident, you may need to be evacuated to Australia. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

Fiji has two hyperbaric (decompression) chambers located at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva and the Pacific Specialist Healthcare in Nadi.

You should dive well within safety limits.

Make sure your travel and health insurance covers you for diving-related costs and for medical evacuation.
