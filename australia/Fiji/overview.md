## Overview

### Safety

* Crime in Fiji includes robbery, theft, violent assault, sexual assault and home invasions. Most crime is opportunistic. The highest risk is in urban areas and at night. Be careful in popular tourist areas located in and around Suva and Nadi.
* Credit card fraud and ATM card skimming occur. Protect your PIN and be alert when using ATMs. Regularly check your card and bank statements for fraud.
* Avoid protests, street rallies and areas with military activity. Protests can occur with little warning and can turn violent. Local authorities sometimes set up checkpoints and close roads. Follow their advice and monitor media for updates.
* November to April is cyclone season, but cyclones may occur at other times. They can cause flooding and disrupt essential services. Know your accommodation’s evacuation plan. If a cyclone is approaching, find your nearest shelter and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Flooding is common, especially in downtown Nadi and on the Coral Coast. Floods can cut off road access, including to the airport. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks and don't leave food or drinks unattended.  See [Partying safely while overseas](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fsafety%2Fpartying&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C610451ff5b984b89badf08dda48e9be4%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638847654600294288%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=p8DJb%2BodNSK9GTZjmaOeXPWYl9mJ%2Fop6i4%2BMhJoSfmc%3D&reserved=0)

### Health

* Protect yourself against illness, drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids, avoid ice cubes and avoid raw and undercooked foods. Be particularly careful during and after heavy rain and flooding.
* Fiji has two hyperbaric (decompression) chambers located in Suva and Nadi. If you're diving, stay well within safety limits.
* There are risks of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue fever, Chikungunya and Zika virus. Protect yourself against mosquito bites.
* Cases of leptospirosis and typhoid occur. Stay away from flooded rivers or creeks. Wear footwear when outside.
* The Fiji Government has declared a HIV outbreak. Take precautions if you’re doing anything that exposes you to the risk of sexually transmitted infections.
* Medical care standards in Fiji aren't as high as in Australia and are limited. Medical facilities often lack services, equipment and drugs, and have issues with infection prevention control. You may have to pay up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you’ll need medical evacuation to Australia.
* Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date. Monitor the [Ministry of Health and Medical Services](http://www.health.gov.fj/) website and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MHMSFiji/) page for information and updates.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties include prison sentences, even for possessing small amounts of drugs.
* Fiji recognises dual nationality. Always travel on your Australian passport. If you're a dual national and you're arrested or detained, ask to contact the Australian High Commission.
* Outside of tourist areas, Fiji's dress standards are conservative. Take care not to offend.
* Same-sex relationships are legal, but some locals don't accept them. Consider limiting public displays of affection, especially in rural areas.
