# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Understand local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Court proceedings can go on for a long time. The Australian Government can't influence the time this takes.

The police and military have detention, arrest and search powers.

#### Drugs

You can go to jail for possession of any quantity of illegal drugs. This includes if you are:

* Carrying or using drugs
* Partying safely with drugs

#### Drunk and disorderly

You can be arrested for being drunk and disorderly, including while youâ€™re at an airport or on a plane. You can be fined and detained if you cause damage to property or assault others, including first responders.

#### Abortion

Abortion in Fiji is only legal in certain circumstances. Research local laws and consult your doctor before making any decisions about your medical care.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Fiji recognises dual nationality. Always travel on your Australian passport.

If you're a dual national and authorities arrest or detain you, ask to contact the Australian High Commission.

However, we may only be able to assist you in exceptional circumstances.

#### Local customs

Outside of tourist areas, the dress code in Fiji is conservative. Dress respectfully when visiting village areas.

Same-sex relationships are legal, but some locals have conservative attitudes towards them. Open displays of affection could offend locals, particularly in rural areas.

Take care not to offend.
