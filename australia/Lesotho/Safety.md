# Safety

#### Crime

Police resources are varied throughout Lesotho.

Common crimes, especially in Maseru, include:

* [muggings and armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [carjacking](/node/344)
* [petty theft](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [pickpocketing](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")

Gun-related crimes and break-ins have targeted travellers.

Security risks increase at night and on weekends.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid walking alone or at night
* always keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* use ATMs in controlled areas such as banks, shops and shopping centres
* always keep your credit card in sight when paying bills at restaurants and shops

If you are the victim of crime, particularly sexual assault, you may not receive the same standard of care or understanding as you would in Australia. Please contact the Consular Emergency Centre or the Australian High Commission in Pretoria for assistance.

Lesotho has high rates of HIV/AIDS. If you think you are at risk of infection, seek immediate medical help. Consult your travel insurance about appropriate medical care.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
