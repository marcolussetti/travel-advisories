#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Tourists can visit Lesotho for up to 30 days without a visa. If you intend to stay longer than 30 days, you can apply for an extension, which must be done within the first 14 days of entry. For other situations, you'll need to apply for a visa in advance. While visas are no longer required, border processes are still done at road and air entry points. 

#### Border measures

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Display) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Lesotho if you travel from a country where yellow fever occurs.

#### Travel via South Africa

There are limited flight options to and from [South Africa](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/south-africa). Contact your travel provider for details. If you're travelling through South Africa, you must meet its entry and transit requirements.

Travelling from South Africa to Lesotho by road can be dangerous due the road conditions, including potholes and the routes are heavily used by cargo trucks.  

South Africa has specific documentation requirements for [children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children").

South Africa doesn't accept [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents).

You may need a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter South Africa.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

Lesotho requires your passport to be valid for six months from the date you plan to leave the country. You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months or does not have two blank pages.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
