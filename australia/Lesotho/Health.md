#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation: the Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Lesotho. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Pharmaceutical products may be in short supply in Lesotho.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medications is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is very high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Lesotho are basic.

You may need to travel to other regions to access health care, including facilities in Bloemfontein, South Africa, which is 140km from Maseru.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a major centre in South Africa or another place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
