# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Ask police or prison officials to contact the [Australian High Commission in Pretoria, South Africa](https://southafrica.highcommission.gov.au/pret/contact-us.html) if you're arrested or detained.

Police resources are varied throughout Lesotho.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences.

Serious crimes, such as murder and sexual assault, can attract the death penalty.

It's illegal to take photos around military or government buildings.

Same-sex relationships are illegal.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Lesotho doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.
