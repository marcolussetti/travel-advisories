# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties are severe for drug-related offences. You may face a minimum mandatory jail term.

#### Other laws

The legal drinking age is 21 years.

Counterfeit and pirated goods are widely available. Buying, selling or owning these goods is illegal.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when youâ€™re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The US recognises dual nationality.

If you're an Australian-US dual citizen, you must:

* travel with both passports
* use your US passport to enter and exit the US, including Guam

Check the US Department of State's [Bureau of Consular Affairs](http://travel.state.gov/) for advice before you travel.
