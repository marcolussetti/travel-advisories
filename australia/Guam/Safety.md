# Safety

#### Crime

Petty crime occurs in Guam, including drug- and alcohol-related crime.

Use common sense, as you would in Australia.

To protect yourself from theft:

* be aware of your personal safety
* protect your valuables, don't leave them in a parked car or unattended at the beach.
* don't buy or accept counterfeit goods

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.
