#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Guam is an unincorporated US territory. You must meet US entry or transit requirements.

Australia is a participating country of the visa waiver program which allows Australians to travel to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days without a visa. Travellers must complete U.S. Customs and Border Protection form I-736 to enter Guam without a visa. More information is available from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program-requirements).

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the nearest [US embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/212/State) for details about visas, entry requirements, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

**More information:**

* [Embassy of the United States of America in Australia](https://au.usembassy.gov/visas/)

#### Border Measures

Entry requirements for Guam are the same as for any destination in the US.

Before entering Guam, you'll need to complete a [mandatory electronic declaration form](https://guamedf.landing.cards/), accessible 72 hours prior to departure.

Check with your airline or tour operator to confirm you meet all entry requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Baggage locks

The locks on your airline baggage must meet US requirements.

**More information:**

* [Transportation Security Administration](https://www.tsa.gov/)

#### Arriving by sea

All yachts must clear customs and immigration at Apra Harbour.

Contact [US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)](https://www.cbp.gov/) well before you enter the harbour. Call:

* +671 642 7611 (seaport)

You'll pay a fee if you arrive by sea after 5pm or on a weekend.

#### Travelling with children

If you're [travelling with a child](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/who-you-are/children), carry evidence of your relationship.

If you're the sole parent travelling with your child, you'll need [a notarised letter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/notarial-services). You'll also need one if you're travelling with a child who isn't yours. This letter needs to include:

* consent signed by the non-travelling parents or guardians
* details on who the child can travel with
* the dates and places of travel

Some airlines don't allow children to travel alone. Ask your airline if unaccompanied children are allowed on flights to, from, or that transit in Guam.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Your passport must have at least 6 months remaining validity from the date of entry to Guam or you will be refused entry.

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If you lose your passport or it's stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
