#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may be illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Guam. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect proof

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Public medical facilities generally don't meet Australian standards. Private medical facilities meet Australian standards.

Medical costs are expensive. A visit to the doctor for a minor complaint may cost hundreds of dollars.

You'll need to prove you're able to pay for services or have valid health insurance. If you can't provide proof, you'll need to pay up-front.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. You may also be delayed by the limited number of flights out of Guam.

There are 2 decompression chambers of a high standard at [Guam Regional Medical City](https://www.themedicalcity.com/our-network/guam-regional-medical-city).
