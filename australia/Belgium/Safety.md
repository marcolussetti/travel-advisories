#### Terrorism

Following a terrorist attack in 2023, the threat level for Belgium, including Brussels, is now level 3 of 4, meaning there's a possible and imminent threat. (A threat level of 3 is identified as 'Serious' by the Belgian Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis.)

Brussels hosts several international institutions (EU and NATO) and government and foreign embassy buildings, which are sensitive locations. 

There have been high-profile terrorist attacks across Belgium. Previous incidents include attacks against civilians and security forces:

* October 2023 – 2 people were shot and killed in Brussels.
* Nov 2022 - a police officer was killed and another injured in a suspected terrorist incident in Brussels.
* May 2018 – 2 police officers and a passer-by were killed in a shooting in Liege in a suspected terrorist incident.
* June 2017 — a failed attack at Brussels central train station
* March 2016 — attacks at Brussels National Airport, Zaventem and Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station — 32 people killed and 300 injured.

More attacks could happen at any time.

Expect heightened security measures, including:

* an increased police presence
* increased caution and scrutiny from security forces
* potential added security measures in certain places

Crowded places may be the target of an attack, such as:

* tourist areas
* shopping areas
* train stations
* airports
* public transport
* places of worship
* concerts, music events and festivals
* major sporting events

Belgian authorities have successfully disrupted various attack plans, and Belgian police continue to conduct anti-terror operations. These could occur with little or no warning.

If you're in the area of a police operation:

* follow the instructions and advice of local authorities
* stay indoors and close windows and blinds, if possible

Extra security arrangements are in place at the Australian Embassy in Brussels. Visitors must pass a security screening. Don't bring your luggage with you.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* report anything suspicious to the police
* monitor official and media sources for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Public Alert System

The Belgian Government provides information in the case of emergencies through the [Belgian Crisis Centre](https://centredecrise.be/fr) (available in French, Dutch or German) and social media ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CrisiscenterBE/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crisiscenterBE)). You can also register to be notified in an emergency through the Belgian Public Alert System ([Be-Alert](https://www.be-alert.be/en/)).

#### Crime

Crimes such as theft, [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), pickpocketing, and bag snatching are common in urban and tourist areas. Theft on board intercity and international trains is also common.

Hotspots for crime include the popular tourist spots in:

* Brussels
* Antwerp
* Bruges
* Ghent

Pickpockets also target passengers in transportation hubs such as the Metro, train stations and airports.

Incidents of petty crime on trains along the Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and Brussels-London routes are frequent.

Thieves often work in teams of 2 or 3. They distract victims by:

* asking you a question
* spilling food or drink
* telling you someone has spilt something on your clothes

To stay safe from crime:

* take care in transport hubs, tourist areas and some inner-city areas, especially at night
* seek local advice about the safety of certain areas
* take care of your belongings on trains, in public transport and at major train stations, particularly at Gare du Midi/Zuidstation (South Station), Gare de Bruxelles-Nord/Noordstation (North Station) and Gare De Bruxelles-Centrale/Centraalstation (Central Station)
* carry your travel documents while travelling
* avoid walking alone after dark or in isolated areas.

In the event of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report.

There has been an increase in violence, including stabbings and shootings, linked to the drug trade in Brussels and other major cities.

In February, shootings occurred in the commune of Brussels, in the Marolles neighbourhood, and around the following locations in the commune Saint-Gilles:

* Port-de-Hal
* Gare du Midi
* Place Jacques Franck

If you're in Brussels:

* be aware of your surroundings
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* expect a heightened police presence in certain areas

#### **Cyber security**

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and strike action often occur in transport hubs, cities, and the Schuman area of Brussels. While most demonstrations are peaceful, there is a risk of isolated incidents of unrest or violence. 

Demonstrations are common, often directed at:

* embassies
* European Union institutions
* NATO

Belgium often hosts large international meetings. Heads of state, senior government and business figures may attend.

Before and during these meetings, authorities often increase security measures around Brussels or other parts of Belgium. This may disrupt travel.

To avoid issues:

* follow the instructions of local authorities or security staff
* monitor local media for updates on possible unrest
* avoid affected areas

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can affect your travel. Monitor local media for updates.

If you plan to visit an affected area:

* confirm your plans with your tour operator or travel provider
* check conditions with local tour operators and hotels
