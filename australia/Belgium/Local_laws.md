# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Laws relating to drugs are similar to those of Australia. Possession of drugs and trafficking of drugs are serious offences.

#### Other laws

You must carry your passport or a Belgian government-issued ID at all times.

It's illegal to wear clothing that largely or completely hides your face in public places (parks, buildings, public transport, on the street). Wearing such clothing risks a fine and/or detention for up to 7 days. There's no exemption for tourists.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
