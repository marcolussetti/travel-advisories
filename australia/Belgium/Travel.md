#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

Belgium is a part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries, meaning you can enter Belgium without a visa in some cases.

In other situations, get a visa before you travel.

Always carry your passport when you cross borders, even in the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Belgium has introduced additional entry checks until December 2025. Checks may be carried out on major roads leading into Belgium, motorway car parks, international bus and train services and intra-Schengen flights. This may involve verifying travel documents, identification and screening for illegal substances. In Belgium, you must carry your passport with you at all times.

There are temporary border controls in place to travel into France and Germany from Belgium. Check the entry requirements for [France](/destinations/europe/france "France"), [Germany](/destinations/europe/germany "Germany") and [the Netherlands](/node/385) before you travel.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

Increased security measures are in force at international airports and train stations.

Carry your passport when you enter or exit Belgium, even by road or rail.

Contact your airline or travel agent for updates or check-in requirements.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

Also, go to the nearest police station to:

* report the crime
* get a declaration of theft

This may be useful for any insurance claims.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Belgium's currency is the Euro.

ATMs are widely available.

If you're travelling between Belgium and a non-EU country, declare currency of 10,000 euros or more or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll be fined if you don't declare currency or give incorrect information on entry or exit.

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive a vehicle, you'll need both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

Car rental companies may require both documents.

You must be at least 18 years old to drive in Belgium.

If you register as a resident with a local commune, you'll need to change your Australian driver's licence for a Belgian licence.

Communes usually require the date of issue of your Australian licence. If your licence doesn't show this, contact your state or territory licensing authority for an official notice stating the issue date.

#### Road travel

Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the country. The 'priority to the right' system is in effect in Belgium.

Drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from the right at intersections. This is often a surprise to foreign drivers and results in accidents.

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

Check that your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use licensed, official taxis. [Assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") have occurred in unlicensed taxis.

Targets for unlicensed taxis include high-traffic destinations, such as:

* airports
* train stations
* other tourist locations

Rideshare options are available. Taxis can be booked via the Uber app.

#### Public transport

Pickpockets operate on intercity and international trains.

Pay close attention to valuables and your passport on trains and other forms of public transport.

Check [Belgian Rail](http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx) for bookings and any service interruptions.

#### National strike action

Strike action is an ongoing issue that can cause severe travel disruption across the country and affect international travel. Strikes may be announced at short notice, and planned strikes may be extended at short notice. They can also coincide with demonstrations and protests.

For regular updates on any disruption, check local news and follow the advice given by your travel provider. If you are in areas where large gatherings are taking place, remain vigilant and move away quickly if there are signs of disorder. Avoid protests, expect delays on some major roads and follow the advice of the authorities.

#### Electric scooter regulations

The maximum speed limit for riding an electric scooter is 25km/h, and riding with a passenger is illegal.

It's illegal for people aged 15 and under to use electric scooters, except in a few designated areas such as pedestrianised, private residential and recreational areas, and segregated cycle paths.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

See [Belgium's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=OO) with the Aviation Safety Network.
