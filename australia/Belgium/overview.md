## Overview

### Safety

* Belgium's [national threat level](https://cuta.belgium.be/) is set at 'serious' – level 3 of 4. There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Belgium. Terrorists have staged attacks and may plan more. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, tourist areas, shopping areas, transport hubs, places of worship, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, such as mugging, pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs. Thieves often try to distract you. Take care of your belongings and passports, particularly at tourist spots, on public transport, train stations and other crowded areas.
* Demonstrations are common. Belgium hosts large international meetings. Increased security can disrupt transport. Avoid affected areas.

### Health

* Medical care and facility standards are similar to those in Australia.
* Australia has a [reciprocal health care agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreement-visiting-belgium?context=22481) with Belgium. You can get treated in public medical facilities but still need travel insurance. If you're staying in Belgium for more than 1 year, you should register with a Belgian health insurance fund.
