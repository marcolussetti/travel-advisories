## Overview

### Safety

* The threat level for Belgium, including Brussels, remains at level 3 of 4, meaning there's a possible and imminent threat. (A threat level of 3 is identified as 'Serious' by the Belgian Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis).
* There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Belgium. Terrorists have staged attacks and may plan more. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, tourist areas, shopping areas, transport hubs, places of worship, major sporting events and other public areas, are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, such as mugging, pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs. Thieves often try to distract you. Take care of your belongings and passports, particularly at tourist spots, on public transport, train stations and other crowded areas.
* Demonstrations are common. Belgium hosts large international meetings. Increased security can disrupt transport. Avoid affected areas.
