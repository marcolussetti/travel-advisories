#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Belgium. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Measles

There have been outbreaks of measles in Belgium. Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel.

Other health risks in Belgium are broadly similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is high.

Belgium and Australia have a [reciprocal healthcare agreement](http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/medicare/reciprocal-health-care-agreements). You can get subsidised treatment in the Belgian public health system, including:

* hospital
* medical care
* prescription drugs

To access the reciprocal health care agreement, you must present your:

* valid Medicare card
* current Australian passport or evidence that you're an Australian permanent resident

You may need to pay at the time of treatment and get reimbursed from a Belgian health insurance fund ('mutuelle').

The reciprocal health care agreement does not cover treatment in:

* private medical facilities
* public facilities as a private patient

If you're a private patient, you must pay for any treatment, services or medication you receive.

The reciprocal health care agreement doesn't replace the need for travel insurance.
