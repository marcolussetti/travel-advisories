#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Under local law, you must provide proof of adequate travel insurance to cover the full period of your stay, including coverage for a medivac if required.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Djibouti. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs through the year. Other diseases spread by insects are a risk, including:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medication to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Polio

Outbreaks of [polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) happen in Djibouti.

Check your polio vaccination status with your doctor or travel clinic at least 8 weeks before you travel.

If you aren't vaccinated, complete the full course of vaccinations before you leave.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is widespread. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Other infectious diseases

Foodborne, waterborne and other [infectious diseases](/node/348) are common. These include:

* African Tick bite fever
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/health-topics/chikungunya/#tab=tab_1)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To avoid illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids in rural areas
* avoid ice cubes in rural areas
* avoid raw and undercooked food
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs and other animals

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Dehydration and heat stroke

High summer temperatures can cause dehydration and heat stroke.

In extreme heat, stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Djibouti is poor. Rural areas may have very basic care or none at all. English-speaking staff may not be available.

Payment for medical treatment is required upfront. Your treatment may be delayed if you can’t pay.

Availability of medication in rural areas is limited and can be expensive.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel insurance, including for medical evacuation.
