## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorists are likely to attempt attacks in Djibouti. Al-Shabaab maintains a strong interest in attacking targets in Djibouti. Public places, tourist areas, places of worship, embassies and airports are potential terrorist targets. Check for security warnings before you visit potential targets and be alert in these locations. Monitor the media for new threats and follow the instructions of local authorities.
* Djibouti's borders with Eritrea and Somalia are at high risk. If, despite our advice, you travel to these areas, get professional security advice.
* [Pirate attacks](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) and other maritime attacks are a serious threat. Pirates have attacked vessels, including commercial vessels, and held foreigner's hostage for ransom in and around Djibouti's waters and the Gulf of Aden.
* Regional conflict can cause civil unrest. Public gatherings can turn violent. Avoid protests.
* Petty crime occurs. Risks increase at night and in isolated locations. Be vigilant and avoid walking alone after dark.
* Bandit groups operate in lawless areas outside the capital. Only drive outside the capital during daylight hours and in a convoy.
* From May to October, Djibouti can experience dust storms and temperatures over 50°C. Be prepared for impacts to essential services, including food and water availability.

### Health

* Medical facilities in Djibouti are limited. Make sure you have adequate travel insurance including coverage for a medivac if required.
* Insect-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue and filariasis are prevalent. Use insect repellent. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Polio outbreaks happen in Djibouti. If you aren't vaccinated, complete the full course of vaccinations before you travel.
* HIV/AIDS is widespread. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Djibouti's high temperatures can cause dehydration and heat stroke. Drink plenty of water.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe.
* Understand and follow local laws. Hunting, being drunk in public, consuming alcohol other than in authorised locations and photographing infrastructure or military personnel are illegal.
* Follow local customs. Djibouti is a mostly Muslim country. Dress conservatively and respect religious and social traditions.
* Same-sex relationships are not illegal, but authorities may prosecute same-sex couples displaying affection in public.
* The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/node/351) is one of Djibouti's most important religious dates. Don't eat, drink or smoke in public during the month of Ramadan.

### Travel

* You need a visa to visit Djibouti. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Djibouti for the latest details.
* You can exchange USD at major banks. Credit cards aren't widely accepted outside major hotels and supermarket chains. There are few ATMs and they often don't work. Have several ways to access money.
* Remote areas aren't safe. Don't travel within 10 km of the borders with Somalia or Eritrea. Avoid other remote areas. Remain on sealed roads. Landmines have been identified and marked, but haven't been removed.
* Due to military activity in the Bab-el-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea, and the increased risk of piracy in Djibouti's coastal waters and the Gulf of Aden, you should limit unnecessary travel to these areas. Check the [International Maritime Bureau's piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/) if you're planning boat travel and follow the advice of local authorities.

* To stay up to date with local information, follow the Embassy’s social media accounts.
