# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

While the consumption of alcohol is legal, the sale and consumption of alcohol in all but approved locations (such as hotels) is illegal. Public intoxication is illegal and includes a penalty of up to two years imprisonment.

Photography of military installations and public infrastructure is forbidden.  

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long jail sentences and heavy fines.
