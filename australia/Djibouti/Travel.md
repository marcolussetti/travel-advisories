#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You need a visa to visit Djibouti. Check the [official e-visa portal](https://www.evisa.gouv.dj/#/) for information.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Embassy of Djibouti](https://djiboutiembassy.jp/) in Tokyo for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

To enter Djibouti, you may be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination.

If you're arriving from a yellow fever-prone country, you will need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Djibouti.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of your arrival to enter Djibouti.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the entry rule inconsistently. It can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Djibouti Franc (DJF).

Traveller's cheques can be exchanged at major banks.

Djibouti has a cash-based economy. Credit cards aren't widely accepted. USD can be changed at major hotels and some banks.

There are a limited number of ATMs, but they often don't work.

Ask your bank if your card will work in Djibouti.

#### Local travel

#### Telecommunications

Communications networks are limited in the city of Djibouti. Outside the capital, mobile coverage is often unavailable or non-existent. Consider getting a local SIM. You will need to present your passport to purchase a local SIM.

#### Landmines

Djibouti is a 'mine-safe' country. This means landmines have been identified and marked, but haven't been removed.

For your safety, remain on paved roads, especially in:

* northern districts of Tadjoura and Obock
* southern district of Ali Sabieh

#### Remote areas

Security is limited in remote areas, including regions bordering Ethiopia and Somalia.

You need permission from the Government of Djibouti to travel above the 12° north latitude line, which passes through Obock.

Avoid travel to remote areas.

#### Essential services

Djibouti is one of the world's most arid countries experiencing severe drought. In some areas, the drought may affect:

* local services
* water availability
* basic food availability

#### Driving permit

To drive in Djibouti, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver’s licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Conditions on roads are unsafe, especially in central Djibouti and the Ethiopia-Djibouti border.

Hazards include:

* narrow or poorly lit roads
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* poorly managed traffic
* inadequate signs at railway crossings
* roaming livestock, especially at night

The standard of driving and vehicle maintenance is poor. Exercise caution at intersections; drivers often run red lights and do not stop at intersections. Avoid driving outside the city, especially to the north and Abbey Lake.

Police have set up wire coils as roadblocks on some major roads, which can be difficult to see at night.

In an accident, drivers must wait at the scene until police arrive.

Bandit groups are a threat outside the capital.

Before you drive:

* check you have adequate insurance
* check local traffic laws and practices
* check local information on road conditions, including security risks

To reduce your risks while driving:

* before embarking on long drives, get enough fuel
* only drive outside the capital during daylight hours and in a convoy
* be alert to hazards, especially at night
* don't drink and drive

Use a reputable car rental company or hotel transport provider.
