#### Terrorism

Terrorists are likely to try attempt attacks in Djibouti. The terrorist organisation, Al-Shabaab, maintains a strong interest in attacking targets in Djibouti.

A terrorist attack could happen anywhere and at any time. Terrorists may attack Djiboutian or western targets, including travellers.

Terrorist methods could include:

* suicide bombings
* [kidnappings](/node/57)
* roadside improvised explosive device (IED) attacks

There is a high threat of kidnapping within 10 km of Djibouti's border with Somalia (Somaliland).

Possible terrorist targets include:

* hotels, clubs, restaurants, and bars
* schools
* places of worship
* embassies
* outdoor recreation events
* markets, shopping areas, tourist areas and historic sites
* public transportation
* foreign military bases, airports, aircraft and military interests

Check the level of security if you're visiting a known target. To reduce your risk:

* be alert in locations that are known terrorist targets
* be alert to possible threats, especially in public
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow instructions from local authorities

Report any suspicious activity or items to local police.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest and armed conflict in Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea could impact your safety in Djibouti.

The security situation on the Djibouti and Eritrea border is unpredictable. Do not travel within 10km of the border with Eritrea.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid public gatherings, protests and demonstrations
* monitor the media for reports of planned or possible unrest
* follow instructions from local authorities

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Crime

Pickpocketing and other petty crimes can happen.

There have been reports of bandit groups outside the capital in areas where the law has broken down.

Crime risks increase at night and in isolated locations such as Dorale and Khor Ambado beaches.

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep vehicle windows closed, and doors locked at all times
* keep valuables out of sight, including when you're in a moving vehicle
* secure your accommodation against intruders at all times
* don't walk alone after dark

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

#### Piracy

There's a significant threat of piracy and armed robbery in Djibouti’s coastal waters and the Gulf of Aden, including the Sawabi (Sept-frères) Islands. You should limit unnecessary travel to these areas.

Pirates have attacked vessels and held foreigner's hostage for ransom in and around Djibouti's waters.

Limit unnecessary travel to the maritime regions of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.  

Attractive targets for pirates include:

* commercial vessels
* pleasure craft
* luxury cruise liners

You should remain out of the [designated High-Risk Area](https://www.mscio.eu/) or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. Check with the Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa) at [www.mschoa.org](http://www.mschoa.org/).

If you need to travel by boat to Djibouti's coastal waters and surrounds, you should:

* travel in a convoy and maintain good communications
* take appropriate security measures
* follow the latest advice from local authorities

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Parts of Djibouti, including the capital city are prone to floods.

#### Earthquake and volcanic eruptions

Earthquakes can happen.

Djibouti has one active volcano, Ardoukoba. It last erupted in 1978.

Ash from a volcanic eruption can fall over a wide area.

Volcanic ash, dust and toxic fumes are a significant health risk, especially for people with respiratory problems.

Know the safety measures at each place you stay.

To protect yourself during a volcanic eruption and avoid contact with ash:

* stay inside with the windows and doors shut
* if ash is falling, place damp towels at door thresholds and other draft sources
* wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants
* wear goggles

If you need to go outside, wear a disposable face-mask and change it frequently.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can happen.

Register for tsunami alerts from the [Global Disaster Alert and Co-ordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/).

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
