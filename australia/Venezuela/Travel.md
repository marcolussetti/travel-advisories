#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

If you decide to travel to Venezuela despite our advice, in most cases you won't need a visa for tourist visits of less than 90 days. However, you'll need:

* a passport valid for at least 6 months after you plan to depart the country
* proof of return or onward travel

Prior to travel, check with Venezuelan migration authorities ([SAIME - Servicio Administrativo de Identificación Migración y Extranjería](https://info.saime.gob.ve/)). 

You can be detained or deported if you don't comply with your visa conditions.

Ensure your visa status is up to date by contacting the [Venezuelan migration department (Spanish)](https://info.saime.gob.ve/).

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the nearest [Venezuelan embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/216) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're transiting via the USA, you must meet US entry and transit rules.

Check your visa requirements with the nearest [US embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212) well in advance of travel.

#### Border measures

We recommend that you do not travel to border areas or cross borders due to a high risk of terrorism and violent crime.

Do not attempt to cross Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana's borders by land.

Flights to and from Venezuela are limited.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Venezuela. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

* [Embassy or consulate of Venezuela](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/216)

#### Travel with children

To enter and leave Venezuela, children of any nationality under 18 years who travel alone or with one parent will need a certified copy of their birth certificate and a notarised permit. The permit must be obtained through the nearest local [SAREN](https://www.saren.gob.ve/) office or the respective Court for Children and Adolescents. It must include all the relevant travel details.

If the child resides overseas, the permit and birth certificate must be certified by a [Venezuelan embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/216). The child should carry this travel permit while travelling within the country and also at time of departure from Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country otherwise. Both documents must be translated into Spanish.

#### Departure tax

You'll have to pay a tax if you leave the country via an international airport.

Payment can be made in cash, in Venezuelan Bolivar.

The cost of your ticket sometimes includes the departure tax. Check with your airline.

Don't make any non-official payments at airports and ask for a receipt for any customs duty payments you make.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte (VEF).

It's not easy to exchange Australian dollars for local currency. Accessing money from an Australian bank account may be challenging.

There are 2 official exchange rates as well as black market rates. It's only legal to change money at the official government rate.

Differences in exchange rates can mean you need much larger amounts of Australian dollars for small purchases.

US dollars are accepted, but may not be available everywhere.

Money changers will exchange US dollars and travellers' cheques for VEF but generally can't convert them to other currencies.

The inflation rate is high.

Demand for large-value notes remains high, and notes are hard to obtain.

You are required to declare to authorities if you are entering or leaving Venezuela with more than US$10,000.

#### Credit cards and ATMs

Credit card transactions are charged at the official exchange rate.

Local EFTPOS machines don't always accept international credit cards. You may be prompted to enter your passport or identity document number when paying with a credit card.

ATMs have low limits for cash withdrawals on international cards. Don't rely on ATMs as your main way to access money.

With the shortage of banknotes, the local card payment system is under extra strain. Debit or credit card transactions may take longer than expected or require several attempts.

Credit card fraud is common. Always keep your card in sight.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Venezuela for up to 1 year if you have both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

After 1 year, you'll need to apply for a local driver's licence.

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving in Venezuela is dangerous.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* drunk drivers
* drivers ignoring red lights, particularly at night

Fuel shortages are common across all parts of the country.

Rural roads are often unmarked. They have little or no street lighting.

Make sure you have copies of insurance documents, driving licence and passport with you always. Failure to produce documents can result in your vehicle being seized by police.

There's a risk of extortion on roads outside major cities. Armed groups may pose as police and set up illegal roadblocks. Beware of attacks in tunnels. See [Safety](#safety)

At regular police and National Guard checkpoints:

* drive slowly
* stop if you're asked

Checkpoint officials might ask for bribes.

If you plan to drive in Venezuela:

* check you have the right insurance cover
* get to know local traffic laws and practices before driving
* get local advice and monitor local media about routes you plan to travel

Avoid hitchhiking and cycling.

There is a risk of theft on both inner city and inter city buses, especially at night.

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your insurance policy covers you to ride a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Crimes involving taxis occur. See [Safety](#safety)

If you need a taxi, use either:

* a pre-booked, licensed, radio-dispatch taxi
* a limousine service

Arrange these through your hotel. Don't hail taxis on the street.

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport. Theft is prevalent on public transport, including subway stations. Public transport providers, including state-owned companies, may not carry out routine maintenance. Services could be cancelled or delayed.

Your safety may be at risk.

#### Sea travel

Ferry companies may not look after their fleets properly. This could make them unsafe. Services could be cancelled or delayed.

Piracy occurs in the coastal areas of Venezuela. The International Maritime Bureau issues [piracy reports](http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always meet the safety standards you might expect.

They may not take safety precautions or follow maintenance schedules. Safety gear, such as life jackets and seatbelts, may not be provided.

If you plan do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurer covers it
* check the operators' credentials and safety equipment before booking
* ask about or insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, even if others don't

If standard safety equipment is not available, use another provider.
