## Overview

### Safety

* There's an increased risk of demonstrations and civil unrest. Venezuela's political situation is volatile. Avoid protests and large gatherings as they may turn violent.
* Common violent crime includes murder, armed robbery, drive-by shootings, sexual assault and carjackings. Criminals are often armed. Avoid walking in isolated areas, especially at night. Terrorist groups and criminal gangs are active along Venezuela's borders with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana.
* Kidnapping is a serious threat. The risk is higher along airport routes and in border regions. Only use official taxis organised through your hotel. Avoid kidnapping hotspots.
* Foreigners in Venezuela, including dual nationals are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Foreign and dual nationals have been detained without due process of law. The Australian Government may not be notified if you're detained. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Venezuela is extremely limited. We can't guarantee consular access to Australians detained or arrested. We also can't guarantee local authorities will allow access to legal representation.
* Shortages of basic goods can result in long line-ups at stores. This can lead to fighting, looting and theft. Be ready to change travel plans. Keep extra supplies of food, water, medicines and other necessities.
* Severe weather, earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding and landslides can occur. The rainy season is from May to December. Monitor local media and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) for updates.
* If you're in Venezuela, you should consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so. If despite our advice you remain in Venezuela, stay alert, keep stocks of essential supplies and be ready to leave at short notice.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Severe penalties for drug offences include long jail sentences. Carrying even a small amount of marijuana can result in jail time. Jails in Venezuela are dangerous and among the worst in the world.
* Drug trafficking in Venezuela is a big problem. Authorities screen travellers at the airport when they arrive and leave.
* It's illegal to photograph military sites and installations, sites of strategic importance and airports. Be careful when taking photos.

You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Venezuela for the latest details.
* Carry your yellow fever vaccination certificate. You may need to show it for onward travel.
* In some cases, a child cannot enter or exit Venezuela without written permission from both parents. If you're travelling with a child, you may need a letter of consent for travel.
