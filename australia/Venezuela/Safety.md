#### Crime

#### Violent crime

There's a high level of violent crime in Venezuela.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Venezuela:

* always pay close attention to your personal security
* monitor the media and other sources for new security risks

Actual crime rates may be higher than official figures indicate.

Violent crime occurs throughout Venezuela. Incidents include:

* murder
* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* drive-by shooting
* carjacking

Many criminals carry firearms. They may kill or injure you if you resist.

Police response times are poor. Most murders and major crimes go unsolved.

On roads, the threat of serious crime is high. Australian Government officials take extra security precautions when travelling by car in Venezuela.

Crimes you could come across include:

* mugging and kidnapping, sometimes by criminals posing as taxi drivers at Maiquetia Simon Bolivar Airport
* violent street crime and robbery near ATMs, money changers or damaged vehicles
* armed motorcycle gangs robbing passengers in vehicles stopped in heavy traffic
* 'express kidnappings', where criminals force you to withdraw funds from ATMs
* harassment and extortion by criminals posing as officials
* drink or food spiking, often followed by [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and [assault](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas"), including [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")
* widespread theft of credit card data.

Petty crime is also common. This includes:

* pickpocketing on public transport
* theft from hotel rooms, safe deposit boxes and rental cars

If you're in Venezuela, you should consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so. If despite our advice you remain in Venezuela, stay alert, keep stocks of essential supplies and be ready to leave at short notice.

#### Crime hotspots

Crime rates are high in Caracas, including in:

* central Caracas
* Sabana Grande district
* Avila National Park
* the Maiquetia Simon Bolivar Airport area, and the road between the airport and Caracas
* 'barrios' or 'ranchitos' slum areas, especially after dark

Crime is also high in:

* poorer areas, such as Cumana, Maracaibo, Paraguana and Valencia
* on the islands of Los Testigos
* Margarita Island (Isla de Margarita)
* tourist and resort areas

If you go to Venezuela despite our advice, arrive and leave Caracas during the day. Organise your transport before you arrive at the airport.

If possible, have a friend, family member or trusted transport service pick you up on arrival. Only use official taxis that you have booked through your hotel or from the official taxi rank outside the airport arrival hall. Be cautious of fake taxi drivers at the airport. Don't accept offers of transport in the arrivals hall, and do not board a taxi if there are other passengers already inside the car. Stay alert at the airport car park.

Criminal groups operate in the Maiquetia airport area. Members of these groups work inside the airport to spot passengers who appear to be wealthy and then inform carjackers and muggers waiting on the roads outside the airport. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery, electronic items or other valuables. Don't bring large amounts of cash to Venezuela.

Avoid travelling on the road between Caracas and Maiquetia airport after dark. There have been armed robberies on buses travelling to Maiquetia airport.

If you're coming to Venezuela to work, bring a letter from your employer and details of your local contact organisation (including a Spanish translation).

There have been occasions where passengers have been asked for bribes at the airport.

The National Guard carries out random drug and security checks at Maiquetia airport, particularly on departure. Departing passengers are sometimes asked to accompany an officer to a local hospital for an x-ray. Beware of people claiming to be security officials, if in doubt ask other airline or airport staff.

To stay safe when you're out and about:

* be alert to your surroundings and always pay attention to your safety and security
* carry only what you need — leave other valuables in a secure place
* keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* avoid walking or driving in secluded areas, especially at night
* exchange currency at official exchange booths only

If you're female, take extra care when dealing with strangers or people you've just met. Be especially wary about accepting rides or invitations.

Check the local situation before travelling to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bolívar State, as there may be protests and closures (sometimes for days) of Canaima airport and main roads.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Incapacitating drugs

Criminals may use drugs to subdue or incapacitate their victims. Robberies and assaults may occur after victims accept spiked drinks, food, cigarettes, chewing gum or paper handouts.

Always check that your drink has been opened or prepared in front of you. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended and don’t accept anything from strangers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Incidents of kidnapping in Venezuela have increased since 2020, partly due to the increased availability of foreign currency, which acts as an incentive for perpetrators to engage in the crime. Kidnapping gangs operate throughout the country, including near the border with Columbia. Criminal and Terrorist groups are active. Express kidnapping also occurs.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Protests and demonstrations

The political situation is volatile.

There's an increased risk of demonstrations and civil unrest following recent political developments. Avoid protests and large gatherings as they may turn violent. Demonstrations may disrupt travel plans, affect flights, traffic, and public transportation. Monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.

Demonstrations and other types of civil unrest are common, particularly in major urban centres, such as:

* Caracas
* Valencia
* Maracay
* Mérida
* San Cristóbal
* Maracaibo

Disruptions to essential services can occur.

On-the-spot demonstrations and other ongoing unrest are a risk. Violent incidents, arbitrary arrest or detention, and military responses are possible.

Roads and highways are often blocked during demonstrations, disrupting public transport systems.

Days of national significance could motivate civil unrest. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

National strikes can be called at short notice, often causing disruptions to:

* air travel
* public transport
* banking services
* government services

The economic situation in Venezuela continues to be unstable. Shortages of basic food items and necessities, including water, electricity, petrol and medical supplies, are common.

Power outages may impact communications, banking, and transportation, including airport operations and make international calls from Venezuela challenging.

Shortages of basic items and long lines at grocery stores have previously led to:

* fighting
* looting
* theft

If, despite our advice, you travel to Venezuela:

* avoid all protests, political activity and large public gatherings
* leave affected areas as soon as it's safe
* monitor the media and other sources for news about possible unrest
* be particularly alert during days of national significance
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* keep spare supplies of food, medicines and other necessities
* keep enough bottled water supplies on hand. Tap water is not safe for drinking.

#### Border areas

Avoid border areas, as they can be dangerous due to the presence of terrorist groups.

Most sea and air borders with Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao have re-opened. However, entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Monitor local media and contact your transport provider for updated information.

In border areas, there are limits on the right to:

* free movement
* assembly
* protest

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest")

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat in Venezuela.

Terrorist groups are particularly active in the region within 80km of Venezuela's border with Colombia. This region includes parts of:

* Bolívar
* Amazonas
* Apure
* Táchira
* Zulia
* Barinas

Colombian armed groups, such as the ELN (Ejército de Liberación Nacional) and criminal gangs, are active along Venezuela's borders with:

* Colombia
* Brazil

Hostages, including foreigners, have died after being kidnapped in these areas.

The Venezuelan military conducts searches and arrests in border regions, but threats remain. Troop movements and border closures can occur at short notice.

If, despite our advice, you decide to visit an area where there's a threat of kidnapping:

* find out about [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") before you travel
* seek professional security advice
* arrange effective personal security measures

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Risk of arbitrary detention or arrest

Foreigners in Venezuela, including dual nationals are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Foreign and dual nationals have been detained without due process of law. 

You may be at greater risk of detention if authorities are suspicious of your activities or background. You could attract the attention of authorities if you:

* study or do other academic activity
* travel outside tourist areas
* are near crowds, demonstrations or sensitive sites
* take photos, except in major tourist sites
* have contact with Venezuelans who are of interest to authorities
* behave or express views perceived as anti-Venezuelan, anti-Venezuelan Government, or that could cause religious offence
* are affiliated with, or have links to, Venezuelan opposition or other political groups.

The Australian Government may not be notified if you're detained. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Venezuela is extremely limited. We can't guarantee consular access to Australians detained or arrested. We also can't guarantee local authorities will allow access to legal representation.
