# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

You must carry photo ID in Venezuela. You can carry a copy of your passport and keep the original passport in a safe place. Local security forces may ask you to show a form of ID at any time, particularly at police checkpoints.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long sentences in dangerous local jails that are among the worst in the world.

If you're found with even a small quantity of marijuana, you may face a prison term.

Drug trafficking in Venezuela is a serious problem. Advanced detection methods have been introduced to help identify drug traffickers.

You'll be screened for drugs when you arrive and depart. You may also be screened while waiting in the airport.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to photograph:

* military buildings and surrounds
* sites of strategic importance, including the Presidential Palace and airports

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Australian-Venezuelan dual nationals must enter and leave Venezuela on a Venezuelan passport. This applies to children born to Venezuelans abroad, as they are assumed to be Venezuelan by local authorities. Contact the nearest [Venezuelan embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/216) for further information.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Venezuela has national service obligations. You may have to comply if you're a male dual citizen aged 18 years or older.
