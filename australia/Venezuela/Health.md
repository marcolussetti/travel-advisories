#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

You're likely to need a specialised insurance policy for travel to a 'do not travel' destination. Some Australian insurance policies may not cover you for travel to 'do not travel' destination.

#### Physical and mental health

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medications

Most pharmacies, including in hospitals, no longer stock basic medicine or supplies due to short supply.

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Venezuela with the nearest [Venezuelan Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/216). Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Rates of insect-borne and infectious diseases are increasing. Diseases not seen for many years are re-emerging.

Venezuela has [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever). Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs year-round in some areas of Venezuela. The risk is highest in rural areas including:

* Apure
* Amazonas
* Barinas
* Bolívar, including the Angel Falls
* Delta Amacuro
* Monagas
* Sucre
* Táchira

Strains of malaria that are hard to treat have been reported.

Other insect-borne diseases in Venezuela include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you develop a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, and other widespread infectious diseases include:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [Venezuelan haemorrhagic fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/viral-haemorrhagic-fevers)
* [measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles)
* [mumps](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/mumps)
* [rubella](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rubella)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To reduce your risk of illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Visit a doctor if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of public medical facilities in major cities is poor. It's even poorer in rural areas.

Basic medical supplies and medicines are hard to find.

Caracas and other major cities have good private hospitals and clinics. These hospitals are expensive and often require up-front cash payment. Bear in mind that they may also be affected by medication and power shortages.

Most healthcare providers don't speak English.

Emergency and ambulance services are very limited. Response times are slow, especially in rural areas.

Find hyperbaric chambers at:

* Unidad de Buceo PDVSA in Lagunillas Norte
* Hospital Naval Raul Perdomo in Catia La Mar
* Compania Oriente marine Group in Puerto La Cruz
* Venezuela Divers in Ciudad Ojeda

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to Caracas. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 (free of charge) from a landline or mobile phone.
