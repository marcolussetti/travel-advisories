#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

You'll need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to the CAR.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars upfront for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the CAR. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

Medical facilities throughout the CAR are limited.

Medicines are in short supply and hygiene standards are poor. You're likely to have to pay up front for treatment.

If you get seriously ill or injured, you could need treatment at a more suitable place. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any mpox symptoms.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in the CAR. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel and carry your vaccination card. Some countries require you to present your yellow fever vaccination card if you have travelled to the CAR.

[Mpox](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox#tab=tab_1) (also known as Monkeypox) is endemic in parts of Africa. In areas where Mpox is found, you should avoid contact with animals, especially primates and rodents.

Other common insect-borne diseases include:

* [Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)
* [Filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [African sleeping sickness](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trypanosomiasis-human-african-(sleeping-sickness))

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are widespread. These include:

* [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids)
* [Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

* [Meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food
* avoid fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice.
