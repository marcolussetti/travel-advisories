# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Proof of identity

Always carry proof of identity. This can be a notarised copy. Police checks are common. Police might detain or fine you if you can't show them identity documents.

#### Photography

Unauthorised photography is illegal. Don't take photos of:

* military zones
* military assets
* military or police personnel
* government buildings
* mining leases

If you do, police may confiscate your camera, fine you and detain you.

You need a government permit to take photos. The government will not grant permits for strategic sites such as:

* the airport
* military buildings
* the Presidential Palace

It's not permitted to take photographs the authorities think damage the country’s image (for example, of street children and people with disabilities).

#### Gem licences

A licence is necessary to buy or sell gems. There are heavy penalties for illegally exporting precious gems. It's only legal to purchase diamonds or precious stones through government-authorised agents.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

While homosexuality is not illegal, same-sex relationships are not widely accepted in Central African society. LGBTQIA+ travellers may face arrest for public displays of affection.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
