## Overview

### Safety

* There are ongoing military operations throughout the CAR. If it's safe to do so, leave the CAR. Tensions are high. Armed groups operate across the country. They've killed foreigners, including aid workers and peacekeepers.
* The security situation outside Bangui is extremely volatile. A nationwide curfew is in place from 10pm to 5am, except for Bangui. Avoid travelling at night in Bangui due to security risks.
* If despite our advice you plan to travel to the CAR, take personal safety measures. Law enforcement and peacekeepers can't ensure your safety.
* The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) regularly attacks civilians in the southeast of the CAR, especially Haut-Mbomou province. Be alert to possible threats.
* Kidnapping and violent crime occur. Kidnappers can target foreigners. Seek professional security advice.
* Bandit groups are common. They target aid groups to get money, vehicles and equipment. Be very careful when carrying large amounts of money. If possible, split it between your travelling companions. Carry photocopies of key documents and leave originals in hotel safes or other secure locations.
