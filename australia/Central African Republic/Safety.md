# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Tensions are high throughout the country. The security situation can worsen suddenly and without warning.

For your safety, be aware that:

* armed groups are active across the country
* many areas outside the capital are in a state of lawlessness
* armed groups and criminals set up illegal roadblocks without notice
* armed groups have killed foreigners, including aid workers and peacekeepers
* border areas are very dangerous

The security situation is unstable. This is despite the presence of a United Nations stabilisation mission. Inter-communal violence is frequent and widespread, particularly in rural areas. Thousands of people have been killed.

Law enforcement is unable to ensure your security.

A nationwide curfew is in place from 10pm to 5am, except for Bangui. Avoid travelling at night in Bangui and to the PK5 district at any time due to security risks. Local authorities may impose curfews and restrictions without warning.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Protests have previously resulted in deaths and injuries. You should leave the area immediately if you're near any protests, marches or demonstrations. Stay alert and follow the local news, as the situation can change quickly and without warning. Stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.

If it's safe to do so, leave the CAR. If you stay in the CAR, take personal safety measures.

#### Terrorism

The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) operates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda. It regularly attacks south-eastern parts of the CAR, especially Haut-Mbomou province.

LRA attacks target civilians. The LRA has killed many people and thousands more have fled the region.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping and violent crime occur in the CAR. Criminals have targeted foreigners, including aid workers. The risk of kidnapping for both nationals and foreigners has increased.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

Bandit groups and crime are common throughout the CAR.

Serious, indiscriminate violence and looting occurs in the CAR. It has been widespread in parts of Bangui and regional areas. Incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence are common.

Local police and security forces sometimes set up random roadblocks.

At times people posing as officials set up roadblocks. Armed groups may attempt to extort money from travellers through fake fines or intimidation.

Criminals target aid groups to get money, communication equipment and vehicles.

If you're carrying large amounts of money, be very careful. If possible, share the holding of it with your travelling companions.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* [volcanic activity](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

The rainy season is from May to October. The dry season is from December to April.

You can't drive on some roads during the rainy season. Roads close due to [flooding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters), including the three main routes entering Bangui.
