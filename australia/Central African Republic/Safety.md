# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Tensions are high throughout the country. The security situation can worsen suddenly and without warning.

The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and other paramilitary groups regularly attacks civilians in the southeast of the CAR, especially Haut-Mbomou province. Be alert to possible threats.

A nationwide curfew is in place from 12am to 5am, except for Bangui. Avoid travelling at night in Bangui and to the PK5 district at any time due to security risks. Local authorities may impose curfews and restrictions without warning.

For your safety, be aware that:

* armed groups are active across the country
* many areas outside the capital are in a state of lawlessness
* armed groups and criminals set up illegal roadblocks without notice
* armed groups have killed foreigners, including aid workers and peacekeepers
* border areas are very dangerous

The security situation is unstable. This is despite the presence of a United Nations stabilisation mission. Inter-communal violence is frequent and widespread, particularly in rural areas. Thousands of people have been killed.

Law enforcement is unable to ensure your security.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Protests have previously resulted in deaths and injuries. You should leave the area immediately if you're near any protests, marches or demonstrations. Stay alert and follow the local news, as the situation can change quickly and without warning. Stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces. Avoid moving around Bangui during times of civil unrest.

If it's safe to do so, leave the CAR. If you stay in the CAR, take personal safety measures.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. 

The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) operates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda. It regularly attacks south-eastern parts of the CAR, especially Haut-Mbomou province.

LRA attacks target civilians. The LRA has killed many people and thousands more have fled the region.

Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping and violent crime occur in the CAR. Criminals have targeted foreigners, including aid workers. The risk of kidnapping for both nationals and foreigners has increased.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

 You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

Avoid any road travel outside Bangui. If you decide to undertake road travel outside Bangui despite our advice, always travel in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, with convoy of at least 2 vehicles and during daylight hours.

#### Crime

Bandit groups and crime are common throughout the CAR.

Serious, indiscriminate violence and looting occurs in the CAR. It has been widespread in parts of Bangui and regional areas. Incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence are common.

Local police and security forces sometimes set up random roadblocks.

At times people posing as officials set up roadblocks. Armed groups may attempt to extort money from travellers through fake fines or intimidation.

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, occurs regularly.

Criminals target aid groups to get money, communication equipment and vehicles.

If you're carrying large amounts of money, be very careful. If possible, share the holding of it with your travelling companions.

#### Protests and civil unrest

Protests may occur spontaneously, and mob violence against individuals implicated in crimes or accidents can occur. Harassment of foreign nationals is prevalent, as are assertive protests against international organisations.

* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories
* Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Find information on natural disasters from the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/).

#### Flooding

The rainy season is from May to October. The dry season is from December to April.

You can't drive on some roads during the rainy season. Roads close due to [flooding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters), including the three main routes entering Bangui.

Most roads outside Bangui are unpaved.
