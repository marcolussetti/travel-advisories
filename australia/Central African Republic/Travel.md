#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If you decide to travel to the CAR despite our advice, contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of the Central African Republic](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) for details of visa and entry requirements. The [Consulate-General of France in Sydney](https://au.ambafrance.org/-Sydney_en-) may be able to help you get your visas for the CAR. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

#### Border measures

Land border crossings may not be open to tourists. Border crossings may close at short notice.

You're required to present your yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter the CAR.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever

You’re required to carry a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter the CAR.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Make sure your passport has at least two blank pages.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Very few ATMs are available in Bangui.

Bangui has several Western Union offices, but only a few banks. Most hotels, supermarkets and restaurants catering to foreigners only accept cash.

The currency is the Central African CFA Franc (XAF). Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea also use the XAF.

Bangui is the only city where you can change money. You can usually convert euros or US dollars into local currency. Keep alert when changing money through official or unofficial change agents.

#### Local travel

Travel throughout the CAR is dangerous. You might encounter:

* armed groups
* bandits
* poachers
* illegal roadblocks

Civilians and military travelling in convoys have been attacked and killed.

#### Yellow fever

You’re required to carry a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter the CAR.

Find out about returning to Australia after exposure to [yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) (Department of Health and Aged Care).

#### Road travel

Roads in the CAR are in a very poor condition. Driving at night is dangerous due to poor lighting. Most roads require a 4WD vehicle. Fuel shortages are common.

Avoid any road travel outside Bangui. If you decide to undertake road travel outside Bangui despite our advice, always travel in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, with convoy of at least 2 vehicles and during daylight hours.

The rainy season is May to October. Sometimes flooding occurs and roads become impassable.

Authorities may close borders or set up roadblocks without warning. This is due to the presence of armed groups and risk of cross border incursions.

#### Air travel

Few commercial airlines fly to Bangui.

Be aware of your personal belongings even within the airport terminal.

Check the [CAR's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TL) with the Aviation Safety Network.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
