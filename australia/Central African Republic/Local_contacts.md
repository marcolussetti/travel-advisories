# Local contacts

#### Emergencies

Depending on what you need, contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline

#### Medical emergencies

Call 117 or 610 600.

Emergency numbers are unreliable in the Central African Republic. The emergency services are unlikely to respond outside of Bangui. Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

#### Police

Call 117 or 2161 2200.

Always get a police report when you report a crime.

Your insurer should have a 24-hour emergency number.

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can’t do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in the CAR. You can contact the Australian Embassy in Ethiopia. Our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in the CAR is severely limited.
