#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your airline or your nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Spain](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/185) for details about the latest visa and entry requirements. 

Spain is a part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries. This allows you to enter without a visa in some cases. 

You'll need a visa if:

* you plan to stay longer than 90 days
* your reason for travel changes, and you no longer qualify for visa-free travel.

Ensure you get a legible entry stamp in your passport when you first enter the Schengen Area.

Some airlines may want to see proof of entry in the Schengen Area or to check you haven't overstayed the 90-day period. 

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Spain](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/185) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. 

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/185) [Spain](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/185) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

Carry copies of your passport as a photocopy or as a photo on your phone in case authorities stop you (See 'Local laws').

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Spain is the Euro (€).

If you're travelling to or from any non-European Union (EU) country, declare funds of 10,000 Euro or more, including the equivalent in another currency. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you fail to declare currency or give wrong information, you'll be fined.

You don't need to declare funds if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the Schengen Area.

To avoid delays:

* monitor the local media for border conditions
* ask your transport provider for updates

#### Driving permit

To drive a vehicle, you'll need both:

* a current Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)
* a valid international driving permit (IDP). Contact the [Australia Automobile Association](https://www.aaa.asn.au) for further information.

If you drive without an IDP, you may be fined and your car impounded.

#### Road travel

Be cautious when you drive or travel as a passenger. Keep your doors locked, even when moving. Lock your vehicle when you leave it.

Driving in urban areas can be dangerous due to:

* traffic congestion
* aggressive driving
* excessive speeding

Check your vehicle has 2 red warning triangles and a reflective jacket. You must use these in an accident or breakdown.

You can be fined if your vehicle doesn't have these items.

If you hire a vehicle, get safety equipment. Ask the rental company about local traffic rules.
