# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks in Spain are likely. 

The national terrorism alert level for Spain is 'high'. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could occur anywhere, any time and without warning.

In recent years, terrorists have staged attacks in Spain and other European cities. Targets have included:

* public transport
* transport hubs
* places of worship
* sporting venues
* public places popular with tourists

Spain has increased security in public places, such as:

* shopping areas
* tourist sites
* transport hubs
* major events that attract large crowds

Security services have stopped some planned attacks.

To reduce your risk, you should:

* be aware of possible threats when planning activities
* be alert in public places known to be possible terrorist targets
* monitor the media for updates
* report anything suspicious to the police
* follow official warnings
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations occur regularly throughout Spain.

Demonstrations and strikes can disrupt traffic and transport, including air, rail and other public services.

Some demonstrations held close to tourist areas in large cities have ended in clashes with police and resulted in injuries.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To reduce risks:

* avoid protests and demonstrations, and exercise caution if you're caught up in large gatherings/protests
* monitor local media for possible strikes and unrest
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

In the event of a protest or demonstration, contact your travel agent or tour operator for information on your transport bookings. Be ready to change your plans.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common in large cities. It's a serious problem in Barcelona, especially on public transport and tourist areas.

Petty crime includes:

* bag snatching
* pickpocketing
* theft from cars

Thieves are very active during the peak summer tourist season. They target:

* tourist attractions
* public transport, railway stations and cruise terminals
* airports, including airside, after passing through airport security
* museums
* beaches
* restaurants and cafes
* hotel foyers
* car parking areas or car hire companies

Take care when placing bags on chairs or the ground in restaurants and outdoor cafes.

Thieves often work in gangs. While you're distracted, another thief steals your belongings. Thieves try to distract you by:

* asking for help or directions
* deliberately spilling something on you

Violent theft is less common but may also occur. 

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* take care of your personal belongings, especially in crowds
* leave your passport and other valuables in a safe location
* avoid walking in quiet, poorly lit streets
* monitor local sources for information about possible safety or security risks

Keep your passport and other ID separate. We recommend you carry a copy of your passport for ID, either as a hard copy or as a photo on your phone.

#### Road crime

Road crime occurs throughout Spain.

Take care driving from Marseille in France to Valencia in Spain along the Mediterranean coast. Cars with foreign number plates are often targets.

Thieves working in pairs may convince you to stop because of a 'problem' with your vehicle, then offer to help with a flat or slashed tyre. While one helps, the other steals your belongings.

Never leave your luggage unattended, even inside your vehicle. Keep luggage and personal belongings out of sight.

To stay safe when on the road:

* never leave valuables in your vehicle
* be wary of offers of help
* always keep car doors locked, even when driving
* use secure parking facilities when you can, especially overnight
* don't leave your vehicle unattended for long periods

Thieves also break into caravans and motor homes, particularly in public parking areas.

#### Credit card fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud can occur.

Avoid using ATMs that open onto the street, especially at night. Use ATMs in banks, shops, and shopping centres.

#### Drink spiking

Cases of drink spiking, followed by theft and [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), are reported.

To protect yourself from crime:

* stick with people you trust in bars and nightclubs
* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* don't leave your food or drink unattended

* Call 112 for 24-hour assistance from any of the emergency services in Spain. English-speaking staff are available.
* Call 016 (Whatsapp 600 000 016 or email [016-online@msssi.es](mailto:016-online@msssi.es)). This is a 24 hours a day, 365 days a year helpline for victims of gender violence. It is accessible for people with hearing difficulties and is available in 53 languages.

#### Scams

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") are common.

Be aware of the latest scams. Don't become a victim.

Some complex scam operations are based in Spain. Inheritance scams are the most common.

Inheritance scams involve receiving an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer. They tell you an unknown Spanish relative has died and left you money.

If you've been a victim of a scam, don't travel to Spain. Seek legal advice.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Severe weather

Spain experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"),  especially along the northern coast and islands.

Heavy snow in winter (December to February) can affect northern areas.

If there's a natural disaster, follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Earthquakes

Spain experiences [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"), but major quakes are rare.

Volcanic eruptions occurred in 2021 on La Palma in the Canary Islands. There's seismic activity on the Canary Island of El Hierro. The risk level set by local authorities is Green, which is level 1 of 3.

#### Forest fires

[Forest fires](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire "There's a bushfire") can occur from May to September. The risk is higher in rural areas.

Strict fines apply for any actions that could start a fire. If camping, ask local authorities for advice on fire danger and fire restrictions.

If there's a forest fire:

* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
* keep in contact with family and friends
* monitor the media for updates

#### Adventure travel

#### Running of the Bulls

Taking part in the Running of the Bulls is dangerous. Every year, people are badly injured and sometimes killed.

People are also killed or badly injured jumping from fountains during the festivities in Pamplona.

Ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities. Don't take unnecessary risks. 

Your travel insurance may not cover you if:

* you take part in the Running of the Bulls
* jump from fountains
* take other risks

Medicare doesn't cover you if you're in Spain.

#### Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown in the sea and in swimming pools in Spain.

Some beaches, especially around Spanish islands, may have strong undercurrents. 

Swim at supervised beaches and follow the flag system that warns against dangerous swimming conditions. 

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* regularly check weather reports
* take warnings seriously
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment and weather conditions before continuing with planned activities
* if possible, take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities
