#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Spain. Contact the Spanish Embassy or Consulate in Australia before travelling to Spain. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

You can't mail or courier medication from Australia to Spain.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Contact DFAT if you need medical documents [authenticated](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services").

#### Health risks

Health risks are similar to those in Australia.

Monitor the media and other sources for new health risks.

Follow the advice of [Spain's Ministry of Health](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/en/)

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Spain is similar to those in Australia.

Most doctors don't speak English. A list of English-speaking doctors and medical facilities can be found on the [Australian Embassy](https://spain.embassy.gov.au/madr/OtherServices.html) website. 

There's no shared healthcare agreement between Australia and Spain. 

Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
