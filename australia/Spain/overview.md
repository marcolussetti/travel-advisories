### Travel

* Spain is a part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries. This allows you to enter without a visa in some cases. You'll need a visa if you're travelling for a purpose other than tourism.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Spain](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/185)for more details.
