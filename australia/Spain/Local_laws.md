# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include heavy fines and prison time.

#### Other laws

Always carry personal ID. This may include:

* your original driver's licence (digital driver's licences are not accepted)
* a copy of your passport, either in hardcopy or as a photo on your phone

Police may ask to see ID. They can detain you until they can confirm your identity. Carry a copy of your Australian passport as a hard copy or a photo on your phone.

Don't photograph military installations.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Spain doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).
