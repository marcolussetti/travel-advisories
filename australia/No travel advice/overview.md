## Getting help

### Emergencies

Depending on what you need, contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline

Your insurer should have a 24-hour emergency number.

### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Find the closest [Australian Embassy or Consulate](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).
