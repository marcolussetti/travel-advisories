# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Zambian authorities don't always contact the Australian Embassy in Harare when they detain or arrest an Australian citizen.

If you're detained, ask to contact the Australian Honorary Consulate in Lusaka or the Australian Embassy in Harare.

#### Drugs

Possession of small quantities of an illegal substance can constitute drug trafficking in Zambia. Penalties for drug-related crimes are severe. They include long prison sentences and heavy fines.

#### Other laws

Police and border officials can ask to see your passport and immigration stamp or visa at any time. They could detain or arrest you if you don't have them. 

Always carry your passport and visa or immigration permit. You can get certified copies from the issuing office.

In Zambia, it's illegal to:

* have pornographic material
* take photos of government buildings, military areas and buildings or personnel
* buy or trade in endangered wildlife products, such as tortoise shells, ivory and rhino horn, or any products made of these materials without a licence

Consensual sexual activity between individuals of the same sex is illegal in Zambia. If convicted, you could be sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.

#### Dual nationality

Zambia recognises dual nationals.

Local authorities may consider you a Zambian national if you're both an Australian and Zambian national. This may limit the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services) we can give if you're arrested or detained. You should enter and exit the country using the same passport.
