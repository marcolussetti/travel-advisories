## Overview

### Safety

* Opportunistic petty crime, including pickpocketing, bag snatching, and vehicle break-ins, is common. Security risks increase after dark, especially in tourist areas and city centres. Stay alert to your surroundings. Avoid walking alone or travelling after dark. Keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving.
* Spontaneous demonstrations are common, and peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. Avoid all protests, political rallies and large public gatherings.
* Date-rape drugs have been used in bars and restaurants in Lusaka. Always keep a close eye on your food and drinks. If you're not sure it's safe, leave it.
* Thieves sometimes follow people after they withdraw money from ATMs. Avoid using ATMs at night, and be vigilant of your surroundings as you withdraw money.
