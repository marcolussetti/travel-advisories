## Overview

### Safety

* We've lowered our advice for the border areas with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to exercise a high degree of caution due to the threat of armed criminal gangs, undetected landmines and unexploded ordinance.
* Opportunistic petty crime, including pickpocketing, bag snatching, and vehicle break-ins, is common. Security risks increase after dark, especially in tourist areas and city centres. Stay alert to your surroundings. Avoid walking alone or travelling after dark. Keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving.
* Spontaneous demonstrations are common, and peaceful demonstrations can turn violent. Avoid all protests, political rallies and large public gatherings.
* Date-rape drugs have been used in bars and restaurants in Lusaka. Always keep a close eye on your food and drinks. If you're not sure it's safe, leave it.
* Thieves sometimes follow people after they withdraw money from ATMs. Avoid using ATMs at night, and be vigilant of your surroundings as you withdraw money.

* Malaria and other insect-borne diseases occur. Cholera and other infectious diseases are common.
* There are regular outbreaks of cholera and anthrax. Boil all drinking water or drink bottled water in rural areas. Avoid contact with animals and do not eat raw or uncooked meat. Don't swim in freshwater. Use insect repellent.
* There's an outbreak of Mpox in parts of Africa, including in Zambia. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

### Local laws

* It's illegal to possess or use drugs, including marijuana. Being in the possession of drugs, even a very small amount, can be considered drug trafficking. Penalties for drug-related crimes are severe.
* You are subject to all local laws and penalties.
* Zambian authorities don't always contact the Australian Embassy in Harare when they detain or arrest Australians. If you're detained, ask to contact the Australian Honorary Consulate in Lusaka or the Australian Embassy in Harare.
* Police and border officials can ask to see your passport and immigration stamp or visa at any time. They could detain or arrest you if you don't have them.
* Consensual sexual activity between individuals of the same sex is illegal in Zambia. If convicted, you could face long terms of imprisonment.
