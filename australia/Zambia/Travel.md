#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

Australian passport holders do not require a visa to enter Zambia. Ordinary visitors and tourists can enter for 90 days in any period of 12 months from the day of first entry into Zambia.

Business visitors can enter for 30 days in any period of 12 months. Business visitors may be required to present a letter of invitation from the sponsoring organisation.

If arriving by air, you must have a valid return air ticket. If you're arriving by land or water, you must have enough funds for your stay and departure from Zambia.

A KAZA UNVISA is valid for travel between Zambia and Zimbabwe and day trips to Botswana through the Kaungula border. You can get a KAZA UNVISA if you enter via:

* Lusaka or Livingstone international airports
* Livingstone land border with Zimbabwe
* Kazungula land border with Botswana

You can also apply for a KAZA UNVISA online. It costs US$50 and is valid for 30 days.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Information on entry and visa requirements can be found at [For Visitors – Zambia Department of Immigration](https://www.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/for-visitors/), or contact the nearest [high commission embassy or consulate of Zambia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/221) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Permits and departure levy

To work in Zambia, including as a volunteer, you'll need an employment permit. For more details, please see [the Zambian Department of Immigration](https://www.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/).

To live in Zambia, you'll need a residence permit. For more details, see the [Zambian Department of Immigration](https://www.zambiaimmigration.gov.zm/).

If you don't comply with these or other immigration rules, authorities may detain you.

Some Zambian immigration agents may issue fake documents. Make proper checks before and after using a local agent to get a visa or permit.

If you fly within or out of Zambia, you must pay the National Airports Corporation levy. The levy isn't often included in airline tickets. You'll have to pay the levy in US dollars or Zambian Kwacha.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate if you're arriving from a country where there's widespread yellow fever.

#### Ebola virus

If you're travelling from an Ebola-affected area, you may be subject to a medical check at the Zambian border.

Zambian authorities have refused entry to people arriving from Ebola-affected countries. When there are outbreaks, authorities may ban people arriving from affected areas.

#### Passport

To enter Zambia, you must have 6 months remaining validity on your passport and have at least 3 blank pages. If you don't, you may be denied entry. If you're travelling to multiple African countries on one trip, ensure you have enough blank pages to accommodate the requirements of all countries you plan to visit.

You can end up stranded if your passport does not have at least 6 months remaining validity.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Travel via South Africa

If you're travelling through South Africa, South African authorities do not accept provisional travel documents. South African authorities do accept Australian emergency passports. 

Strict rules apply to a child aged under 18 years travelling through South Africa. 

Check out our [travel advice for South Africa](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/south-africa). 

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' in the gender/sex field.

#### Money

The local currency is the Zambia Kwacha (ZMW).

Declare any ZMW and foreign currency over USD5000 when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You must use ZMW to pay in Zambia. It's against the law to quote or pay in foreign currency for local goods or services. If you do, you could be fined or jailed for 10 years.

Use well-known reputable banks or currency exchange companies to change or withdraw money. Fake USD100 and ZMW notes are common.

Zambian banks and foreign exchange agents won't accept US banknotes issued before 2000.

Zambia revalued its currency in 2013. Old notes are not accepted. Make sure you receive correct and legal notes.

ATMs are available in main cities but may not accept international cards.

Most hotels, restaurants and shops in major urban centres accept credit cards. Many companies charge a fee to use a credit card.

Credit card fraud occurs in Zambia. See [Safety](#safety)

#### Local travel

#### Local restrictions

Land borders may be closed to non-essential traffic with little or no notice.

#### Border areas

There may be landmines and other explosives near Zambia's borders with:

* Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
* Angola
* Mozambique

These may not be marked.

Off-road travel in these areas is dangerous.

Take care when travelling in rural parts of Zambia close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The border is not demarcated and there is a risk of inadvertently illegally entering DRC.

If you travel to these border areas despite the risks, ask local authorities about the safest routes.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Zambia, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Zambia than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* poor driving habits
* pedestrians and animals on roads
* poorly maintained vehicles and roads
* not enough lighting

Traffic accidents often happen along the Great East Road in Lusaka. Emergency services are unreliable.

Cars in Zambia must carry two metallic emergency triangles with white reflective stickers on the front. Red reflective stickers must appear on the back.

Drivers must carry identity documents.

You must get a temporary import permit if you want to take a vehicle into Zambia.

You'll also need to buy third-party insurance at the border. If you're not the vehicle owner, you must have a letter from the owner saying you can use the vehicle in Zambia.

Police roadblocks are common.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have enough insurance cover
* get to know local traffic laws and practices
* if you hire a vehicle, make sure it has emergency triangles
* avoid driving after dark in rural areas

Always carry your ID, such as your driver's licence, when driving.

#### Motorcycles

Ask your travel insurer if your policy covers you using a motorbike or similar vehicle. Your policy may not cover you for accidents in these vehicles.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines, preferably arranged through your hotel.

#### Public transport

There's no reliable public transport in Zambia.

Avoid long-distance buses. They are poorly maintained and often overloaded.

#### Boat travel

Travelling on riverboats is dangerous. They can be overloaded and lack necessary lifesaving gear.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.
