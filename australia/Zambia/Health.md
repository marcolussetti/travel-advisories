#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Medications containing diphenhydramine, such as Benadryl, are regulated in Zambia.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Zambia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

If your medication is illegal in Zambia, ask your doctor in Australia about alternatives.

Always carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor saying:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

You could be arrested and jailed if you don't carry your prescription.

#### Health risks

#### Anthrax

Outbreaks of [anthrax](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/anthrax) occur in Zambia, affecting both rural and urban provinces. Avoid dead animals or carcasses. Purchase meat from reputable sources, and do not eat raw or undercooked meat. Avoid animal products that could have been sourced from animals that may have died of natural causes. If you suspect that you may have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Zambia.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms may include:

* rash, fever, sore throat and headaches
* muscle aches and back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any mpox symptoms.

If you're the victim of a violent crime, including [rape](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault), see a doctor immediately.

#### Insect-borne diseases

There is a high risk of [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) throughout the year across Zambia. Consider medication to prevent malaria. Consult your doctor about which medication to take and for how long.

Other insect-borne diseases, including those listed by the World Health Organization:

To protect yourself from illness:

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in Zambia is poor, especially in rural areas.

Medical supplies are limited. Some prescription medicines may not be available.

Know your blood type. Carry a sterile medical kit, including needles and dressings.

Most doctors and hospitals require up-front cash payment.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities, such as South Africa, Europe or the United States. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. You should have appropriate travel insurance in place before you travel.
