#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Medications containing diphenhydramine, such as Benadryl, are regulated in Zambia.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Zambia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

If your medication is illegal in Zambia, ask your doctor in Australia about alternatives.

Always carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor saying:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

You could be arrested and jailed if you don't carry your prescription.

#### Health risks

#### Anthrax

Outbreaks of [anthrax](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/anthrax) occur in Zambia, affecting both rural and urban provinces. Avoid dead animals or carcasses. Purchase meat from reputable sources, and do not eat raw or undercooked meat. Avoid animal products that could have been sourced from animals that may have died of natural causes. If you suspect that you may have come into contact with anthrax, seek urgent medical advice.

#### Mpox

There's currently an outbreak of Mpox in parts of Africa, including in Zambia. Mpox can be fatal. Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms may include:

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

**Copperbelt Province – Precautions Against Heavy Metal Poisoning**

A toxic waste spill into the Mwambashi stream ecosystem in February 2025 has caused severe environmental damage and may cause serious risks to public health in the Chambishi, Mwambashi and Kitwe areas of the Copperbelt Province.

If you must travel to the affected area:

* Follow local public health and environmental guidance regarding water safety and food
* Only use water that is known to be safe for drinking, bathing or cooking. Boiling water does not remove heavy metals
* Avoid consuming fish sourced from or which may have passed through the affected area
* Seek medical attention if you are concerned about any symptoms you may have.

The US Embassy in Zambia has provided the following information on the spill - [Health Alert – U.S. Embassy Lusaka, Zambia, August 6, 2025 - U.S. Embassy in Zambia](https://zm.usembassy.gov/health-alert-u-s-embassy-lusaka-zambia/).

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in Zambia is poor, especially in rural areas.

Medical supplies are limited. Some prescription medicines may not be available.

Know your blood type. Carry a sterile medical kit, including needles and dressings.

Most doctors and hospitals require up-front cash payment.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities, such as South Africa, Europe or the United States. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. You should have appropriate travel insurance in place before you travel.
