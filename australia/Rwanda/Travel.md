#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Tourist visa

Citizens of Commonwealth countries receive free 30-day tourist visas on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [High Commission of Rwanda](https://www.rwandainsingapore.gov.rw/) in Singapore or the [Consulate General of the Republic of Rwanda in Australia](https://rwandacg.org.au/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Working or volunteering in Rwanda

You need a valid permit to work or volunteer in Rwanda. The permit is available through the Rwanda Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

Australian emergency passports are only accepted with pre-approval from the [Rwandan immigration department](https://www.migration.gov.rw/).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier:

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Access to money

The currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc (RWF).

Rwanda is a cash-based society, but electronic payments and online banking are increasingly available.

Not all hotels/restaurants accept credit cards, especially outside of Kigali. Find out which credit cards your hotel/restaurant accepts before you travel.

You can only cash travellers’ cheques at commercial banks.

Not all ATMs accept international cards.

Most shops and businesses won't accept or change US dollars dated before 2006.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Rwanda than in Australia.

To drive in Rwanda, you'll require both your Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) and an International Driver's Permit.

Main roads between Kigali and other major towns are generally good.

You'll likely need a 4WD to use unsealed secondary roads, particularly during the rainy season.

Avoid driving at night.

Police roadblocks are common throughout the country. They may stop you. Police may search your vehicle and luggage.

Road safety risks include:

* poorly lit roads
* poorly maintained vehicles
* speeding drivers
* roaming animals

#### Motorcycles

Traffic in Rwanda can be chaotic and unpredictable. Riding on motorcycles is risky for travellers.

If you plan to ride a motorcycle:

* check your travel insurance policy covers motorcycle rides
* use a well-known hire company with a good reputation
* always wear a helmet
* never ride or drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

#### Taxis

Use only licensed taxis with an orange-stripe.

Confirm the fare before you leave.

Avoid minivans (shared taxis) and motorbikes, especially at night. They're risky due to reckless driving, poor maintenance and petty crime.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Rwanda's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9XR) with the Aviation Safety Network.

Rwandan airports have extensive airports security checks. You should allow sufficient time to get through security.
