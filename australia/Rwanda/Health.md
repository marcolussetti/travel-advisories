#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Rwanda. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Rwanda.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms may include:

* rash, fever, sore throat and headaches
* muscle aches and back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any mpox symptoms.

#### Ebola

The Rwandan Ministry of Health has established measures for travellers arriving from areas of the DRC that are affected by Ebola virus disease.

If you are arriving in Rwanda from an Ebola affected area, you're required to undergo thermal scanner screening.

If you're transiting from the DRC, the Rwandan Ministry of Health may impose a 21-day quarantine period on your arrival.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs widely throughout the country, including in Kigali.

Other insect-borne diseases also occur, such as [dengue,](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/Chikungunya), [African tick-bite fever](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/african-tick-bite-fever).

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is mosquito-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medication to prevent malaria.

#### HIV/AIDS

Protect yourself from [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection if engaging in activities that expose you to risk.

If you're a victim of violent crime, including [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), get medical help as soon as possible.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/meningitis#tab=tab_1)/ [meningococcal disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningococcal-meningitis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

There was an outbreak of [Marburg virus disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease) in Rwanda in 2024. The Rwandan Ministry of Health has declared that the outbreak is over. 

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals
* avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Don't swim in fresh water to avoid exposure to waterborne diseases, such as [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis).

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

If you're in an accident or get sick, you may need to be evacuated by air ambulance to Nairobi, Kenya. You may need to travel further if your condition is serious. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
