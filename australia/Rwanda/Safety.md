#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Border areas

There's active fighting near the Rwandan border in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including shelling and reports of gunfire in Gisenyi in January 2025. 

Do not travel to the Rubavu district, including the town of Gisenyi, due to the volatile security situation, which includes the risk of active fighting. If you're in the Rubavu district, you should leave by commercial means if it is safe to do so.

Reconsider your need to travel within 10 km of the rest of Rwanda’s border with DRC, including parts of Rusizi district, as there are risks due to nearby conflict.

If you're in the area, monitor local media for updates, follow the advice of local authorities, arrange effective personal safety measures and ensure your travel documents are up to date.

Don't cross the border into the DRC. We advise do not travel to the DRC. If, despite our advice, you travel to the DRC, review the travel advice for the [DRC](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/democratic-republic-congo).

The land border between Rwanda and Burundi has been closed since 11 January 2024. The border will remain closed until further notice. We advise exercise a high degree of caution within 10km of the border with Burundi as:

* the security environment can change rapidly
* there's a risk of conflict between government forces and rebels in Burundi
* there's a chance of cross-border violence by armed groups, including bandits

Monitor local media and other sources for news that may affect your safety.

#### Violence and crime

Grenade attacks and other violence have occurred in the past, including in Kigali. People have been killed and injured in these attacks.

Targets for attacks have included:

* genocide memorial sites
* markets
* taxi and bus stops

To protect yourself from attacks:

* be alert to any security threats, especially around common targets
* monitor the media and other sources for possible threats
* follow the advice of local authorities

To protect yourself against other crime, avoid walking or travelling after dark. Stay alert during daylight hours.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Avoid protests, rallies and demonstrations. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Volcanoes National Park and Nyungwe Forest

If you're planning to visit the Volcanoes National Park (Parc National des Volcans), book with a reputable travel agent. Only visit the park as part of an organised tour group.

You need permission from the Rwanda Office of Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN) before visiting the park or Nyungwe Forest.

The ORTPN may provide a military escort because of the risk of rebel attack.

#### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime targeting foreigners doesn't happen often. Crimes include:

* bag snatching
* pickpocketing
* robbery

Theft from hotel rooms and vehicles also occurs.

When driving, keep your valuables out of sight. Close the windows and lock the doors.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Severe weather

Rwanda experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* floods and mudslides
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and [volcanoes](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

If there's a natural disaster:

* always carry your passport in a waterproof bag
* keep in touch with family and friends
* check the media and other local sources for information
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Flooding and mudslides

The rainy seasons are from:

* February to May
* September to December

[Flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and mudslides occur throughout Rwanda at these times.

Heavy rain may affect infrastructure and disrupt essential services. This can restrict travel if roads close.

#### Earthquakes and volcanoes

North-western Rwanda is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone. Earthquakes and volcanoes are a threat.

Ask your host or hotel about what to do if there's an earthquake.

After an earthquake:

* expect aftershocks
* prepare for travel delays and to change your plans
* ask your travel agent and tour operators to confirm travel services and accommodation bookings
