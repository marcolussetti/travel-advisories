## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable. If the regional security situation deteriorates again, this may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions at short notice.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities.
* Several terrorist attacks have happened in the wider Gulf region in recent years. Terrorists may target tourist areas and attractions. More attacks could occur. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Qatar has a low crime rate. Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crimes are rare but can happen. Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded places.
* Bank and credit card fraud can occur. Always keep your credit card in sight when shopping.
* Be prepared for extreme weather. From June to September, temperatures can reach over 50˚C. Flash flooding can sometimes happen. Follow the advice of local officials.

### Health

* Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus have been reported in Qatar. Avoid contact with camels and products contaminated with camel secretions.
* Qatar can experience periods of high air pollution. Sand and dust storms can also worsen breathing issues. Talk to your doctor before you travel if you have concerns.
* Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave. If you're staying longer than 30 days in Qatar, you must purchase health insurance from companies approved by the Qatari Ministry of Public Health at a standard cost of 50 Qatari Riyals per month.

### Local laws

* Qatari laws and customs are very different to those in Australia. If you're detained or arrested, ask police or prison officials to inform the Australian Embassy in Doha.
* If you receive a traffic violation, you cannot leave Qatar until you have paid all relevant fines.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences include long jail terms. Authorities can detain and deport you if you carry medication to treat HIV and hepatitis. This can also happen if you test positive for either illness.
* Sex outside of marriage is illegal. If you're the victim of a sexual assault, authorities may arrest, detain or prosecute you for adultery. If you're sexually assaulted in Qatar, ask us for consular help and advice on available support services immediately. Hamad General Hospital provides a [Sexual Assault Service.](https://www.hamad.qa/EN/Hospitals-and-services/Hamad-General-Hospital/Hospital-Services/Clinical-Departments/Pages/Sexual-Assault-Service.aspx)
* Qatar has conservative codes of dress and behaviour. Visitors are expected to cover their shoulders and knees when visiting public places, including museums and other government buildings. If you're at tourist attractions, shopping malls and other public places, check the specific dress codes at the venue or online.
* Avoid commenting on Qatari culture, government policy or services, and commercial enterprises online while in Qatar. This includes reviewing hotel or restaurant experiences on social media. These activities could be considered cybercrime offences in Qatar.

### Travel

* If you're staying longer than 30 days in Qatar, you must purchase health insurance either prior to or when you arrive in Qatar. You must purchase this from companies approved by the [Qatari Ministry of Public Health](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/Pages/Health-Insurance-Scheme.aspx). This mandatory insurance only covers medical treatment in Qatar, not other common issues relating to travel, for example, lost luggage (see 'Full advice/Travel' section).
* You may be asked to show proof of your accommodation for the duration of your stay in Qatar on arrival at Hamad International Airport.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Qatar for the latest details.
* Driving in Qatar can be difficult and dangerous. Make sure you understand local laws and practices. It's illegal to use obscene language or hand gestures in traffic. It's also illegal to drive after drinking any amount of alcohol.
* Many areas of the Gulf are sensitive to security issues and territorial disputes. There's also a risk of [piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy). If you're planning sea travel, refer to the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy reports](http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).
* You may be placed under a travel ban if you're involved in a dispute about (but not limited to) business, labour, employment, fines or civil legal proceedings. This can apply to tourists, visitors, or resident identity card (QID) holders. Travel bans are strictly enforced and can take months or years to resolve.
