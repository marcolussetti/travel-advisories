#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you're staying longer than 30 days in Qatar, you must purchase health insurance from companies approved by the Qatari Ministry of Public Health. This will cost 50 Qatari Riyals per month. Health insurance policies purchased outside Qatar may not meet Qatari entry requirements. For more information see: [Mandatory Health Insurance Scheme](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/derpartments/policyaffairs/hfid/Pages/Health-Insurance-Scheme.aspx).

The mandatory medical insurance required by all visitors to Qatar only covers medical treatment in Qatar, not other common issues relating to travel, for example, lost luggage.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Qatar. Take enough legal medicine for your trip. For more information check the Ministry of Public Health [Guideline of controlled drugs for travellers [PDF 614KB]](https://www.moph.gov.qa/_layouts/15/download.aspx?SourceUrl=/Admin/Lists/PublicationsAttachments/Attachments/201/Guideline-of-Controlled-Drugs-for-Travellers%20-%20English.pdf).

For any medication you're carrying, or that may be detected in your system, carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Get medical documents [authenticated](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") by DFAT in Australia if needed.

#### Health risks

#### Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

Cases of [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)) have been reported in Qatar.

There may be a small risk of contracting MERS via ongoing physical contact with camels. To minimise this risk, avoid consuming raw camel milk, undercooked camel meat, or anything contaminated with camel secretions.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, cough, breathing difficulties or diarrhoea.

#### Air pollution

The level of air pollution in Qatar is high by global standards. Dust storms and sandstorms happen often, which can worsen breathing issues.

If you're concerned about the effects of pollution, or dust and sandstorms, speak to your doctor before leaving Australia.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Public medical facilities in Qatar are comparable to those in Australia.

You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
