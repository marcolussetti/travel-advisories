# Local laws

#### Local law

There are major differences between laws in Australia and Qatar. Behaviour that could be considered offensive or anti-social, but not criminal, in Australia could violate Qatari law.

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're detained or arrested, ask police or prison officials to inform the Australian Embassy in Doha.

To meet Qatari requirements, your Australian documents may need extra legal approval before you can use them overseas. Check the rules with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Qatar](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/164).

#### Traffic offences

From 1 September, if you receive a traffic violation, you cannot leave Qatar through any state border (land, air, and sea) until you have paid all relevant fines through:

* [Metrash2application](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/en/service/metrash2),
* [Ministry of Interior website](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/wps/portal/MOIInternet/MOIHome),
* traffic sections, or
* unified service centres.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include long jail terms. Authorities could charge you with possession if they can detect illegal drugs in your body.

Medications that are available over the counter or by prescription in Australia may be illegal in Qatar.

Authorities can detain and deport you if you carry medication to treat HIV and hepatitis. This can also happen if you test positive to either illness.

Check the status of your medicines with an [embassy or consulate of Qatar](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/164). See [Health](#health)

#### Commercial, civil, family and employment law

There are significant differences between Australia's and Qatar's laws on commercial, civil, family and employment matters.

If you become involved in local family law matters such as divorce, child custody and child support:

* get professional legal advice
* understand your rights and responsibilities under Qatari law

#### Commercial law

If you're involved in a commercial civil dispute, local firms or courts may take your passport.

Authorities can stop you leaving Qatar until the dispute is resolved.

If you owe money, you may be jailed until you settle your debts.

#### Fraud

Authorities can arrest and jail you for fraud if you:

* present a cheque that bounces
* fail to pay bills or fines
* have an overdue personal loan or local credit card or similar

Authorities may detain you when you arrive if you have debts or criminal charges in Qatar. This can happen even if you're only transiting through Qatar.

If you're not a resident of Qatar, you may not get bail for crimes involving fraud.

#### Family law

Child custody laws are based on Islamic law.

#### Employment matters

If you have a job in Qatar, you may require an exit permit from your employer to leave the country.

#### Dual citizenship

Qatar doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national and authorities arrest or detain you, our ability to deliver [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") may be limited. 

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/node/44).

The children of Qatari fathers automatically receive Qatari citizenship at birth. Qatari fathers can stop their children from leaving Qatar.

#### Local customs

There are conservative codes of dress and behaviour in Qatar. Visitors must cover their shoulders and knees when visiting public places like museums and other government buildings. If you plan to visit tourist attractions, shopping malls and other public places, check the specific dress codes. Look for details on display at the venues or on their websites. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.  
  
Avoid commenting on Qatari culture, government policy or services, and commercial enterprises online while in Qatar. This includes reviewing hotel or restaurant experiences on social media. These activities could be considered slanderous or cyber-crime offences in Qatar.

#### Offensive behaviour

Swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts and you can be fined, jailed and/or deported. Take particular care when dealing with the police and other officials.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Qatar. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
