#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian passport holders are entitled to apply for a visa on arrival. The type of visa you need will depend on your country of residence and the purpose of your travel.

You may be asked to show proof of your accommodation for the duration of your stay in Qatar on arrival at Hamad International Airport.

Entry and exit rules can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine regulations, contact:

* [Visas & Immigration (Hamad International Airport)](https://dohahamadairport.com/airport-guide/at-the-airport/visas-immigration)
* the [Embassy of the State of Qatar](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/164)
* the official State of Qatar [Government website](https://hukoomi.gov.qa/en/) (in English)

Qatari authorities won't issue visas in an Australian emergency passport. You can only use an emergency passport to leave or travel through Qatar.

#### Border measures

Transiting through Qatar is permitted if you meet the requirements of your final destination country. There are no additional requirements for transiting passengers, even if you choose to use the transit hotel within the airport. Further information about transiting through Qatar can be found on the webpage for [Hamad International Airport](https://dohahamadairport.com/airport-guide/at-the-airport/transfers) and [Visit Qatar](https://visitqatar.com/intl-en/practical-info/visas/visa-details).

For more information, call 109 from inside Qatar or +974 44069999 from outside Qatar, or contact the nearest [Qatari embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/164).

#### Other formalities

#### Travel bans

You may be placed under a travel ban if you're involved in a dispute about (but not limited to): 

* business
* labour
* employment
* fines

You won't be able to leave the country if you're a tourist, visitor, or resident identity card (QID) holder. 

Travel bans are strictly enforced. They can take months or even years to resolve.

Only Qatari authorities, and in very limited cases your sponsor, can remove travel bans. 

Private Qatari citizens may also initiate travel bans against foreigners.

The government may issue travel bans on people who:

* are charged with criminal offences
* are under investigation
* are involved in financial or labour disputes
* have unpaid debts or who have passed bad cheques
* have unresolved civil legal proceedings

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

The Australian Embassy can't issue a new passport in the airport transit area. If you're in the transit area without a passport, you'll need to return to Australia. In Australia, you'll need to apply for a new passport.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Qatari Riyal (QAR).

Change currency only at commercial banks and official exchange bureaus.

Most businesses that deal with tourists accept international credit cards. ATMs are widely available.

Ask your bank if your cards will work in Qatar.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Qatar with:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before leaving home.

If you hold a residence permit, you'll need a Qatari driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in Qatar. It's challenging and dangerous to drive due to road construction and high speeds.

Visitors or business visa holders with a driver's licence from their home country can drive for up to 15 days from the date of entry into Qatar. You'll need to apply for a temporary Qatar driving licence to extend this.

If you have an international licence, you can drive for up to 6 months from your date of entry into Qatar.

If you have a non-Qatari licence, you can rent a car if you are 25 years or older and have held a valid driving licence for at least 12 months. The availability of rental cars is likely to be low due to the high demand in Qatar.

Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) residents with a GCC driver's licence can drive for up to 3 months from their date of entry into Qatar.

Be careful driving on rural roads. They can be dangerous because of:

* unsafe driving
* drifting sands

Sandstorms and dust storms occur. This can significantly reduce visibility and lead to road accidents.

Rain can cause dangerous road conditions and flash flooding.

It's illegal:

* to drive with any alcohol in your system
* to leave the scene of an accident as a driver until the police tell you to do so

You can only move your vehicle off the road if there are no injuries from the accident.

It's also illegal to use obscene language and hand gestures in traffic. This includes responding to other drivers' poor driving or traffic incidents.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have enough insurance coverage before driving
* check local traffic laws and practices before driving
* drive carefully and legally
* avoid arguments over traffic incidents

If you have an accident, contact the police and stay with your vehicle if it's safe to do so.

#### Sea travel

Many areas of the Gulf are sensitive to security issues and territorial disputes.

Disputes about sea boundaries can occur. There are disagreements about the sea boundaries and control of Abu Musa and Tunbs islands in the Southern Gulf.

Authorities can inspect your vessel and detain or arrest you if you're in sensitive waters.

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") happens in the Gulf.  The [International Maritime Bureau](http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) issues piracy reports on its website.
