# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

There have been several terrorist attacks in the Gulf region in recent years. These have occurred at places visited by foreigners. Take official warnings seriously.

Attacks could occur at any time and could target:

* places of worship
* hotels, restaurants, and bars
* sporting venues
* military sites
* transport hubs
* crowded public places
* other locations foreigners may visit

If there's an attack, leave the affected area straight away if it's safe to.

#### Civil unrest and domestic political tension

Public protests and events that attract large groups of people can occur with little notice.

Conflict in the Middle East and Gulf region could affect Qatar.

To stay safe:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and other large public gatherings as they could turn violent
* be aware of local concerns about regional affairs
* check the news and other sources for details on planned and possible unrest or strikes
* plan your activities to avoid potential unrest
* change your travel plans if needed
* follow the advice of local authorities

If civil unrest disrupts your travel, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Crime

Qatar has a low crime rate.

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crime is rare but can happen. Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded places.

Banking and credit card fraud can occur. Always keep your credit card in sight.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Sexual assault

In Qatar, sex outside marriage is illegal. Police may prosecute you with criminal charges rather than treat you as a victim/survivor if you seek medical help after a sexual assault. Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual. If the court determines sex was consensual, the victim or attacker may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage.

If you choose not to report the sexual assault but seek medical assistance, all medical facilities are legally obliged to report cases of rape and sexual assault, and the results from any examinations to the local police. So even if you choose not to report the crime, the police will be notified.

It is your choice on whether to report to police. If you don’t report it, your case will not be investigated.

If you're sexually assaulted in Qatar, contact the Australian Embassy in Doha on (+974) 4007 8500 or after hours the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra on:

* +61 2 6261 3305 from overseas
* 1300 555 135 from within Australia

Ask for guidance and information on support services, if needed we can help you contact your family and friends.

Consular officers can't provide legal or medical advice. However, they can provide lists of English-speaking service providers who may be able to help you.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes 4WD adventure activities in the desert.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if it's covered by your travel insurance policy
* check that vehicles are well-equipped for the desert
* check that there's enough water, fuel, food provisions and a mobile phone
* ask about, and insist on, minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Always:

* leave a copy of your travel itinerary with friends or relatives
* adjust your plans if the weather makes conditions unsafe
* seek advice from local authorities

* drink plenty of water
* avoid long periods in the heat

Sandstorms and dust storms occur often.
