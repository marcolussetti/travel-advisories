# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

There have been several terrorist attacks in the Gulf region in recent years. These have occurred at places visited by foreigners. Take official warnings seriously.

Attacks could occur at any time and could target:

* places of worship
* hotels, restaurants, and bars
* sporting venues
* military sites
* transport hubs
* crowded public places
* other locations foreigners may visit

If there's an attack, leave the affected area straight away if it's safe to.

#### Civil unrest and domestic political tension

Public protests and events that attract large groups of people can occur with little notice.

Conflict in the Middle East and Gulf region could affect Qatar.

To stay safe:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and other large public gatherings as they could turn violent
* be aware of local concerns about regional affairs
* check the news and other sources for details on planned and possible unrest or strikes
* plan your activities to avoid potential unrest
* change your travel plans if needed
* follow the advice of local authorities

If civil unrest disrupts your travel, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Crime

Qatar has a low crime rate.

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crime is rare but can happen. Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded places.

Banking and credit card fraud can occur. Always keep your credit card in sight.

Unaccompanied women can be vulnerable to harassment. Women should take care when travelling alone, particularly at night. You should pay attention to your immediate surroundings and exercise judgement.

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes 4WD adventure activities in the desert.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if it's covered by your travel insurance policy
* check that vehicles are well-equipped for the desert
* check that there's enough water, fuel, food provisions and a mobile phone
* ask about, and insist on, minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Always:

* leave a copy of your travel itinerary with friends or relatives
* adjust your plans if the weather makes conditions unsafe
* seek advice from local authorities

#### Climate and natural disasters

Qatar often experiences extremely high temperatures. From June to September, the temperature can be higher than 50°C.

To avoid heat stroke and dehydration:

* drink plenty of water
* avoid long periods in the heat

Sandstorms and dust storms occur often.

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"):

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* closely monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with friends and family
