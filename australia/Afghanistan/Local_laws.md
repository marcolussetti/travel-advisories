# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Follow the local laws and regulations.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Death penalty

Afghanistan imposes the death sentence for murder and other serious offences.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail terms and fines.

#### Serious crimes

It's illegal to have:

* a de facto relationship
* close contact between unmarried men and women

These crimes are particularly serious when the relationship is between a non-Muslim and a Muslim.

Severe penalties apply for breaking these laws. Punishments may include imprisonment, lashing and the death penalty.

Same-sex relationships are illegal.

Penalties are severe for other serious crimes, such as:

* non-Islamic preaching
* adultery
* abandoning Islam as a religion

It’s illegal to bring drugs, alcohol or pork products into Afghanistan. If you do, you could be arrested.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

It's a serious criminal offence for an Australian to fight in a foreign state. Penalties include up to 25 years in jail.

#### Local customs

There are conservative codes of dress and behaviour in Afghanistan. This applies to foreigners.  
Women must be accompanied by a male guardian (for instance, a husband, father, brother or son) and must fully cover themselves in public. The Taliban placed restrictions on women's movement outside the home. These restrictions could change at short notice and could prevent you from leaving Afghanistan.

Public displays of affection may offend.

Although there are conflicting reports regarding the enforcement of dress codes, you should consider these announcements and customs when out in public and take care not to offend.   
If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events) is observed in Afghanistan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at all times.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities in front of people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
