# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Follow the local laws and regulations.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Death penalty

Afghanistan imposes the death sentence for murder and other serious offences.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail terms and fines.

#### Serious crimes

It's illegal to have:

* a de facto relationship
* close contact between unmarried men and women
* an LGBTQIA+ relationship

These crimes are particularly serious when the relationship is between a non-Muslim and a Muslim.

Severe penalties apply for breaking these laws. Punishments may include imprisonment, lashing and the death penalty.

Same-sex relationships are illegal.

Penalties are severe for other serious crimes, such as:

* adultery
* non-Islamic preaching
* renouncing Islam as a religion
* blasphemy
* moral crimes

#### Religious Proselytism

Religious proselytism is illegal in Afghanistan. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material. If you convert or try to convert someone from Islam to another religion, you could face harsh punishment, including the death sentence. Individuals practicing a religion other than Islam have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, and physically attacked or abused.

You could be accused of blasphemy if you engage in religious activities that contradict or challenge the Taliban’s extreme interpretation of Islamic teachings and values. Such acts are punishable by lengthy jail sentences and even the death sentence.

#### Other laws

Don't photograph:

* checkpoints
* government buildings
* palaces
* security or military sites, including non-Afghan installations

You could be detained and have your equipment seized. Obey signs prohibiting photography.

It’s illegal to bring drugs, alcohol or pork products into Afghanistan. If you do, you could be arrested. 

It’s illegal to play music in Afghanistan. Musical instruments are confiscated.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

It's a serious criminal offence for an Australian to fight in a foreign state. Penalties include up to 25 years in jail.

#### Local customs

There are conservative codes of dress and behaviour in Afghanistan. This applies to foreigners.

Public displays of affection may offend or be perceived as breaking the law.

The Taliban prohibit women from travelling and going to public places without a male guardian (such as parks and restaurants), looking at unrelated men's body and/or face, accessing higher education, working outside their home, working for non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, having their voices heard in public. Women must fully cover themselves in public.

The Taliban prohibit men from wearing ‘western-style clothing’ such as jeans and are not allowed to shave their beard if it is less than the width of a fist. Men are forbidden from looking at an unrelated woman’s body or face.

These restrictions apply to all Afghans and may be enforced on foreigners. If in doubt, seek local advice.

These restrictions could change at short notice and could prevent you from leaving Afghanistan.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events) is observed in Afghanistan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at all times.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities in front of people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
