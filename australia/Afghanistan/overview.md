# Overview

Latest update

We've reviewed our travel advice and continue to advise do not travel to Afghanistan due to the extremely dangerous security situation and the very high threat of terrorism and kidnapping throughout Afghanistan, including in Kabul.   
  
If, despite our advice, you travel to Afghanistan, there's a very high risk you could be the target of a terrorist attack or kidnapping. There are no guarantees for your safety in Afghanistan. Terrorists continue to target and kidnap foreigners, NGO workers, medical personnel and humanitarian workers. Locations including markets, cafes, restaurants, hotels, medical facilities and humanitarian operations may be targeted. No location in Afghanistan can be considered safe from the threat of attack (see 'Safety').   
  
Foreign nationals, including NGO workers, also face a serious threat of arbitrary detention. Australians have been previously detained. The Taliban are suspicious of foreigners working or travelling in Afghanistan, including NGO workers, and it's likely your work and movements will be closely monitored. There are no Australian officials in Afghanistan, and our ability to provide consular and passport assistance is severely limited.

## Overview

### Safety

* The situation remains volatile and dangerous. Afghanistan is under Taliban control, and several other armed Islamist groups are active in Afghanistan. All travel throughout Afghanistan is extremely dangerous. There are Taliban checkpoints on roads throughout the country, including in Kabul.
* Crossing Afghanistan's land borders can be dangerous. Border crossing points may be closed without notice due to increased border tensions or concerns of an increased risk of a terrorist attack.
* Attacks have occurred in the vicinity of the Kabul International Airport. Airports and aviation remain an attractive target for terrorist attacks.
* You must consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route. The Australian Government can't offer advice on the safety of travelling to departure points. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.
* There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks across the country. Locations including markets, cafes, restaurants, hotels, tourist sites and government buildings, including hospitals, may be targeted. There's a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as Ramadan. See 'Safety' for more details.
* Kidnapping is a serious and ongoing threat. Terrorists and criminal groups target foreigners and dual citizens. NGO aid and humanitarian workers and medical providers are not safe from harassment, the threat of terrorism or kidnapping. Terrorists also continue to target both local and foreign NGO operations across the country and within Kabul, including politically motivated and kidnap-for-ransom abductions. Convoys have been targeted.
* There's a significant risk of arbitrary detention of foreign nationals. Foreign nationals, including aid and humanitarian workers, have been detained. Reasons for detention may be unclear. Detention can be lengthy and damaging to health and welfare. The Australian Government may not be notified about a detention, and our ability to assist is severely limited.
* If, despite our advice, you're in Afghanistan, ensure your accommodation is secure and regularly review your personal security plans. Take all extra precautions for your safety. Make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so.
* There are no Australian consular officials in Afghanistan. Our ability to provide consular and passport assistance is severely limited and can't be delivered in person, nor can we facilitate the delivery of passports into Afghanistan.

### Health

* You'll need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Afghanistan.
* Insect-borne diseases are common. Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases, including polio, are widespread.
* Medical facilities are very limited. Sanitation and hygiene are poor. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation, which may not be possible and can be very expensive.
* Basic health care may be available in major cities but may be completely unavailable in rural areas.

### Local laws

* Afghanistan uses corporal punishment and imposes the death penalty for murder and other serious offences.
* De facto relationships, close contact between unmarried men and women, adultery and same-sex relationships are illegal. Punishments may include imprisonment, lashing and the death penalty.
* Preaching a religion other than Islam and renouncing Islam is illegal.
* Photographing checkpoints, government buildings, palaces, and security or military sites is illegal.
* There are very strict codes of dress and behaviour in Afghanistan. This applies to foreigners. Women must fully cover themselves in public.
* Restrictions apply to women's movement. Women must be accompanied by a male guardian and are expressly prohibited from many places.
* Local application of Taliban edicts can change without notice. Non-compliance can lead to arrest and severe punishment.

### Travel

* We advise against all travel to and within Afghanistan. There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks. All travel throughout Afghanistan, including by road, is extremely dangerous. Violent incidents occur across the country
* Border crossing points may be closed without notice, especially when border tensions are high or there is increased risk of terrorist attack. Border areas, including crossing points, may be targeted by terrorists.
* There are Taliban checkpoints on roads in Kabul and throughout the country. There are unexploded weapons, landmines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on and near roads. Historic munitions may be unearthed by weather events such as floods or landslides.
* Drivers are aggressive, reckless and often drive at excessive speeds. Fatal accidents are common. Road conditions are poor. Seatbelts are often out of order or removed from vehicles entirely.
* You must consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route. The Australian Government can't offer advice on the safety of travelling to departure points. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk. Make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.
* Airport and aviation safety infrastructure may not be maintained to the same standard as in Australia, including emergency response vehicles, weather services and tower communications. Due to safety concerns, Afghan-owned airlines are banned from flying in EU airspace. DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
