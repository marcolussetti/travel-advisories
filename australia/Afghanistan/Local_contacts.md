#### Emergencies

There's no centralised number to reach emergency services.

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

The [Australian Embassy in Kabul](https://afghanistan.embassy.gov.au/) is closed. Our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in Afghanistan is severely limited.

If you have made your way out of Afghanistan and require consular assistance, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

For non-urgent enquiries, including passports, see the [contact page](https://afghanistan.embassy.gov.au/kbul/contact-us.html) on the Australian Embassy Afghanistan website.
