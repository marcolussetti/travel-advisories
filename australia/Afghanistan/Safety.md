# Safety

#### Security situation

Avoid travelling to or within Afghanistan.

The situation in Afghanistan remains volatile and dangerous. There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. Foreigners, including tourists and NGO workers, may be targeted. Attacks could occur at any time and result in casualties.

All travel throughout Afghanistan, including by road, is extremely dangerous. Violent incidents occur across the country. Be aware of the potential for violence and security threats with large crowds. Border crossing points are at risk of a terrorist attack and may close without notice due to an increased risk of attack.

There are Taliban checkpoints on roads throughout the country. The Taliban has increasingly harassed and detained international and local aid and humanitarian workers.

You must consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route. The Australian Government can't offer advice on the safety of travelling to any alternative departure point. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. 

If, despite our advice, you're in Afghanistan, take all extra precautions for your safety. 

* Stay in a safe place and limit your movements.
* Adopt effective personal security measures.
* Always be alert and aware of your surroundings, especially in large crowds.
* Keep a low profile.
* Vary your routines so your movements don't become obvious to others.
* Make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so.
* Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media and credible sources of local information.

The Australian Embassy in Kabul has closed. Our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited. Australians needing consular assistance should contact the Australian Government 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia. Contact the nearest Australian embassy or consulate if you have left Afghanistan and require consular assistance.

#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks throughout Afghanistan, including in Kabul. Attacks can occur anywhere and at any time and may target foreigners. No location in Afghanistan can be considered safe from the threat of attack.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Afghanistan as a tourist, there’s a very high risk you could be the target of a terrorist attack or kidnapping.

Terrorists continue to target NGO, humanitarian operations and hospitals across the country. NGO, aid and humanitarian workers, including medical providers, are not safe from the threat of terrorism. 

Serious, large-scale terrorist incidents frequently happen, including attacks using vehicle-borne, magnetic, or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and firearms. Rocket and mortar attacks also occur.

Attacks resulting in casualties have happened near diplomatic facilities, Kabul International Airport, places of worship, border crossings and other high-profile locations.

There's a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan.

Airports and aviation remain an attractive target for terrorist attacks. Terrorists may attack vehicles travelling along roads in and around Kabul. Terrorist attacks have targeted convoys. Avoid travelling to or within Afghanistan.

Targets of an attack may include:

* places with a high number of security and government personnel, government buildings and military establishments
* cafes, restaurants and hotels
* residential compounds used by foreigners
* embassies
* NGO and international humanitarian facilities and offices
* vehicles of NGOs and humanitarian organisations
* shops and markets
* tourist sites
* border crossing points
* police stations, schools and medical facilities, including hospitals
* places of worship and religious sites.

Terrorists have staged attacks from partly constructed buildings and high rises.

If, despite our advice, you're in Afghanistan:

* stay alert, and be aware of your surroundings, especially in large crowds.
* don't travel at night.
* ensure your accommodation is secure
* review your personal security plans regularly
* make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Afghanistan is a global kidnapping hotspot. There are a high number of recorded incidents.

Westerners, including Australians, have been kidnapped in recent years.

Terrorists and criminal groups continue to look for opportunities to kidnap Westerners, including tourists, throughout Afghanistan, including in Kabul and surrounding districts.

Kidnappers have targeted:

* academics
* journalists
* people working for NGOs
* people working for foreign companies

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Detention

Foreign nationals, including Australians, are at risk of arbitrary detention in Afghanistan. Australians have been previously detained.

The Taliban has also harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers, tourists, and journalists. The Taliban are suspicious of foreigners working or travelling in Afghanistan, including NGO and humanitarian workers and journalists, and it's likely your work and movements will be closely monitored.

Reasons for detention may be unclear. Detention can be lengthy, possibly months or years, and damaging to your health and welfare, with uncertain outcomes. Communication with your next of kin may not be possible.

The Australian Government may not be notified about a detention. Our ability to access information about or assist a detainee is severely limited.

There's an increased risk that the Taliban will suspect you of espionage and may detain you if you're found in possession of:  
·        weapons  
·        explosives  
·        tracking devices  
·        items that may be considered unusual  
·        large quantities of money  
Or if:  
·        you have worked in the military  
·        you have connections to previously detained foreign nationals

If you're found guilty of espionage or working to undermine Afghanistan’s national security, the punishment may be execution.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly. Afghanistan is under Taliban control.

Demonstrations and celebratory gunfire

Demonstrations may happen as a result of the following:

* domestic events
* international events
* political developments in the region

Violent demonstrations happen in areas visited by foreigners.

Attacks could occur anywhere.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid:

* demonstrations
* political rallies
* public gatherings
* minor disputes

If they escalate, people could be killed or injured.

If you're in Afghanistan and you're in an area affected by civil unrest:

* find a safe location
* stay indoors
* monitor local media for updates

#### Crime

There's a high level of serious crime, including:

* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344)
* rape
* carjacking

Many people carry weapons.

Lawlessness exists in rural areas. Armed bandits and kidnappings by armed groups are common.

If you're in Afghanistan:

* stay indoors after dark
* make sure your communications equipment is always working

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Afghanistan is in an active [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/345) zone. Earthquakes in recent years have caused heavy casualties and significant damage to homes and infrastructure.

Some mountainous areas experience deadly winter avalanches and heavy snow.

Follow the advice of local authorities.
