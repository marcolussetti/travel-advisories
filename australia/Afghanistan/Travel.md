#### Visas and border measures

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. If, despite our advice you travel to Afghanistan, ensure you meet all entry and exit conditions.

Not all Afghan Embassies abroad are able to issue valid travel documents. Check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering. If you don't meet the conditions, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### Passport

#### Limited services

Our ability to provide any passport services to Australians in Afghanistan is severely limited. We can't facilitate the delivery of passports into Afghanistan.

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is valuable. It may be attractive to criminals who try to use your identity to commit crimes. Always keep it in a safe place.

We can't facilitate the delivery of passports into Afghanistan.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Afghani (AFN). It is illegal to bring foreign currency into Afghanistan.

There are very few ATMs in Kabul.

Businesses don't widely accept credit cards and are unlikely to accept travellers' cheques.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

We advise against all travel to and within Afghanistan. All travel throughout Afghanistan, including by road, is extremely dangerous. Violent incidents occur across the country. Border crossing points may be closed without notice, especially when crowds gather or where there are concerns of an increased risk of attack. Border crossing points are at risk of terrorist attack. There are Taliban checkpoints on roads in Kabul and throughout the country.

* Avoid travelling in Afghanistan. But if you do, seek professional security advice.
* Take all extra precautions for your safety.
* Remain vigilant and be aware of your surroundings.
* Review your personal security plans regularly.
* Drivers are aggressive, reckless and often drive at excessive speeds.
* Road conditions are poor
* Fatal road accidents are common.

The Australian Government can't offer advice on the safety of travelling to departure points. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk. 

You must consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route. Make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

Unexploded remnants of war, including landmines and IEDs, are a danger across the country, including on:

* roads
* the areas next to roads

#### Air travel

Airport and aviation safety infrastructure may not be maintained to the same standard as in Australia, including aircraft, emergency response vehicles, weather services and tower communications.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Research your aviation provider before choosing their services.

You're encouraged to read [Air travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/air-travel) before flying.

Check [Afghanistan's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YA) with the Aviation Safety Network.

Be alert to anyone attempting to get payments from travellers illegally. They may attempt to do this by withholding your passport.
