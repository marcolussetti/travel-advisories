# Health

#### Travel insurance

You’ll need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Afghanistan. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

#### Physical and mental health

If, despite our advice, you travel to Afghanistan, consider your physical and mental health beforehand, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) outbreaks can occur between April and September. Chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria are in some areas.

Other insect-borne diseases, including [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis), are common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/348) are widespread, including:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [leptospirosis](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-leptospirosis-fs.htm)
* [pertussis (whooping cough)](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/pertussis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Polio

[Polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) is present in Afghanistan.

In August 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed wild polio as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. The WHO has extended its [temporary polio recommendations](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/14th-ihr-polio/en/). These may affect your travel to Afghanistan.

#### Air pollution

Household air pollution is an environmental health risk in Afghanistan. There's a higher risk during winter.

To reduce your exposure, take precautions when increased levels are recorded.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are very limited, and the standard of training for medical staff is poor. There is no guarantee local health practitioners will be available. Sanitation and hygiene are poor.

There is no public ambulance service in Afghanistan, including Kabul. If you need urgent attention, speak directly with a local medical practitioner and use local transport to get to hospital when it's safe to. Ambulances sent by hospitals may require payment or evidence of insurance before they treat you.

You'll need to be evacuated if you get seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation may not be possible and can be very expensive. Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Afghanistan.
