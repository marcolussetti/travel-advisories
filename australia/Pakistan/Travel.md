#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You'll need to get a visa in advance to enter Pakistan. See the [Pakistan Online Visa System](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/) for information. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest Pakistani embassy or consulate for the latest details. You will need to apply for a visa prior to arrival if travelling for diplomatic or official purposes.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Pakistan High Commission](http://www.pakistan.org.au/) for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

To exit Pakistan, you must have either:

* a valid visa
* a Pakistani national identity card
* a valid Pakistani passport

Authorities may stop you from boarding your flight if your visa has expired. You could also face heavy penalties, including fines and detention.

Take care not to overstay your visa.

If your visa has expired, contact the [Ministry of Interior](https://www.interior.gov.pk/) for an exit permit.

Illegal entry into Pakistan is an offence and subject to deportation or imprisonment. There is currently no process for regularisation of status for illegal entrants, which is necessary for onward travel.

#### Border measures

You're required to complete a Health Declaration Form on arrival, and you could be screened for Mpox symptoms. This is in response to the global spread of Mpox. Monitor your health closely and follow the advice of local authorities. The current policies for travellers entering Pakistan can be found on [Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.caapakistan.com.pk/) website.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Pakistan from a country with yellow fever.

#### Travel with children

If a child travels unaccompanied, or with only one parent or guardian, local immigration authorities may ask for either:

* documents to prove that the children have consent to travel, or
* proof of parental responsibility

This is particularly the case if the child is of Pakistani origin.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for at least 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Dual passport holders

If you're a dual national and hold a Pakistani passport, seek advice about when to use it.

Use your Australian passport to leave from and return to Australia.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Pakistan Rupee (PKR).

US dollars and euros are the most accessible currencies to change.

ATMs are widely available in urban areas, though fraud occurs.

International hotels and some shops in major centres accept credit cards.

Pakistan is primarily a cash-based society, but this is changing with the broader acceptance of credit and debit cards in major centres. Arrange to have enough local currency to meet your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Pakistan, you need both:

* an Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

You can apply for a local driver's licence if you're a long-term resident. To apply, you have to take a road sign test and provide:

* a supporting letter from your employer
* a copy of your passport, which must be valid for at least 6 months
* a copy of your Australian driver's licence
* a medical fitness certificate from a government hospital in Pakistan
* Pakistan visa valid for at least 6 months
* proof of residency

#### Road travel

Road travel in Pakistan is hazardous.

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Pakistan than in Australia. Road accidents are a common cause of death and injury.

Hazards include bad roads and poor driving standards.

Severe flooding of major waterways can occur. This causes widespread damage to transport infrastructure.

Dense fog in central and northern Pakistan during the winter months can disrupt road travel. Motorways may close until the fog lifts.

Heavy snowfalls in mountain regions cause road blockages each winter. Leading to lengthy and, at times, dangerous traffic jams. This is due to the combination of snow and:

* many cars visiting mountain areas are ill-equipped for driving in snow
* too many vehicles on narrow winding roads
* lack of snow-clearing equipment
* no traffic management

Check you have the right insurance cover before driving.

To reduce your risk on the road:

* learn about local traffic laws and practices
* avoid road travel after dark
* seek local advice and monitor local media and weather reports for information on your planned route before you travel

#### Motorcycles

Check your insurance policy covers using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Don't use taxis due to security and safety concerns. Never hail a taxi on the street.

Use transport services from accredited tour operators, car hire businesses (who provide a driver) and hotels.

Australian High Commission staff must not use taxis or other ride-sharing services.

#### Public transport

Avoid using public transport due to frequent accidents and security concerns. This includes buses and trains.

Only use transport services provided by accredited tour operators, car hire businesses, and hotels.

#### Air travel

Terrorists have targeted Pakistan's civil aviation facilities.

There are strict security measures in place at airports, but attacks could occur in the future.

Flights can be cancelled with little warning due to weather and other operational reasons.

Dense fog, especially in central and northern Pakistan during the winter months, can also disrupt air travel. Airports may close until the fog lifts.

If you plan to fly within Pakistan:

* check flight status and airport operations before you travel
* contact your travel agent and airline about any disruptions to transport services
* be alert to security developments
* allow extra time to pass through airport security

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Pakistan's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=AP) with the Aviation Safety Network.
