# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty.

Penalties for small amounts of drugs include:

* long jail sentences
* large fines
* deportation

#### Family laws

Domestic violence against women, from partners or male relatives, is common in Pakistan. Standards of support services, including legal and police protection for those affected by domestic violence, are far lower than similar services available in Australia. You should consider these risks if you're planning to travel to Pakistan.

Australian parents of Pakistani origin, especially women, sometimes have trouble leaving Pakistan with their children. This happens when one parent refuses to let the children return to Australia. If that parent withholds the children's passports, the other parent can't bring the children back to Australia. Plan carefully if you think this could happen to you. Before you leave Australia:

* think about the risk of not being able to return to Australia with your children
* speak to a lawyer to identify and resolve any child custody or other family law issues
* make sure you know your legal rights and limits on those rights

#### Serious crime

The death penalty can apply to crimes including terrorism, murder, rape, blasphemy and unlawful assembly.

Those charged with blasphemy can spend years in prison, undergo lengthy trial processes and are in constant danger from members of the public or prisoners. Australians who have made public comments, including on social media that may be construed as blasphemous should not travel to Pakistan.

#### Other laws

Activities that are illegal in Pakistan include:

* same-sex sexual acts
* unmarried heterosexual couples living together
* importing alcohol
* importing pork products
* taking photos of airports, military or government buildings or installations
* flying unregistered drones

Be particularly careful to avoid raising religious sensitivities. It's illegal to:

* try to convert a Muslim
* encourage a Muslim to abandon their religion

Capital punishment, while rare, is a penalty available to courts under the penal code.

#### Kite flying

Do not bring kites with you or fly kites in Pakistan.

Some provinces have banned kite-flying due to fortified kite strings that injure or kill people. There's also a ban on the sale of kite equipment and the use of premises to fly kites.

These types of strings are used for flying kites in kite-fighting competitions. Competitors coat their kite strings with metal, crushed glass or chemicals to help cut opponents' kite strings. These strings can fall across roads, cutting motorcycle riders' throats or contact power lines, causing electrocution.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Pakistan recognises dual citizenship.

If you or your father were born in Pakistan, authorities may consider you to be a Pakistani national. This applies even if you don't hold a Pakistani passport.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/node/117) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

There are strong Islamic codes of dress and behaviour in Pakistan.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice. Also:

* avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless clothes
* avoid physical contact between men and women in public

#### Ramadan (Ramazan in Urdu)

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Pakistan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws, particularly at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
