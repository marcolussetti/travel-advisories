#### Terrorism

Terrorist and separatist groups hostile to domestic and foreign interests operate in Pakistan. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Counter-terrorism operations occur across the country.   
  
The threat of attack remains very high, especially in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces, which suffer regular and sometimes large-scale terrorist attacks. If you travel to Pakistan, you should remain cautious and vigilant, including in major cities.

Reporting continues to identify the potential for attacks in Islamabad. In response, heightened security arrangements are in place, including an increased security force presence and additional checkpoints. Terrorists may also target places frequented by foreigners, transport infrastructure (including trains and airports) and places of worship. Australian officials in Islamabad have been advised to maintain vigilance.

Previous attacks have included the use of grenades, firearms, and bombing, including suicide bombs. Some terrorist attacks in Pakistan have involved multiple explosions, one after the other, combined with small-arms fire.

Security officials may cut mobile phone services and internet communications when the threat of an attack is imminent or directly after an incident.

If you go to Chitral district or Gilgit Baltistan, travel by commercial aircraft, not by road, as the safety and security risks are significant.

In the past, terror attacks have targeted Pakistan's government, military and police, including:

* buildings and government symbols
* military and security forces
* judicial buildings such as courts
* police stations and checkpoints

Terror attacks have also targeted:

* international hotels
* embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic interests
* places of worship, such as mosques, shrines, and churches
* shopping centres, banks, hospitals, cinemas, markets (markaz) and bazaars
* humanitarian workers
* foreign aid agencies
* hikers
* schools
* public transport and transport infrastructure, including trains and airports
* religious sites and processions, especially during religious festivals
* demonstrations and political events
* rallies and polling stations during elections

Terrorists may target places associated with foreigners, including:

* tourist areas
* clubs, restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets and other places foreigners tend to visit
* foreign businesses and other Western symbols
* foreign non-government organisations (NGOs)
* universities and international schools
* convention centres, outdoor sporting and recreation events

#### Times when attacks may occur

Militants may mount attacks in the days leading up to and on days of national or commemorative significance. These include:

* Pakistan National Day (23 March)
* the storming of the Red Mosque in Islamabad by government troops (10 July)
* the Islamic month of Muharram (particularly on the Day of Ashura)
* Independence Day (14 August)

#### Diplomatic security measures

Terrorist and separatist groups hostile to domestic and foreign interests operate in Pakistan. The threat of attack remains very high. Australian officials in Pakistan always use enhanced security measures and are urged to maintain vigilance. The Australian Government has a 'no children at post' policy for Pakistan.

The Australian Government has also advised staff to:

* limit restaurant use
* not linger in shopping areas
* be cautious when walking in Islamabad

For the same reasons, the British High Commission and the US Embassy sometimes restrict the movement of their staff in Pakistan.

These restrictions may be applied at short notice. Areas put 'out of bounds' tend to include markets, shopping centres, restaurants and hotels.

#### Staying safe

Ensure you have a security plan in place. Make sure tour providers have security measures in place before you travel.

Ask about safety from local business partners and universities before travelling to Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi for business or academic reasons. Take security precautions.

If, despite the risks, you travel to Pakistan, be very cautious and avoid:

* public gatherings
* crowded places
* places of worship
* places that foreigners tend to go
* other places terrorists tend to target

When you plan your activities, receive updates on the level of security at venues and your route to them.

* Wherever you go, have a clear exit plan in case there's a security incident or attack.
* leave the area straight away if it's safe to do so and avoid the affected area straight after the attack, because of the risk of secondary attacks
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime.

The overall kidnapping risk in Pakistan is high and is especially high in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Criminal gangs, armed groups and terrorist groups are known to kidnap for financial gain.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel, and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Pakistan is volatile. It could get worse at short notice. Political protests and demonstrations occur frequently and can escalate quickly.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests in Pakistan can turn violent quickly, particularly during election periods or in response to Quran burnings overseas. Avoid large groups of people, demonstrations and protests. The security situation is evolving and remains unpredictable. Major roads, including to the Islamabad International Airport, could be disrupted at short notice. Monitor media for information on the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.

In response, authorities may suspend internet and mobile phone networks and close roads and highways at short notice.

To stay safe during a period of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations and large-scale public gatherings
* avoid areas where people congregate after Friday prayers
* monitor the media and other sources for possible unrest and avoid those areas
* if you're near an affected area, find a safe place, stay indoors and seek local advice
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Violence in Karachi

Political, sectarian and gang violence often occurs in Karachi. While attacks typically occur in Baldia Town, Orangi Town, Lyari, PIB Colony, Saddar and Qasba areas of Karachi, reprisal attacks by militants or criminals or security force operations can occur anywhere. Targeted bombings have also occurred.

There's a higher level of public security across much of the city, with police and paramilitary rangers conducting counter-terrorism operations in the city from time to time.

#### Border with Afghanistan

Cross-border tensions increase security risks in the regions bordering Afghanistan.

The Pakistani military has ongoing operations in these border areas.

Foreigners are prohibited from travelling within 50km of the border with Afghanistan in Gilgit Baltistan. However, it is legal to cross the border at official crossings.

Attacks against government, security and military interests in Balochistan regularly occur. Attacks are also likely against infrastructure for:

* oil and natural gas
* power
* communications
* transport, including the railway network

If you go to Chitral district or Gilgit Baltistan, travel by commercial aircraft, not by road, as the safety and security risks are significant.

#### Border with India

There is an ever-present risk of rising tensions between Pakistan and India over the disputed region of Kashmir.

If tensions between Pakistan and India rise again, airspace restrictions may be imposed with little or no warning. This may impact an airline's ability to operate flights and your ability to leave the country quickly.

Higher security is in place where Pakistan borders India. This reflects the volatile security situation.

Foreigners are prohibited from travelling within 15km of the Kashmir Line of Control and the entire border with India. However, it is legal to cross the border at official crossings.

The Wagah border crossing is closed until further notice. 

The situation is more stable in the border region cities of:

* Lahore
* Wagah
* Kasur
* Narowal
* Sialkot

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime occurs in many parts of Pakistan, particularly in major cities. This includes:

* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* carjacking
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

Incidents can increase around major religious holidays.

Incidents have occurred with people posing as police officers with fake police ID cards. This has occurred in cities across Pakistan, including Islamabad.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common. It can include pickpocketing and theft of mobile phones.

Sexual harassment of women occurs, particularly when women are travelling alone.

#### Gunfire

Be aware of celebratory gun fire (firing guns into the air in celebration). Although illegal, it's common across Pakistan and tends to occur on major holidays, at weddings, other celebrations and following sporting victories. Falling or ricocheted bullets and spent cartridges can cause injury or death.

#### Staying safe

Be alert to your surroundings. Pay attention to your safety and security and:

* keep car doors locked, windows up, and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* lock your accommodation doors and windows against intruders

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Carefully consider the risks before commenting on local political events on your social media. Don't assume that tolerance levels for acceptable comments or debates are the same as in Australia, particularly on social or political topical issues. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Pakistan experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* floods
* landslides and avalanches
* [cyclones](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* [tsunamis](/node/346)

The [Pakistan Meteorological Department](http://pmd.gov.pk/) offers weather warnings.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local media
* register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep friends and family up to date about your welfare

#### Flooding and landslides

The monsoon season is from July to September. During this time, flooding and landslides can occur. They can happen with little warning.

During floods, fresh drinking water and food can be in short supply.

There's still a risk of contracting a waterborne disease after flood waters recede.

Floods often hinder services and transport.

#### Avalanches

Avalanches and glacial lake outbursts occur in mountainous regions of Pakistan and have killed people in recent years. When you're travelling in these areas, monitor local weather and safety conditions, particularly during severe weather and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Cyclones

Cyclones and storms can disrupt key services, including:

* emergency and medical care
* telecommunications
* transport
* food and water supplies

If there's a cyclone or storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Pakistan is in an active seismic zone and experiences [earthquakes](/node/345).

Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis. Be alert to warnings. A tsunami could quickly follow a tremor or earthquake.

If near the coast, move to high ground straight away if:

* local authorities advise you to
* you feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* you feel a weak rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* you see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* you hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media and weather services.
