#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuations and repatriation of remains in case of death. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care. You cannot be assured that treatment will be the same as received in Australia.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Pakistan. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Typhoid fever

To reduce your risks of contracting [typhoid](https://www.who.int/health-topics/typhoid#tab=tab_1):

* ask your doctor about getting vaccinated
* take care to avoid anyone who's sick or has recently been sick

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is common in Pakistan, except in areas above 2,000m. Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant strains of malaria have been reported.

Other insect-borne diseases occur, including:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis)
* [Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever#tab=tab_1)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. In late 2019, there was a severe outbreak of dengue.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is mosquito-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is common. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.

Many Pakistanis, including children, have recently been reported as HIV+ in interior areas of Sindh Province.

#### Polio

[Polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) is endemic. An increase in polio cases has been reported, and the World Health Organization ([WHO](https://www.who.int/)) has noted an upward trend in polio cases since mid-2023.

Before you travel, make sure your polio vaccinations are up to date. This includes getting a booster dose, as per the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/). Carry evidence of your polio vaccination.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is endemic in Pakistan. Stray dog bites cause most infections. There are thousands of cases of dog bites and deaths by rabies each year. Avoid contact with stray dogs. If you're planning an extended stay or work assignments in remote or rural areas, we recommend you have pre-exposure rabies vaccinations before travelling to Pakistan.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. They include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)
* [Mpox](https://www.cdc.gov.au/topics/mpox-monkeypox)(Australian Government)

More severe outbreaks occur from time to time.

There have been periodic reports of [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) cases in Sindh.

Reports of skin infections, acute diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections usually increase after flooding.

Some bottled water may be contaminated. The [Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources](https://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/) produces reports that list safe and unsafe bottled water brand names. Reports are available under the publications and information tab.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids that are [listed as safe](https://pcrwr.gov.pk/bottled-water/)
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Air pollution

Air pollution is an environmental health risk in Pakistan. The risk is higher during winter, particularly in much of Punjab.

Take precautions when increased levels are recorded.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities at a small number of clinics and hospitals in major cities are reasonable but not to Australian standards. Facilities are extremely limited in most towns and rural and remote areas.

Before they'll admit you, hospitals in Pakistan usually require you to either:

* pay up-front
* confirm insurance cover
* guarantee payment

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to evacuate to somewhere with more suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

If you have an accident while hiking or undertaking other adventure activities in the north of Pakistan, medical evacuation can take days and requires your insurance company to guarantee the payment of the flights.
