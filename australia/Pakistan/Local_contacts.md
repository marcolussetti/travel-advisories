#### Visiting the High Commission

The Australian High Commission is in the diplomatic enclave.

The Pakistani Government restricts access to the diplomatic enclave in Islamabad for security reasons.

You can only access the enclave if you first schedule an appointment with the High Commission.

If you have an appointment, you can access the enclave by using the Diplomatic Shuttle Service (DSS). You can also visit using a private vehicle or on foot.

#### Visiting by shuttle bus

The DSS office and bus station is on the corner of Third Avenue (Quaid-e-Azam University Road) and Murree Road.

You can buy bus tickets at the DSS office.

Arrive at the shuttle bus station at least one hour before your appointment to allow time for security checks.

Find out more about the DSS by calling +92 (0) 333 520 5334.

#### Visiting by car or on foot

To enter the enclave by car or on foot, the Diplomatic Protection Department needs to clear you in advance.

Arrange this clearance through the [Australian High Commission](http://pakistan.highcommission.gov.au/islm/aboutus.html).

Once you get entry clearance, you can enter the enclave by vehicle or on foot from either:

* the Foreign Office gate entrance on Constitution Avenue
* the Shams gate entrance on Ispahani Road
