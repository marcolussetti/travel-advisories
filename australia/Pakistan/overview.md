## Overview

### Safety

* Following recent tensions the airspace in Pakistan has reopened. Continue to monitor the situation as disruptions may continue. Check with your airline before proceeding to the airport.
* Always be alert to possible threats near the Atari-Wagah border crossing. The Attari Border remains closed.
* Terrorist and separatist groups hostile to domestic and foreign interests operate in Pakistan. The threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping remains very high. Foreigners may be targeted. Do not travel to Balochistan or Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including Parachinar (except the Chitral, Abbottabad and Haripur districts). The risk of attack is highest in these locations. If you travel to other parts of Pakistan, be cautious, including in major cities where attacks can and have occurred. Avoid crowded places and possible targets. Always have an exit plan.
* Frequent and large-scale demonstrations and protests can occur. Protests can turn violent quickly. Avoid large groups of people, demonstrations and protests. The security situation is evolving and remains unpredictable. Major roads, including to the Islamabad International Airport, could be disrupted at short notice. Monitor media for information on the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.
* Reports continue to identify the potential for attacks in Islamabad. In response, heightened security arrangements are in place, including increased security forces, additional checkpoints and temporary road closures. Terrorists may also target places frequented by foreigners, transport infrastructure, including trains and airports, and places of worship. Australian officials in Islamabad have been advised to maintain vigilance. You should exercise heightened vigilance, review your personal security plans and monitor the media for the latest updates.
* Violent crime, including armed robbery, assault, carjacking and kidnapping, occurs across Pakistan. The risk of kidnapping is very high in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, including Parachinar. If you travel to these areas, get professional security advice. If you must go to the Chitral district or Gilgit Baltistan, travel by commercial aircraft and not by road.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.  See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying)
* Political protest action has increased in recent months. This can impact travel and can turn violent. Religious protests are common. Political, sectarian and gang violence often occurs in Karachi. Avoid large public gatherings. If you're caught in a rally, find a safe place and stay indoors. There has been an increase in conflict across Kurram district in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, including in Parachinar.
* The Afghanistan border area is volatile. The Government of Pakistan does not allow foreigners to travel within 50km of the Afghanistan border in Gilgit Baltistan or within 15km of the Kashmir Line of Control or the entire border with India except at official crossings. The Wagah border crossing is closed until further notice. If you're in an area close to the border, consider leaving.
* Firing guns into the air in celebration is illegal but common. People have died as a result. Be careful of celebratory gunfire, especially around major holidays, weddings, celebrations and after sporting victories.
* Earthquakes are common. Flooding, landslides and tsunamis can occur. Some areas of Pakistan experience extreme heat, with temperatures recorded above 50 degrees Celsius. The risk of disease can increase during the monsoon season (July to September). Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, occur. Drug-resistant strains of malaria have been reported. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider getting vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis.
* HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Polio is endemic. There has recently been an increase in reported cases. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date. Carry evidence of your polio vaccination.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are prevalent. They include typhoid, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and measles. Drink only boiled or bottled water listed as 'safe' by the [Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources](https://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/). Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Facilities at some clinics and hospitals in major cities are reasonable but not to Australian standards. Medical facilities are extremely limited in most towns and rural and remote areas. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty, large fines and lengthy prison sentences.
* Domestic violence against women is common in Pakistan. Standards of domestic violence support are far lower than similar services available in Australia. You should consider these risks if you're planning to travel to Pakistan.
* Capital punishment, while rare, is a penalty available to courts under the penal code. Be aware of religious sensitivities. It's illegal to import alcohol or pork products. It's illegal to try to convert a Muslim or encourage them to abandon their religion.
* Same-sex relations are illegal. It's also illegal for unmarried heterosexual couples to live together.
* Blasphemy can attract the death penalty. Those charged with blasphemy can spend years in prison, undergo lengthy trial processes and are in constant danger from members of the public or prisoners. If you have made public comments, including on social media, that may be construed as blasphemous, you should not travel to Pakistan.
* Strong Islamic codes of dress and behaviour exist in Pakistan. Avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless clothes. If you visit a mosque, your arms, legs, and head (for women) must be covered. Avoid physical contact between men and women in public. Women may be harassed, especially if they're alone.
