#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in Vanuatu. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

You'll find pharmacies in urban centres or at local clinics. They normally only open during business hours. A few urban pharmacies may open on Sunday or public holidays.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Vanuatu. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect born diseases such as [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis) and [zika virus](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/health-topics/zika) are a risk in Vanuatu, especially in warmer and wetter months. 

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs in some areas of Vanuatu, particularly in the north. Consider taking medication to prevent malaria if you plan to travel to affected areas. Discuss options with your doctor.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to zika-affected areas

To protect yourself from disease:​​

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, a rash, diarrhoea or a severe headache.

#### Other infectious risks

* [rubella](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rubella)
* [mumps](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/mumps)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles)
* [diphtheria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diphtheria)
* [pertussis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/pertussis/en/) (whooping cough)
* [varicella](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/chickenpox) (chickenpox)

Discuss options with your doctor if:

* your vaccinations aren't up to date
* you're travelling with children or babies who haven't finished their recommended vaccinations

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases can occur in Vanuatu. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [leptospirosis](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-leptospirosis-fs.htm)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [sexually transmitted infections](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis))

Tap water in the major urban centres of Port Vila, and Luganville is generally safe to drink. Water may be affected following cyclones, heavy rain or volcanic ash fall.

To protect yourself from illness:

* avoid raw or undercooked food, such as salads
* outside of Port Vila and Luganville, drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes

See a doctor if you develop a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Fish poisoning

Eating reef fish can result in [ciguatera poisoning](http://disease-control.health.qld.gov.au/Condition/731/ciguatera-poisoning). Ciguatera is a naturally occurring seafood toxin.

Get urgent medical help if you suspect poisoning.

#### Medical care

Hospital and medical facilities in Vanuatu are limited.

Costs for treatment, including medication, can be high. Doctors and hospitals often require immediate cash payments.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation is expensive and difficult to organise.

The only hyperbaric chamber in Vanuatu is in Port Vila. Many popular dive sites are located on other islands.

If you're in a diving accident, it may take hours or days to reach the necessary medical facilities. The standard of rescue and emergency services is not as high as in Australia.
