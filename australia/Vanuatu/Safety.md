# Safety

#### Climate and natural disasters

There's widespread infrastructure damage, including to roads and buildings, following the 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Port Vila and surrounding areas on 17 December. The CBD remains closed for safety reasons, while assessments and demolition of damaged buildings are underway. 

Landslides have occurred, with the worst affected areas blocked off, including to Port Vila's cruise ship terminal. Follow the advice of local authorities. Essential services, including telecommunications power and water supply, have been restored in most areas.

#### Earthquakes

Earthquakes occur regularly in Vanuatu. Minor tremors, under a magnitude of 4.0, are very common and usually have minimal impact on people and property.

Extreme shaking from major earthquakes above a magnitude of 6.0, can:

* cause tsunamis
* cause landslides and mudslides
* collapse buildings
* break gas and water lines, underground and in buildings
* knock down electricity lines

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can occur in Vanuatu and are caused by strong and sudden movement in the ocean. This usually happens when there's an undersea [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis), landslide, or volcanic eruption.

A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake. It can also occur if no earthquake is felt.

Vanuatu has tsunami warning sirens in Port Vila and Luganville. If you hear tsunami warning sirens or feel a long or strong tremor (lasts more than a minute or makes it hard to stand up). You should:

* move to high ground or as far inland as possible, if you are near the coast or in a low-lying area
* follow the advice of local authorities ([Vanuatu Natural Disaster Management Office](https://ndmo.gov.vu/) and the [Vanuatu Meteorological and Geo-Hazards Department](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php)).

You can follow:

#### Tropical Cyclones Judy, Kevin and Lola

Vanuatu continues to recover from the impacts of Cyclones Judy, Kevin and Lola in 2023, which caused widespread damage. There still may be disruptions to infrastructure, services and telecommunications in some locations.

#### Tropical storms and cyclones

The cyclone season is from November to April, but cyclones and tropical storms can occur at any time. They can disrupt essential services and cause property damage, injuries, and loss of life. The direction and strength of a tropical cyclone can change suddenly. Cyclones can bring:

* torrential rains
* storm surges
* flash flooding
* winds up to 300km/h

Unlike earthquakes, there will be a reasonable warning period before a cyclone, which allows time to prepare. The [Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office](https://ndmo.gov.vu/) has a [colour-coded cyclone alert system](https://ndmo.gov.vu/fr/community/cyclone-awareness/109-colour-alerts)that includes safety procedures to follow during a cyclone.

If a cyclone or tropical storm occurs:

* you may get stuck where you are
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* the storm may affect access to seaports
* safe shelter may not be available

To prepare for a cyclone or tropical storm:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel, cruise ship, or other accommodation
* identify your local shelter
* follow the instructions of local authorities

Monitor advice from the [Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office](https://ndmo.gov.vu/) and the [Vanuatu Meteorological and Geo-Hazards Department​](http://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php).

#### Flooding

Flooding can occur in Vanuatu during and after cyclones and severe rain events, including:

* flash floods - from heavy rains, and overflowing/burst dams
* river floods - often from seasonal rains or severe rain events
* coastal floods - from tsunamis, storm surges and severe weather events such as cyclones

If flooding occurs:

* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Volcanoes

Vanuatu has several active volcanoes, including several under-sea volcanoes. Volcanoes are active on the islands of:

* Tanna
* Ambae
* Ambrym
* Lopevi
* Vanua Lava
* Gaua

Visiting an active volcano can be dangerous.

Pay attention to alerts. Alert levels go from 0 (normal, low-level activity) to 5 (very large eruption, island-wide danger).

A Level 3 alert triggers warnings to avoid the volcano summit and nearby areas. Even at lower levels, explosions and injuries from volcanic debris are possible.

Alert levels and access to volcanoes can change quickly. Before traveling to volcanic areas, visit the[Vanuatu Meteorological and Geo-Hazards Department](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php) website for the latest volcanic activity advice. If there is a volcanic eruption:

* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Crime against travellers in Vanuatu is rare.

However, travellers and foreign residents have been [robbed](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery), [assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted) and [sexually assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault) in Vanuatu.

The risk of violent crime is higher:

* after dark
* in isolated places
* when you're alone

Crime in Vanuatu tends to increase on weekends and in the weeks leading up to holidays, such as Easter, [Christmas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events) and Independence Day (30 July).

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour
* be aware of opportunistic theft. Secure belongings in locked luggage or hotel safe when unattended.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest isn't common in Vanuatu. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people have on occasion turned violent.

To protect yourself during any periods of unrest:

* avoid large crowds and big public gatherings
* monitor local media for possible unrest, protest locations or roadblocks
* follow the advice of local authorities

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest")

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Following an incident involving a domestic charter flight, Australian High Commission staff have been advised not to use Air Taxi Vanuatu until further notice.

Not all tour operators follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts.

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
