# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). However, we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, even small amounts, include fines and imprisonment.

#### Obscene publications

It's illegal to import, possess, distribute, display or produce obscene publications. The rules about what is obscene are stricter than in Australia. Penalties include prison sentences.

#### Alcohol sales

Selling alcohol in supermarkets and similar outlets between midday Saturday and 7am Monday is illegal.

During these times, alcohol may still be served at clubs, bars and hotels.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Vanuatu recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we canÂ provide if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
