#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You can get a 30-day visa when you arrive, if you're both:

* visiting as a tourist, and
* arriving via President Nicolau Lobato International Airport or Dili Seaport

You have to pay for a visa on arrival in US dollars. There are no money exchange facilities at the airport.

If you enter at another location or by land, you need to get a visa before you arrive.

If you can give a valid reason for extending your stay past 30 days, immigration authorities may let you extend your visa.

Apply to the [Immigration Department](http://migracao.gov.tl/) at Vila Verde in Dili to extend your visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/198) or [Timor-Leste Immigration](mailto:informacao@migracao.gov.tl) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the US Dollar (USD).

It is advised that you enter Timor-Leste with USD. Only visa cards are accepted in Timor-Leste, including ATM withdrawals, and they are not widely accepted for transactions. ATMs are available in built-up areas. Occasionally, mainly around national holidays, ATMs may only be restocked occasionally. Ensure you plan your cash needs to account for this.

Declare all amounts higher than $US5,000 or equivalent when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You need approval from the Central Bank of Timor-Leste (CBTL) to import or export more than $US10,000.

It's illegal to import currencies other than USD above certain limits, without a permit from the CBTL.

USD banknotes issued before 2000 are not accepted.

If you import more than $US2,000 worth of Australian dollars in a calendar month, you will need approval.

Contact the Central Bank of Timor-Leste for details:

* email: [info@bancocentral](mailto:info@bancocentral)
* call CBTL +67 0 331 3712 or +67 0 331 3714

Most places won't take credit cards, including hotels, shops and restaurants. Bring enough USD in cash to meet your needs.

Ask your bank if your Australian credit or debit cards work in Timor-Leste. Only visa cards are accepted in Timor-Leste; you cannot use other credit cards.

You might not be able to change Australian dollars for USD.

#### Local travel

#### West Timor

If you're travelling to West Timor or other parts of Indonesia, read our [travel advice for Indonesia](/destinations/asia/indonesia "Indonesia").

#### Religious and cultural sites

You need permission to visit some places that have special religious or cultural importance.

Check with local authorities before you visit.

Check local reactions to your presence and activities and adjust accordingly.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Timor-Leste, you need both:

* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)
* your current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

Driving without an IDP could invalidate your travel and vehicle insurance.

After three months, you'll need to get a local licence.

#### Road travel

Driving conditions are dangerous because of:

* bad roads
* heavy traffic
* poor signage
* a lack of street lighting

In rural areas, dangers include:

* sinking ground
* large potholes
* pedestrians and animals on the road
* vehicles without headlights

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Timor-Leste than in Australia.

Large crowds can form quickly after traffic accidents. The situation can become violent with little warning.

Main routes are often single-lane mountain roads. They can worsen quickly and become blocked. This can happen more readily in the rainy season from November to April.

Outside Dili, Australian officials travelling for work don't drive at night other than in exceptional situations.

Outside Dili, there are limited emergency response resources.

Check security and road conditions with local authorities before you travel.

Make sure you have adequate insurance cover before driving in Timor-Leste.

If you drive:

* learn local traffic laws and driving practices
* always carry your car registration papers and driver's licence
* always keep car windows up and doors locked
* travel in convoy in regional areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

If you're in an accident, report it to the local police.

#### Traffic disruptions

Traffic disruptions and blocks on major thoroughfares can happen.

Police can set up checkpoints anywhere. Makeshift barricades are sometimes used as unauthorised roadblocks.

Police may close roads in Dili during large events, such as commemorative ceremonies or [major sporting events](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event").

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Many taxis are in poor condition. Driving standards are often poor. If you choose to use taxis, seek local advice on recommended companies.

You're at risk of [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), sexual harassment and [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") in a taxi.

It's safer to arrange limousines or hire cars through your hotel.

Avoid using taxis, especially if you're a woman.

#### Public transport

Many buses, 'microlets' and trucks used as [public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport) are not well maintained.

Poor driving standards add to the risk.

#### Sea travel

Travel by boat can be dangerous.

Not all vessels are seaworthy.

Passenger limits are sometimes exceeded. Don't get on or stay on an overloaded vessel.

Before booking sea travel, confirm that vessel maintenance and safety standards are maintained.

There may not be enough life jackets on board. Make sure any vessel you board is carrying safety equipment, including enough life jackets for all crew, passengers and children.

Some cruise lines have stopped over in Timor-Leste.

#### Piracy

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) happens in South-East Asian waters.

The [International Maritime Bureau](http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) publishes piracy reports.

Avoid trouble spots and take safety precautions.

#### Air travel

Airport infrastructure across the country may be maintained to a different standard than in Australia, including emergency response vehicles.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Timor-Leste's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CR-T) with the Aviation Safety Network.
