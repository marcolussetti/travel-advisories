#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm your insurance covers:

* your activities and care
* you for the whole time you'll be away
* medical evacuation including flight, transfers and hospital costs.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check with the Timor-Leste Embassy or Consulate if it's legal in Timor-Leste. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mosquito-borne diseases

While cases of malaria are not common, other mosquito-borne diseases can be found in Timor-Leste.

Dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste and outbreaks can occur in the monsoon season (generally December to April). Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* review our advice on [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases").

If you're travelling to rural areas, discuss malaria-prevention medication with your doctor before you travel.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is fatal if left untreated. It's a viral disease found in dogs, monkeys, bats and other mammals.

Rabies has been detected in Timor-Leste and in neighbouring West Timor (Indonesia). Suspected cases have been treated in Dili, but some require offshore treatment. Rabies is fatal without immediate treatment.

To stay safe:

* avoid dogs, cats, monkeys and other mammals
* if you're bitten or scratched, seek treatment straight away and be prepared to return to Australia promptly for treatment which may not be available locally

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [gastroenteritis](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* don't eat ice cubes
* don't eat raw or undercooked food, such as salads

[Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis) is widespread. Healthcare workers are especially at risk of being exposed to the disease.

If you're a healthcare worker, get tested for tuberculosis before you travel and after you leave.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Fish poisoning

Local authorities have advised that fish sold on the roadside can be contaminated with formaldehyde.

Follow local warnings and advice.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited. Stamford Medical Clinic is Dili's main healthcare facility.

Most emergency cases are treated at Dili National Hospital, which has limited facilities.

Dental facilities are limited.

A limited supply of basic medications is available.

There is no hyperbaric chamber in Timor-Leste. If you're going to dive, make sure you have a current medical clearance and you're covered by insurance.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
