## Overview

### Safety

* Local unrest does occur, including street gang fighting and political demonstrations, and minor disputes can become violent. Large public gatherings should be avoided, particularly around Tasi Tolu and Comoro in Dili. Violent and petty crime is not common in Dili, however, the risk increases at night and if travelling alone.
* Criminals sometimes target foreigners. Home invasions, while not frequent, do occur. Lock your accommodation, even when you're inside. Drive with doors locked and windows up.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave drinks unattended. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Travellers can experience sexual harassment, including lewd remarks and indecent exposure. Although offenders mostly target women, they may harass men. Sexual assault can happen in public places, such as Beach Road in Dili. Travel as a group if you can, including when exercising outdoors. Don't use public transport or taxis alone, especially at night.
* Crocodile attacks are reported in the eastern districts and along the southern coast. Crocodiles have been seen on beaches and inland waterways, including in Dili. Follow local advice.
* Severe storms occur during the wet season, from November to April. Flooding and landslides can damage roads and disrupt services. Follow the advice of local officials.
* Timor-Leste is in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes do occur and there is a risk of tsunamis. Familiarise yourself with earthquake security measures in hotels and public and private buildings. In the event of an earthquake, pay careful attention to local authority guidance.

### Health

* Rabies has been detected in Timor-Leste and neighbouring West Timor (Indonesia). Rabies is fatal without post-exposure treatment, recommended within 24 hours of exposure. Avoid dogs, cats, monkeys, bats and other mammals. In the event of an animal bite or scratch, seek urgent medical advice. Rabies post-exposure treatment includes vaccinations and, if necessary, immunoglobulin treatment. This could require transportation to Australia as access to post-exposure rabies vaccination in Timor-Leste is limited.
* While malaria cases are uncommon, other mosquito-borne diseases can be found in Timor-Leste. Dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste, peaking in the monsoon season (generally from December to April). Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are widespread. These include gastroenteritis, typhoid and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Tuberculosis is widespread. Healthcare workers are at risk. If you're a healthcare worker, get tested for tuberculosis before you travel and after you leave.
* Fish sold on the roadside may be contaminated with formaldehyde. Follow local warnings and advice.
* Medical facilities are limited, including at Dili National Hospital, which treats most emergency cases. Dental facilities are limited. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. There are serious penalties for drug offences.
* Don't interfere in local political processes or take part in political activity. If you do, you may face fines, detention or deportation.
* Timor-Leste doesn't recognise de facto or same-sex relationships. Social and cultural attitudes towards same-sex relationships are conservative. Avoid public displays of affection.
* Dress and behaviour standards are conservative. Don't wear revealing clothing in public places, churches or markets. Public displays of affection aren't socially acceptable. Loud noise and foolish behaviour on religious days are offensive.

### Travel

* You can get a 30-day visa on arrival if you visit as a tourist and arrive via President Nicolau Lobato International Airport or Dili Seaport. If you enter at another location or by land, you'll need to get a visa before arrival. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest Timor-Leste Embassy or Consulate for current advice.
* Many taxis are in poor condition. You're at risk of robbery, sexual harassment, and sexual assault in taxis. Avoid using taxis, especially if you're female. If you choose to use taxis, seek local advice on recommended companies.
* Airport infrastructure across the country may be maintained to a different standard than in Australia, including emergency response vehicles.
