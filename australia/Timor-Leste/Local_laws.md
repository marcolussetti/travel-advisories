# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

There are serious penalties for drug offences.

#### Other laws

Don't interfere in local political processes or take part in political activity. If you do, you'll face fines, detention, or deportation.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Timor-Leste doesn't recognise de facto or same-sex relationships.

Social and cultural attitudes towards same-sex relationships are conservative.

Avoid public displays of affection. They aren't socially acceptable.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationals

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).
