# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Although stable for some years, there are still ongoing security risks. The situation could change with little warning.

People have protested against the Australian Government outside the Australian Embassy. They could protest again.

Australians have been harassed because of their nationality.

Localised unrest happens in Timor-Leste, including street gang fighting and political demonstrations.

Minor disputes can escalate into violence without warning.

To stay safe:

* always pay close attention to your personal security
* avoid unplanned gatherings, demonstrations, protests, street rallies and large public gatherings as they may turn violent
* monitor the media for news about safety and security risks
* avoid identified trouble spots

Move to a safe place if:

* you're being harassed
* gatherings turn violent

In Dili, be careful around Tasi Tolu, Comoro and other crowded areas.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

There is a history of gang-related violence, robbery, arson and vandalism in major towns, especially Dili.  
  
Martial Arts Groups (MAGs) and Ritual Arts Groups (RAGs) are mass membership organisations with a complex history in Timorese society and political culture. On 10 November 2023, the Timorese government announced a six-month ban on all MAG and RAG activities.   
  
Rival groups are frequently involved in violence against each other, which increases the potential for local disputes between individuals or families to escalate into communal violence.

#### Crime

Criminals sometimes target foreigners for petty crimes such as theft. Although uncommon, there have been attacks in Dili, nearby beaches, and rural areas. Home and room invasions occur. Lock your accommodation, including when you're inside.

Crime risks increase at night, and if you're travelling alone.

Smash-and-grab property theft from vehicles happens.

Intruders have broken into homes where foreigners are known to be.

Gang-related violence, robbery, arson and vandalism occur in major towns, including Dili.

Rocks are sometimes thrown at vehicles and property. This mostly happens during the early evening and at night.

To stay safe:

* be alert to your surroundings
* don't carry bags that are easy to snatch
* keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* don't leave valuables exposed in your car
* secure your accommodation, even when you're home

#### Sexual harassment and assault

Sexual harassment of foreigners is common. This usually affects women. However, men can also be targeted.

Harassment can include:

* lewd remarks
* indecent exposure
* indecent touching and groping

Violence against local women is widespread.

Sexual assault can happen at any time.

People have reported assaults in areas in Dili such as:

* Beach Road
* Christo Rei, the Jesus Statue
* Tasi Tolu
* around Back Beach, behind the Cristo Rei (Jesus) Statue

To stay safe:

* travel as a group if you can, including when exercising outdoors
* don't visit isolated areas alone
* don't travel alone on public transport or in taxis, especially at night

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Alcohol production is less regulated in some destinations than in Australia. This can lead to methanol being used in the production process to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Locals and foreigners, including Australians, have died or become seriously ill from poisoned drinks overseas.

Contaminated drinks could include:

* local home-brewed spirits
* spirit-based drinks, such as cocktails
* brand name alcohol

To protect yourself from drink poisoning:

* consider the risks when drinking alcoholic beverages
* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks

Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Timor-Leste experiences [cyclones](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"), [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), bushfires and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

Tropical cyclones are rare. Severe storms usually happen during the wet season, from November to April.

Heavy rain can cause [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), landslides and damage to roads. It can also affect services.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or severe weather happens:

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family

Stay up to date on weather conditions and forecasts, natural disaster watches and warnings. Plan accordingly.

To check local and regional weather and disaster sites, visit:

* [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* [World Meteorological Organisation Severe Weather Information Centre](http://severe.worldweather.org/)

If you're travelling during the wet season or after a natural disaster, ask your tour operator if services are affected.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

[Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") happen.

For real-time information on earthquakes, see the [US Geological Service](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map).

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the [US Tsunami Warning Center](https://www.tsunami.gov/).

Follow the advice of your accommodation provider and local authorities.

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away if advised, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.

Crocodiles have been sighted on beaches and inland waterways at:
