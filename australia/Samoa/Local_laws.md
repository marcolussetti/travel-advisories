You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for carrying or using illegal drugs, including cannabis, may include a jail sentence.

By law, you must not own drug-related equipment in Samoa.

If police suspect a drug offence, they may detain you while they investigate.
