#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care or evacuation. Most health care providers in Samoa expect cash payment before carrying out any treatment, and options for treatment in-country are very limited.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may be considered illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Samoa. Carry with you enough legal medication for your trip.

Local pharmacies have a limited range of medication.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Be careful if you're consuming kava. It can be dangerous if it reacts with alcohol or prescription medication, including antidepressants.

Mosquito-borne diseases are prevalent in Samoa.

Samoa’s Ministry of Health has declared a dengue outbreak. Healthcare systems are facing pressures with the increasing number of cases.Protect yourself against mosquito bites and use insect repellent. See [Healthdirect Australia](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthdirect.gov.au%2Fdengue-fever&data=05%7C02%7CGeri.Furness%40dfat.gov.au%7C0b0a969f987242a4065a08dd86b5a56b%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638814836909497126%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Gw92Yr4m62K5BUrWNNXUgyA%2FxcvzJvT05HpD0g3GaIk%3D&reserved=0) for more information. 

Outbreaks of insect-borne diseases can happen, mostly in the wet season. Diseases include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [zika virus](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-factsheet-basics.htm)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/health-topics/chikungunya/#tab=tab_1)

To protect yourself from disease:

* take preventative measures, such as minimising skin exposure by wearing long, loose, light-coloured clothing and using insect repellent
* consult your travel doctor for information on available vaccines and their suitability for your individual circumstances
* seek medical attention at the nearest health facility if you're experiencing symptoms such as acute onset fever, nausea, aches and pains and rashes
* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider putting off travel to Zika virus-affected areas

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Hospital and medical facilities are very limited.

All foreigners are required to pay for health services in Samoa. Doctors and hospitals normally expect cash payment before carrying out any treatment.

There's no helicopter service.

Blood supplies are often limited.

You may need to bring your own bedding and towels to hospital.

If you experience a medical emergency or become seriously ill or injured, evacuation by air to Australia or New Zealand is likely to be the only option for treatment. Medical evacuation can be very expensive, and evacuations may be delayed if you use commercial airlines. Flights are heavily booked in New Zealand and Australian school holiday periods.

Make sure your travel insurance covers medical evacuations.

#### Hyperbaric chambers

There are no hyperbaric chambers on any of the islands. If you need treatment for decompression sickness, you'll be evacuated to the nearest treatment centre.

Registered dive companies carry basic treatment equipment to meet Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) standards.
