# Safety

#### Crime

Crime occurs in Samoa but the crime rate is not high.

Crimes you could experience include [robbery,](/node/344) violent [assault](/node/354) and [sexual assault](/node/355).

You're most at risk:

* in downtown Apia bars
* near the sea wall area along the harbour front, especially at night

Petty crime is common, including theft from vehicles and accommodation.

Violent house break-ins can occur.

To protect yourself from crime:

* avoid going out alone at night
* avoid isolated locations, including beaches
* be aware of your surroundings, especially in the downtown Apia and harbour-front areas
* keep your windows, doors, gates and vehicle locked

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government’s longstanding policy is that it doesn’t make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare and protests are generally peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and crowds
* monitor the media for possible unrest

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Swimming safety

#### Beaches

Beaches are not patrolled in Samoa. Swimmers have died because of strong tides and powerful lagoon currents.

Risks are even higher when:

* the tide is going out
* the sea is rough

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* regularly check weather reports
* take warnings seriously
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment and weather conditions before continuing with planned activities
* if possible, take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities

Ask local residents and tour operators about safe areas for swimming.

#### Street dogs

Stray and poorly controlled dogs are common. Dog attacks on people in suburban areas and on beaches are common.

Don't approach or touch dogs. Be mindful of dogs if walking or exercising.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Dive companies and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes:

* adventure tours
* fishing charters
* offshore surfing charters

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/node/356):

* Ensure you have travel insurance and that it covers for the activities you plan
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Samoa experiences [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* [cyclones](/node/346)
* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* [tsunamis](/node/346)

Monitor weather updates and warnings via:

* [Samoa Meteorology Division](http://www.samet.gov.ws/)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)

If a natural disaster happens:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local media
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with your friends and family

If your arrival in Samoa is after a natural disaster or during cyclone season, ask your tour operator if services have been affected.

#### Cyclones and severe weather

Cyclone season is from November to April. However, tropical storms and cyclones can happen any time of year.

Storms and cyclones can cause flooding and gale-force winds and disrupt services.

The direction and strength of tropical cyclones can change with little warning.

If there's a cyclone or severe tropical storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* ports may close
* adequate shelter may not be available

Roads can be cut off. It may take time for services, such as electricity, to be restored.

Monitor:

* [Joint Typhoon Warning Centre](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)
* [Samoa Meteorology Division](http://www.samet.gov.ws/)

If a cyclone or severe storm is approaching:

* know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plan
* identify your local shelter
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes

Earthquakes and aftershocks happen often in Samoa.

Ask your host or hotel about what to do if there's an earthquake.

If there's an earthquake:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* consider tsunami risks
* monitor the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/)

After an earthquake:

* expect aftershocks
* prepare for travel delays and to change your plans
* ask your travel agent and tour operators to confirm travel services and accommodation bookings

#### Tsunamis

Samoa has a Tsunami Warning System as Tsunamis can happen.

Move immediately to high ground if you:

* are advised to by local authorities or hear the Tsunami Warning System alarm
* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings.

Once on high ground, monitor local media.
