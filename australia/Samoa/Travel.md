#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You can apply for a 90 day Visitor Permit on arrival using the passenger arrival card if you:

* stay less than 90 days
* visit for tourism
* have confirmed return or onward ticket
* have enough funds to support yourself
* have a passport that's valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay

If you remain in Samoa and are unable to depart prior to the expiry of your permit you must contact [Samoa Immigration](https://mpmc.gov.ws/divisions/immigration/) to make arrangements to validate your residential status until you can depart.

For other situations and for Business Visitor Permits, see the [Ministry of Prime Minister and Cabinet website](https://mpmc.gov.ws/).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your airline or your nearest [High Commission/Embassy or Consulate of Samoa](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/171/State)for details about the latest visa and entry requirements. 

Renew your Australian passport well in advance of expiry due to potential delays in delivery to Samoa.

#### Border measures

For information on entry requirements, check the [Government of Samoa](https://www.samoagovt.ws/) website.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Samoan Tala (WST).

Declare amounts over WST 20,000 when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can change money and find ATMs at the airport on arrival and in the major centres.

Credit cards can be used at most resorts and large shops. Not many small businesses accept credit cards.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You need a temporary Samoan driver's licence to drive.

Get a temporary licence from:

* Samoa Tourism Fale
* Land and Transport Authority
* some car hire agencies

You'll need to show your valid Australian licence and pay a fee.

#### Road travel

Driving in Samoa is hazardous, especially at night.

Hazards include:

* poorly lit and maintained roads
* lack of footpaths and verges
* animals and pedestrians on roads
* drivers not following traffic laws

Samoa switched to driving on the left-hand side of the road in 2009. However, many vehicles still have the driver's seat on the left.

If you plan to drive:

* check if you're covered by your travel and hire car insurance policies
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* avoid driving at night

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and car escort services.

Book through your hotel or resort.

#### Public transport

Samoa has a small and irregular bus network. Buses are usually crowded and poorly maintained. Accidents involving buses are common. Travelling on buses should be given careful consideration.

Bus schedules are limited on Sundays.

Petty crime can happen on buses. Take care of your belongings.

#### Sea travel

Samoa's inter-island ferries may not meet Australian safety standards. They may:

* be old
* be overcrowded
* not have enough life jackets and life rafts for everyone

Emergency safety procedures may not work.

If you need to travel by ferry:

* before booking, check the operator's safety history and their safety equipment
* don't travel on an overcrowded or overloaded vessel
* always use the safety equipment, such as life jackets, even if others don't

If you aren't given safety equipment, or it's not in usable condition, use another provider.
