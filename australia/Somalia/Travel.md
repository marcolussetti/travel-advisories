#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit requirements can change. Contact an [Embassy or Consulate-General of Somalia](https://web.mfa.gov.so/find-our-embassy-abroad/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Consulates and other diplomatic missions of Somalia have connections with the central government. However, the central government's authority isn't recognised everywhere.

Visas might not be valid in areas where the central government's authority is challenged, particularly in Somaliland and Puntland. If you're visiting these areas, direct your visa enquiries to the person or organisation you will be visiting.

**Border measures**

International and domestic flights are operating. Flights and airport access may change without warning.

Passengers must arrive at the border checkpoint at least 3 hours before departure for health and safety procedures.

Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. Check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for [Ethiopia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/Ethiopia), [Kenya](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/kenya) or [Djibouti](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/djibouti).

Don't cross the border without the correct documents, as officials may stop you. You may get a fine or detention if you cross borders illegally. The land border with Kenya is currently closed due to recent cross border terrorist activity. There have been reports that foreign nationals have been prevented from crossing the Djiboutian border into Somalia, though the border remains open.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever) vaccination certificate to enter Somalia. You may need to show proof of vaccination if you're coming from a country where yellow fever occurs.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

The government regulates currency transfer and exchange.

Australian currency, credit cards and traveller's cheques aren't accepted.

ATMs aren't usually available.

#### Local travel

**Landmines**

Landmines and unexploded ordnance are a danger throughout Somalia.

Road travel in Somalia is dangerous.

**Air travel**

Aden Adde International Airport is a high-priority target for attack due to the presence of foreigners. Due to security threats, it's often closed with little or no warning.

Other airports and aircraft are also possible targets for terror attacks.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Somalia's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=6O) with the Aviation Safety Network.
