#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Somalia.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Somalia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

**Insect-borne diseases**

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs throughout the year in all parts of Somalia. Current treatments aren't effective against some strains.

Other insect-borne diseases also occur. These include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing.

Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel.

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

**Polio**

Outbreaks of [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) have occurred in Somalia.

Check your polio vaccination status with your doctor or travel clinic at least 8 weeks before you travel. You may need a booster dose.

If you aren't vaccinated, complete the full course of vaccinations before you leave.

If you're staying in Somalia for longer than 4 weeks, you'll need to show proof when you exit that you've had the polio vaccine or a booster within the past 12 months. If you don't, you may need to be vaccinated before leaving Somalia.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in Somalia are extremely limited.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. It can also be difficult to organise.
