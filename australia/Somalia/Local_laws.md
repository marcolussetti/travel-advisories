# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Consular help

Somalia hasn't signed the Vienna Conventions on diplomatic and consular relations.

If you're arrested or detained, you may not be able to contact the Australian Government or access consular services.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They may include prison and heavy fines.

#### Other laws

Courts operate under both Somali and Sharia law.

Strict sharia law is in force in areas under al-Shabaab control. Sentences include physical punishments such as flogging and the death penalty.

Get professional advice on local legal matters, particularly about:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support
* sexual assault and rape

Be aware of your rights and responsibilities.

Criminal laws are inconsistently enforced in Somalia. Due process isn't always followed.

Same-sex relations are illegal in Somalia. Punishments under strict Sharia law include flogging or death.

It's also illegal to preach a religion other than Islam in Puntland or Somaliland.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

#### Cultural sensitivities

Somalia has strict conservative standards of dress and behaviour. If in doubt, ask for local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Somalia. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
