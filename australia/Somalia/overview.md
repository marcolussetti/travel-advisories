## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel to Somalia. If you're in the country, leave as soon as possible. If you decide to stay, get professional security advice. Our ability to provide consular services is severely limited.
* Terrorist attacks occur in Somalia. Targets may include Aden Adde International Airport, government officials and buildings, hotels, restaurants, foreigners and foreign interests, and UN workers. Recent incidents have caused hundreds of fatalities and injuries. The UK and US Embassies in Somalia issue frequent security alerts about potential imminent terrorist attacks in Somalia.
* The kidnapping risk is very high in all parts of Somalia. This includes Puntland and Somaliland. Several active terrorist groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners. Make sure your movements aren't predictable. Avoid conflict areas.
* [Pirate attacks](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) in and around Somalia's waters, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden are a serious threat. This includes far off the Somali coast.
* Residential areas and markets in south-central Somalia have experienced shootings and grenade attacks. Avoid large public gatherings.
* The Australian High Commission in Kenya has received reports that some schools and institutions in Somalia act as 'cultural rehabilitation’ centres without oversight. Minors and young adults may be abused or held against their will in these facilities. We are limited in the assistance we can provide. Communication with the centres or people in them may not be possible or may take a long time to establish.
* Somalia has extreme weather, including severe droughts, heatwaves and floods. Tsunamis may occur. During a natural disaster, monitor local and international media. Follow local advice.

### Health

* Malaria occurs across the country. Consider taking anti-malaria medication. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue, yellow fever, filariasis and leishmaniasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel.
* Somalia continues to have cases of polio. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel. Carry proof of vaccination.
* There are cases of HIV/AIDS in Somalia. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities. If you're a victim of violent crime, including rape, get medical help as soon as possible.
* There are foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases in Somalia. This includes cholera, hepatitis and meningococcal disease. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities in Somalia are extremely limited. If you're ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation out of the country. This is expensive and difficult to organise.

### Local laws

* Courts operate under both Somali and Sharia law. In areas under al-Shabaab control, sentences include flogging and the death penalty. Get local legal advice, especially on matters such as sexual assault, divorce, child custody and child support.
* Domestic and sexual violence against women remains a serious issue. There are no laws against spousal violence, including rape. If you experience sexual assault, consider contacting the Consular Emergency Centre or the Australian High Commission in Nairobi to discuss your circumstances.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include prison sentences and heavy fines.
* Same-sex relations are illegal in Somalia. Under sharia law, punishments include flogging and death.
* It's illegal to preach a religion other than Islam in parts of Somalia.
* Some Australian laws apply overseas. It's illegal to support military activities in Somalia without permission from the Australian Government.
* Local authorities treat Australian-Somali dual nationals as Somali. Consular help is limited.
