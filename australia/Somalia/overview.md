## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel to Somalia. If you're in the country, leave as soon as possible. If you decide to stay, get professional security advice. Our ability to provide consular services is severely limited.
* Terrorist attacks occur in Somalia. Targets may include Aden Adde International Airport, government officials and buildings, hotels, restaurants, foreigners and foreign interests, and UN workers. Recent incidents have caused hundreds of fatalities and injuries. The US Embassy in Somalia has issued an [alert](https://so.usembassy.gov/security-alert-for-u-s-citizens-march-4-2025/) about potential imminent attacks against multiple locations, including Aden Adde International Airport.
* The kidnapping risk is very high in all parts of Somalia. This includes Puntland and Somaliland. Several active terrorist groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners. Make sure your movements aren't predictable. Avoid conflict areas.
* [Pirate attacks](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) in and around Somalia's waters, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden are a serious threat. This includes far off the Somali coast.
* Residential areas and markets in south-central Somalia have experienced shootings and grenade attacks. Avoid large public gatherings.
* The Australian High Commission in Kenya has received reports that some schools and institutions acting as 'cultural rehabilitation’ centres operate in Somalia without oversight. Minors and young adults may be abused or held against their will in these facilities.
* Somalia has extreme weather, including severe droughts, heatwaves and floods. It's also prone to tsunamis. During a natural disaster, monitor local and international media. Follow local advice.

* Somalia continues to have cases of polio. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel. Carry proof of vaccination.
* There are cases of HIV/AIDS in Somalia. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities. If you're a victim of violent crime, including rape, get medical help as soon as possible.
* There are foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases in Somalia. This includes cholera, hepatitis and meningococcal disease. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
