#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks occur frequently in Somalia, and can take place anywhere, at any time. Targets include Somali government officials, foreigners and UN workers. Recent attacks have occurred in Mogadishu, Beledweyne, Baidoa, Galkayo and Kismayo and have resulted in hundreds of fatalities and injuries.

Somali militants have threatened attacks throughout the country.

Aden Adde International Airport is a high-priority target because of the large number of foreigners present.

**Common targets**

Deadly attacks against government targets, including buildings, are common.

Foreigners and Somalis working for international organisations and the African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) are also targeted.

Attacks could involve explosions, car bombs and armed gunmen.

Other targets for attacks include:

* hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars and other commercial and public areas visited by government officials and foreigners
* foreign interests, including embassies, oil companies, oil infrastructure and oil fields
* places of worship, schools, markets, shopping areas, tourist areas, historic sites, outdoor recreation events and other public spaces
* transport and transport infrastructure, including airports and aircraft
* residential areas

There have been more attacks during days of national significance and religious festivals, including Ramadan.

Somalia isn't safe. It doesn't have an effective police force.

Do not travel to Somalia. If you're already there, leave Somalia as soon as possible.

If, despite our advice, you decide to stay, you should:

* get professional security advice
* arrange personal security measures
* plan for uncertainty and stock up on essential items (water, food, toiletries, fuel and prescription medication)
* limit your movements, especially around days of national significance and religious festivals
* be alert at all times
* have a clear exit plan.

If there's an attack, you should:

* leave the area straight away if it's safe to do so
* avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks
* monitor the media for any new or emerging threats.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped while travelling overseas. Kidnapping can occur anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically considered at lower risk. The [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") risk is very high in all parts of Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland.

Several active terrorist groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners. Many foreigners, including those of Somali descent, have been kidnapped in Somalia.

Kidnappers may be motivated by crime or terrorism. Armed groups in Somalia have held foreigners kidnapped from Kenya.

Do not travel to Somalia. If you're already in Somalia, leave as soon as possible.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, you should be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.  
  
To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* keep a low profile
* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* vary your routines, so your movements don't become predictable to observers
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* always use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The political situation is unpredictable, particularly in Mogadishu. Demonstrations can occur and turn violent without warning.  

#### Armed conflict

Residential areas and markets in south-central Somalia have experienced shootings and grenade attacks.

If you're in Somalia despite our advice:

* avoid areas where conflict is ongoing or political tensions are highest
* avoid all protests, rallies, demonstrations and other public gatherings.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Crime

#### Piracy

[Pirate attacks](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) in and around Somalia's waters, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden are an increasingly frequent and serious threat. This includes far off the Somali coast.

Pirates are heavily armed, have attacked vessels and held foreigners hostage for ransom in the Gulf of Aden.

Attractive targets for pirates include:

* local fishing dhows
* commercial boats
* pleasure crafts
* luxury cruise liners

Don't travel in Somali waters or surrounds, or you face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.

If you need to [travel by boat](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel) in Somali waters or surrounds, you should:

* stay out of the [designated High Risk Area](http://www.mschoa.org/on-shore/home)
* travel in groups or convoys
* always stay in close contact with convoy members
* arrange personal security

#### Cultural 'rehabilitation' facilities and schools

The Australian High Commission in Kenya has received reports that some schools and institutions acting as 'cultural rehabilitation' centres operate in Somalia without oversight. The reports claim that minors and young adults may be abused and held against their will in these facilities.

#### Violent crime

There's no effective police force in Somalia. There's a breakdown in law and order. Lawlessness, clan violence and looting are common.

Anti-Western attitudes are strong in some parts of Somalia. Foreigners are sometimes violently harassed, including people of Somali descent.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Other factors

Extreme weather conditions in southern and central Somalia have added to the unstable security environment. Areas bordering Ethiopia and Kenya are also affected.

Food shortages and population displacements have left thousands of people homeless and vulnerable. This has led to more disease and more crime.

If you're in Somalia despite our advice, you should:

* always travel with your vehicle's doors locked and windows up
* lock the doors and windows of your accommodation
* be alert at all times.

There are cases of HIV/AIDS in Somalia. If you're a victim of violent crime, including rape, see a doctor as soon as possible.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Somalia experiences [natural disasters](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident), including [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#tsunamis) and [floods](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#floods).

If, despite our advice, you travel to or stay in Somalia and a natural disaster occurs:

* store your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local media and the [World Meteorological Organization Severe Weather Information Centre](http://severe.worldweather.org/)
* check other sources, such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* keep in touch with friends and family.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised to by local authorities, or if you:

* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea.

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, check local media.

#### Severe weather

Somalia's weather can be extreme. There are regular droughts and floods.

Because of severe weather, many areas of Somalia suffer from food shortages. Thousands of people are left without a place to live, leading to more disease and higher security threats to foreigners.

Somalia is often very hot. The average maximum temperature can be more than 45˚C.

Stay out of the sun and drink water to avoid dehydration.

The monsoon season runs from May to October in the south-west. It's from December to February in the north-east.
