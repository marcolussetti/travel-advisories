#### Emergencies

Depending on what you need, contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

The security situation in Somalia limits the ability of the Australian Government to provide consular help.

Australia doesn't have a diplomatic mission in Somalia. Contact the Australian High Commission in Kenya for consular help.

You may consider registering for updates from other missions in Somalia.
