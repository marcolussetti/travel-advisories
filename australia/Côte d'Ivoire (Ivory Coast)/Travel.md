#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/ConsulatesInAustralia) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Measures are frequently reviewed and may change at short notice. Check with your nearest [Côte d’Ivoire Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) for details.

#### Staying in Côte d'Ivoire

If you're visiting Côte d'Ivoire, you may experience travel bans, curfews and other restrictions on your movement. 

* Follow the advice of local authorities
* Ensure you have arrangements in place for an extended stay
* Keep in contact with family and friends so they know you're safe and well

#### Other formalities

#### Art objects

You need an exit permit from the National Museum to take art objects from Côte d'Ivoire.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Côte d'Ivoire. You may be asked to show your certificate when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://smartraveller.govcms.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services/passports-australia#get-a-passport).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency is the West African CFA Franc. Abidjan has many ATMs, but they may not be reliable.

ATMs are rare outside of Abidjan. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough cash for your trip.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

To drive in Côte d’Ivoire, you need:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* registration papers
* Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Brown Card insurance

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

The road system is generally good. Conditions are worse outside of Abidjan. Roads may be impassable in the rainy season.

Dangers include:

* unskilled drivers
* poorly maintained vehicles
* overloaded vehicles
* poor lighting

You're more likely to die in a car accident in Côte d'Ivoire than in Australia.

Armed robbers (coupeurs de route) carry out attacks on highways (see [Safety).](#safety)

To stay safe on the road:

* avoid driving at night
* plan road journeys carefully
* take security precautions

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are common throughout the country, especially at the entrances and exits of major cities. 

 You may be asked to identify yourself. 

* Expect the presence of the gendarmerie
* Don't drive through a roadblock without stopping, even if it seems unguarded
* If you are stopped, follow the gendarmerie's instructions
