#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Côte d'Ivoire. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Côte d'Ivoire.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) (World Health Organization) infection is high. Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in Côte d'Ivoire. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel. You'll be required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival in Côte d’Ivoire. 

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) and other tropical diseases are common.

To protect yourself from diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other diseases are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [dengue fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

If there is an outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water

If you're pregnant, discuss travel plans with your doctor. Consider deferring non-essential travel to Zika-affected areas.

Get medical advice if you develop a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities and emergency services outside of Abidjan are very limited.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
