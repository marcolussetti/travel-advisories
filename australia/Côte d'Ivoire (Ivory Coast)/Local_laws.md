# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for the use of illegal drugs can include jail and heavy fines.

#### Same-sex couples

Same-sex relationships are legal.

However, public displays of affection between members of the same sex can be an 'offence against public decency'. Penalties include fines and jail terms of up to two years. Avoid public displays of affection.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
