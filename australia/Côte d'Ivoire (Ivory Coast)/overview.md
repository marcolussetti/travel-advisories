### Safety

* Avoid any protests and demonstrations. Public protests and events can turn violent. Avoid large gatherings, monitor the local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Terrorist attacks are a risk. Attacks can be random and may occur in places foreigners visit, including shopping areas, entertainment and food venues and sporting events.
* Pay attention to your personal safety. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* The situation is unstable near the borders of Burkina Faso and Mali. There's an ongoing risk of terrorist activity due to the presence of armed groups. There may be clashes between armed groups and security forces.
* Inter-communal land conflicts occur regularly and result in violent clashes near the Liberian border.
* Armed robbery and violent crime are common. Armed bandits have attacked travellers along roads. Pedestrians have also been attacked. Plan road journeys carefully and take safety precautions. Conceal your valuables.
* There’s an increased risk of kidnapping in the northern border areas with Mali and Burkina Faso. If despite our advice you travel to these regions, get professional security advice.

* The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is high. Take precautions if engaging in high-risk activities.
* Yellow fever is widespread in Côte d'Ivoire. Malaria and other tropical diseases are common. Make sure your accommodation is insect proof. Use insect repellent.
* Medical and emergency services are very limited. You may need to pay cash up-front, even in an emergency. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Make sure you have the right insurance and enough money to cover all your costs.
