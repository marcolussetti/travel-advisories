#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. This includes in Côte d'Ivoire.

There’s a heightened risk of terrorism in the north of Côte d'Ivoire across border areas with Mali and Burkina Faso, particularly the regions of Folon, Bagoué, Poro and Tchologo; the provinces of Northern Zanzan and Savenes as well as in the Bounkani region, which includes Comoé National Park, where terrorists and other armed groups and militias are active.

An attack could happen anywhere and at anytime:

* consider likely targets and level of security provided, including places visited by foreigners such as shopping centres and airports
* always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious items or activities to police

To protect yourself from being involved in a terrorist attack:

* monitor the media for possible attacks
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it’s safe to do so
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Domestic political tensions sometimes lead to violent protests and strikes.    
Violence due to civil unrest is a high risk. Public protests and events can turn violent.

Events such as elections and other significant key dates can lead to sporadic violence. Avoid large gatherings in the lead-up to, during and in the aftermath of key dates in your location. You should comply with any additional checks or security measures requested by the authorities, which may be introduced at short notice.

#### Border areas

There's an increased risk of terrorist activity in the regions bordering Mali and Burkina Faso, particularly Folon, Bagoué, Poro and Tchologo; the provinces of Northern Zanzan and Savenes, as well as in the Bounkani region, which includes Comoé National Park, where terrorists and other armed groups and militias are active. Clashes between armed groups and security forces could occur in the area.

Near the Liberian border, local tensions and the presence of armed militias are causing ongoing security issues. This includes in:

* Dix-Huit Montagnes
* Haut-Sassandra
* Moyen-Cavally
* Bas-Sassandra

To avoid violence and protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor the media for updates on civil unrest
* avoid protests and large public gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay alert

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Pay attention to your safety and surroundings, as crimes can occur anytime and anywhere.  
Violent crime occurs regularly, especially at night, in big cities including Abidjan. Incidents include:

* burglary
* assault
* car thefts, especially of luxury cars and four-wheel drive vehicles
* carjacking
* street holdups

Some robbers reportedly wear military uniforms.  
  
Armed robbers (coupeurs de route) are present on secondary and deserted roads. They set up roadblocks to intercept vehicles, including private cars and public transport vehicles. The criminals force vehicles to stop at gunpoint, sometimes assaulting passengers. Incidents occur at all hours of the day and night. They occur mainly in areas of agricultural production (cocoa, coffee, natural rubber and cashew nuts) and gold panning.  
  
Attacks have occurred on:

* the main road from Yamoussoukro to Korogho
* the Abidjan to Yamoussoukro highway

Attacks occur at any time.  
  
Pedestrians have been attacked and robbed while walking:

* across the De Gaulle and Houphouet-Boigny bridges
* to and from the Le Plateau areas

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* plan road journeys carefully and take safety precautions
* always keep car doors locked and windows up
* conceal your valuables

Always be aware of your personal security, particularly in:

* Treichville
* Adjame
* Abobo
* Yopougon

HIV/AIDS is common in Côte d'Ivoire. You're at risk of infection if you're a victim of a violent crime.

Seek urgent medical advice if you're a victim of violent crime, including rape.

#### Scams and internet fraud

Commercial and internet fraud often originates in West African countries. Some victims who then travel to those countries are killed.

Criminals who run these [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") may:

* ask for details of safe bank accounts overseas
* transfer large sums of money, as a donation or for a percentage of the amount involved

As part of this scam, they may also:

* give you fake cashier's cheques for urgent shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* extort money from people after convincing them to travel to Africa for a business opportunity

Fake internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes also operate from some African countries. These scams typically start with a relationship through an internet dating site or chat room.

Your friend or prospective marriage partner will then ask you to send money to help them travel to Australia.

In some cases, the relationship will then end with very little chance of recovering any money.

In other cases, you may be lured to Africa to meet the person. When you arrive, you may be [kidnapped](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping"), [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") or robbed.

If you're a victim of a financial scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Africa to get your money back.

#### Credit card fraud

Credit card fraud is common. Keep your card in sight when paying for something.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australian, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically lower risk. 

There's a threat of kidnapping in Côte d’Ivoire. 

If, despite our advice you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance may be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings, particularly at night
* get professional security advice for travel to locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* avoid predictable movements.  Vary travel routes and times, particularly on your usual routes
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* don't display money or valuables
* use ATMs inside banks, hotels and shopping centres during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services arranged through your hotel
* when travelling by road, keep windows up and doors locked, especially at night

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can cause flooding during the rainy seasons.

Roads may be impassable during these periods.

Rainy seasons are:

* May to August and October to November in southern coastal regions
* July to October and March to May in central and north-central regions
* July to November in the northern region

To protect yourself from severe weather:

* monitor local media sources
* confirm your plans with your tour operator or travel provider
* check conditions with local tour operators and hotels

#### Seasonal wind

The harmattan, a hot wind from the Sahara, blows between December and February.

Be on the lookout for symptoms of dehydration, heatstroke and flu caused by the ever-present dust, all of which can be fatal.

#### Swimming Safety

Swimming is dangerous due to strong coastal currents.
