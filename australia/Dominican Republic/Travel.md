#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Tourist cards

You must buy a tourist card on arrival. It's valid for 30 days. For longer visits, you must pay an extra fee at the airport on departure.

Rules affecting travellers can change at short notice.

#### Border measures

To enter, you must complete the electronic [entry and exit form](https://eticket.migracion.gob.do/). Information on your health and planned stay will be shared with local authorities.

On 5 March 2024, the Dominican Republic Government closed all its borders with Haiti. The borders with Haiti remain closed to travellers.

The Australian Embassy in Mexico cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic from Haiti.  

We advise you do not travel to Haiti ([see Haiti Travel Advice](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/haiti)). Monitor the media and local authorities for information about safety or security risks if travelling near the border.

#### Travel via the United States or Canada

If you're [travelling through the US](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/united-states-america), ensure you meet all current US entry or transit requirements, including if you're transiting through Hawaii. 

If you're [travelling through Canada](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/canada), ensure you meet all entry and transit requirements.

#### Departure tax

There is a departure tax. It might be included in the price of your airline ticket. Confirm with your travel agent or airline.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, contact the local police and make a report, and tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Dominican Peso (DOP).

You can't exchange Australian dollars in the Dominican Republic. However, you can exchange US dollars at banks or official exchange offices.

Take US dollars with you.

#### Local travel

#### Tour operators

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

For trips of less than 3 months, you can drive with:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in the Dominican Republic than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* aggressive driving
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* drivers not following traffic laws
* few signs and poor lighting on rural roads
* sharing roads with pedestrians, bicycles and farm animals

Heavy rains cause mudslides and collapse roads. Roads may be closed at short notice, especially during the hurricane and wet seasons.

If you plan to travel by road:

* check your travel insurance covers it
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* lock doors and keep car windows up, even when moving
* avoid travel at night

If you’re involved in an accident, wait at the scene until police arrive and authorise you to leave.

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance may not cover you for accidents on a motorbike or quad bike. Check your insurance covers it.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Travellers have been robbed and assaulted when using unofficial taxis.

Don’t use route taxis, also known as ‘carros publicos’. They pose a higher risk of passengers being robbed. 

Use airport taxis or pre-book with a reputable company.

Airport taxi drivers wear clearly identifiable photo ID badges.

Taxi drivers often don't provide change, so be prepared to pay with small notes.

To safely use taxis:

* arrange your airport pickup with your hotel before you arrive
* note your taxi driver's name and licence number
* agree on the fare before you set off
* never share a taxi with a stranger
* don't let your driver pick up other passengers

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check the [Dominican Republic's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=HI) with the Aviation Safety Network.
