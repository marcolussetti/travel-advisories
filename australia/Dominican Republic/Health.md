#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan or need to take medication check if it's legal in the Dominican Republic. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Keep medication in their original packaging with a clear label.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

If needed, get DFAT to [authenticate medical documents](/node/361) before you depart.

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Illnesses spread by insects are common, especially during the hot months from May to November.

Disease risks include:

* [dengue](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm)

Zika virus is widespread. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is less common but has been reported in the western area bordering Haiti, at some beach resorts and adventure sports areas.

To protect yourself against disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medication to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

There's a high risk of [rabies](http://www.who.int/rabies/en/) in the Dominican Republic. Avoid direct contact with all animals, especially:

* dogs
* cats

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is high. Take precautions if you take part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

[Cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) is present. It causes diarrhoea and vomiting. It can be fatal if left untreated.

Maintain good food hygiene to minimise your risk of getting cholera.

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis#tab=tab_1)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [leptospirosis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/leptospirosis)

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in major cities are reasonable. In other areas, the standard of facilities is lower, with little English spoken. Blood supplies are often limited. Doctors may only speak Spanish.

Medical care can be expensive. Before receiving treatment, you may be asked to either:

* show proof of medical insurance
* pay upfront
* provide a guarantee of payment

If you are seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.
