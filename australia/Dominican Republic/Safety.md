# Safety

#### Crime

Crime rates are high in the Dominican Republic.

#### Petty Crime

Pickpockets and bag-snatchers are common in major cities. Travellers are often the target in busy areas such as airports and bus terminals.

Travellers have also reported thefts at resorts, on beaches, in hotel rooms, hotel room safes, as well as from cars, particularly rentals.

Thieves on motorbikes, scooters or bicycles often rob pedestrians of their bags and other valuables. They may even reach into vehicles, including taxis, stopped at red lights to steal personal belongings.

Credit card and ATM fraud are common, particularly in Santo Domingo and resort areas.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* don't wear expensive watches or jewellery
* be wary of strangers who offer services without being asked or make unusual requests
* keep car doors locked, windows up and your belongings out of sight
* be alert after dark
* avoid being on the streets alone
* pay attention in crowded areas
* use ATM’s in daylight hours
* withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks, or shopping centres
* avoid withdrawing or carrying large amounts of money

#### Violent crime

Violent crime happens in tourist areas. Victims have been injured when resisting.

Women are particularly at risk of aggressive sexual behaviour and [sexual assault](/node/355).

Be careful at bars and entertainment venues. People have reported being robbed and [assaulted](/node/55) after their drinks were spiked.

To reduce your risk of violent crime:

* don't use public transport
* avoid walking or jogging alone, especially after dark
* travel with others wherever possible, especially if you're a woman
* don't leave your food or drink unattended
* never accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new acquaintances

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially sexual assault, seek immediate medical help. The risk of HIV/AIDS infection is high.

#### Dominican Republic – Haiti border

Roadblocks set up by the military and police are common in the border area. The roadblocks may appear to be unofficial. However, the soldiers wear army uniforms and carry weapons.

There have been armed robberies on roads near the border with Haiti. Some of these have been committed by criminals posing as police officers.

#### Road-based crime

Travellers have been robbed in taxis and private cars to and from Las Americas International Airport. Armed robbers force the vehicle to stop on the side of the road.

To stay safe on the roads:

* use ride share services where possible instead of taxis
* use official taxis and don't hail taxis from the street
* travel to and from the airport during daylight
* don't accept rides from strangers or people you've just met, including hotel employees
* use a tour company with a good reputation, especially if you're travelling to remote areas

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
