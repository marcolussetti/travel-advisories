# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. This includes long prison sentences in local jails.

Authorities may arrest you for illegal drugs if you're either:

* carrying even a very small amount of drugs, or
* with someone who's using them

If you're found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, authorities will arrest and possibly detain you.

Border officials may screen you for drugs, including on departure.
