## Overview

### Safety

* Road accidents are a major cause of injury. Be alert at all times on the roads.
* Petty theft, including bag slashing, is common in tourist areas and crowded places, especially during holidays. Snatch-and-grab theft by thieves on motorcycles is also common. To make bags and backpacks more difficult to steal, hold them in front of you or on the opposite side of the traffic. Be aware of motorbikes approaching as you walk. Carry the minimum amount of valuables. Be prepared to surrender your valuables rather than risk being injured in a struggle.
* Aggravated theft, sexual assault and assault happen. Travellers have been assaulted after having their food or drinks spiked. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave food or drinks unattended and pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Get urgent medical help if you suspect drink spiking. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Personal or commercial disputes sometimes lead to threats of physical violence or death. Have a clear agreement on the expected level of service. Report any threats to police.
* Travellers have been robbed withdrawing money from ATMs. Credit and debit card fraud and card skimming happen across Vietnam. Taxi and gambling scams are also common. Only use ATMs in banks and shopping centres. Always keep your credit card in sight. Use metered or prearranged taxis, especially at airports. Report gambling scams to police.
* During the rainy season (June to November), floods, typhoons, and severe weather can disrupt essential services and transportation and impact infrastructure. If you're in an affected area, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time.

* Rabies occurs in Vietnam, especially in the north. It’s fatal without treatment. If you’re bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

### Local laws

* Don’t use or carry illegal drugs, including marijuana. Penalties for drug offences include the death penalty and life imprisonment. Never carry parcels or luggage for others. It is a crime to have drugs in your system, and you can also be charged for using drugs, even if it was outside of Vietnam.
* Get professional legal advice before signing any contract. If you're in a business or civil dispute, officials could stop you leaving Vietnam until it’s resolved.
* It's illegal to gamble in a non-government licensed casino or possess pornography. Non-state sanctioned political or religious activity or material, or involvement with groups perceived by the Government of Vietnam to be associated with dissident groups, is also illegal.
* It’s illegal to export antiques without a permit. Get a permit from the [Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism](https://english.bvhttdl.gov.vn/). It’s illegal to photograph border areas or military sites. Be careful when taking photos.
* Possessing or distributing images or objects linked to the former Republic of Vietnam, including commemorative or Vietnam War service-related items, is an offence that could attract harsh penalties.
* Vietnam recognises dual nationality in limited situations. If you're a dual national, travel on your Australian passport. You may need to do compulsory military service. Contact your nearest [Vietnamese embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) for details.

### Travel

* You must have an appropriate visa before travelling to Vietnam. You can [apply online](https://thithucdientu.gov.vn/) for an eVisa for tourism or business purposes. If approved, the eVisa may allow you to stay up to 90 days and is valid for single or multiple entries. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Vietnam for the latest details.
* You must check your details are correct when applying for a visa. Before your travel, ensure that the visa details match exactly the information on your passport's biodata page, such as your full name and date of birth. Any errors or name omissions may result in an additional fee, refusal of boarding, or refusal of entry on arrival. You may be charged a significant fee at check-in or on arrival to correct the visa error.
* On arrival, your passport will be stamped with the date that indicates when you must exit Vietnam. You must check that the visa expiration date written on your passport is correct before leaving immigration/border control, as this date may vary from what is shown on your visa. You could be charged a fine for overstaying if the expiry date is incorrect.
* If you're travelling with prescription medication, check the value and quantity restrictions on the import and export of prescription medication with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217).
