#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some addictive and psychotropic medications are controlled.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Vietnam. Take enough legal medicine for your trip and always carry it in its original packaging.

If you are travelling with prescription medication, check the value and quantity restrictions on the import and export of prescription medication with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217).

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Measles and Diphtheria

Localised outbreaks of measles and diphtheria can occur in Vietnam.

Seek medical advice to ensure your vaccinations and those of your children are up-to-date.

* [Measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles) (HealthDirect)

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) continues to be a risk. There's no vaccination for it.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends you:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

[Dengue](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue) is found, especially in the south. There's no vaccine or treatment.

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) is also found. To protect yourself, consider getting vaccinated. A vaccine is available in Australia.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in some remote mountainous areas.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Discuss your travel plans and other vaccination needs with your doctor before you travel.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is potentially fatal if you don't get vaccinated or receive quick treatment.

Rabies is found in infected dogs, monkeys, bats and other mammals.

Most reported cases are in the mountain areas of northern Vietnam. It's most commonly passed on through dog bites.

To reduce your risk of rabies, don't go near dogs and other mammals.

If you're bitten or scratched, seek medical help immediately.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is a risk.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to risk of infection.

#### Hand, foot and mouth disease

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) is common. Sometimes more serious outbreaks happen.

Outbreaks usually peak from March to May and from September to December.

HFMD mostly affects children under the age of 10 years. Adult cases, especially young adults, are not unusual.

The illness appears as a fever, blisters and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.

HFMD is spread by direct contact with nose and throat discharges and faeces of infected people.

To reduce the risk of getting or passing on HFMD, pay close attention to hygiene. Wash your hands well and often.

#### Bird flu (avian influenza)

Human cases of [avian influenza](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/avian-influenza-bird-flu) or 'bird flu' are reported in Vietnam.

#### Cholera and other health risks

Acute watery diarrhoea and [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) occur.

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Seek urgent medical attention if you have a fever or diarrhoea or you suspect food poisoning.

#### Air pollution

There can be high levels of air pollution, up to and including hazardous levels, in major cities, especially during January to March. Pollution can increase the risk of breathing problems. People with pre-existing medical conditions, particularly heart and lung conditions, may be affected.

If you're concerned about the levels of air pollution:

* seek medical advice
* follow advice from local authorities about methods to reduce exposure
* monitor an air quality index
* reduce your exposure

#### Drugs

Drug use has been reported to cause psychotic episodes and hospitalisation.

If you use drugs in Vietnam, you face possible health and legal risks. See [Local laws](#local-laws).

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities and care varies, is generally below Australian standards, and may lack medicine and supplies.

Foreign private medical clinics are available in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang. They may not meet Australian standards.

Medical facilities and care at most public hospitals are poor. This is especially true outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

You may need medical evacuation to a major centre, even for minor operations.

Doctors and hospitals expect payment before providing medical services, including for emergency care.

Some hospitals may talk with your travel insurance company to secure payment. Others may need up-front payment before they will start treating you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to Bangkok or Singapore. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

You may need to show a [legalised birth certificate](/consular-services/notarial-services/documents-overseas "Notarial services (legalising documents) overseas") to be recognised as next of kin for medical consent purposes.
