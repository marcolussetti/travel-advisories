#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

To enter Vietnam, you must have either a:

* visa
* visa exemption certificate

Australian passport holders are not able to obtain visas on arrival in Vietnam.

Learn more about [visa requirements.](https://visa.mofa.gov.vn/Homepage.aspx)

You can now apply for an eVisa for tourism or business purposes. It allows eligible travellers to stay up to 90 days in Vietnam if granted. The eVisa is valid for single or multiple entries.

You can complete the [visa application form](https://vietnamembassy.org.au/en/visa-viet-nam) online. As there have been reports of difficulties in accessing eVisas during airport check-in, once granted, you should consider printing a hard copy of the visa approval document.

Check your details - once when lodging your visa and again when you receive your visa.

* When applying for a visa, make sure you enter your details correctly. The visa details must match exactly the information on your passport's biodata page, such as your full name and date of birth.
* When you're issued a visa to enter Vietnam, check again that all your Vietnam visa details are correct, match the information in your passport, that your full name is listed, and that there are no spelling or other errors.

Any errors or name omissions may result in an additional fee, refusal of boarding, or refusal of entry on arrival. You may be charged a significant fee at check-in or on arrival to correct the visa error.

For stays longer than 90 days, please contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Vietnam.

If your visa expires or is no longer valid, you may be detained and/or fined when leaving.

The Australian Government cannot sponsor your visa application or extension.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) for details about visas, currency and customs.

You must register your place of residence with local police within 24 hours of arrival. Check that your hotel does this as part of the check-in process. Register at the local police station if you're staying in private accommodation.

#### Visa scams

Travellers have been scammed by private online visa services and travel agents.

Only apply for your visa through the [Government of Vietnam’s official website](https://vietnamembassy.org.au/en/visa-viet-nam) or offices.

#### Vietnamese spouse or parent visas

If your spouse or parent is a Vietnamese national, you can apply for a visa exemption certificate.

#### Changes to visa status and visa extensions

You can't change the status of your entry visa to any other visa type in Vietnam. For example, you can't change a tourist or a spouse visa to a working visa.

Vietnam does not issue automatic visa extensions. If your visa has expired, contact the Vietnamese immigration authorities to make arrangements to exit Vietnam. Visa extensions are only possible before your visa expiry date.

To get a visa extension from the Vietnamese immigration authorities, your passport must have at least 6 months validity left at the time of application.

This requirement is subject to change.

Check with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) for details.

#### Border measures

Travel and entry requirements may change rapidly. Contact your nearest [Vietnamese Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) for details on entry and exit requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Import and export of prescription medication

If you are travelling with prescription medication, check the value and quantity restrictions on the import and export of prescription medication with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217).

#### Register place of residence

All foreigners must register their place of residence with the local police within 24 hours of arrival.

The Australian embassy and consulate can't provide translation services to help with registration.

If you stay at a hotel, check that you'll be registered as part of the normal check-in process. They'll need your passport details.

Many hotels ask foreigners to leave their passport with hotel staff for registration purposes. It isn't a legal requirement for hotels to keep your passport for the time you stay there.

If you stay with family, friends or in another private residence, you need to register at the local police station. Use a translator if needed.

Local hosts need to pre-register foreign guests. If you stay in a private residence, make sure your host has followed this legal requirement.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost and stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

Keep a photocopy (or photograph) of your passport bio page and visa somewhere separately in case you lose your passport.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Vietnam is the Vietnamese Dong (VND).

When you arrive or exit Vietnam, declare:

* foreign currency in excess of $US5,000, including cash and traveller's cheques
* more than 15 million Vietnamese dong

If you carry more currency or gold than you declared, authorities could confiscate it. They could arrest or fine you.

These requirements may be subject to change. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) for details.

Credit cards are widely accepted throughout major cities in Vietnam.

ATMs are widespread in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang.

Check with your bank to confirm if your ATM (eftpos) card will work in Vietnam.

Card skimming happens throughout Vietnam. See [Safety](#safety).

You may have trouble getting replacement ATM cards.

Many Australian banks don't have local or regional branches with English-speaking staff.

The Vietnamese postal services are generally unreliable. If you need a new card, consider using an international courier service. The Australian embassy or consulate can't help you with money while you wait for a new card. It can't act as a personal mail-holding service.

#### Local travel

Travel is restricted:

* in some parts of the central Highlands
* around some border areas
* near military installations

#### Long Tan Cross site

The Vietnamese Government won't permit official Long Tan commemorations at the Long Tan Cross site in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province.

Access to the site will remain open to small groups of people for private visits without media coverage. This may change at short notice.

Visitors to the site may not:

* wear medals or uniforms
* carry banners or flags

You must behave in a solemn manner, respecting the wishes of local communities.

#### Landmines and explosive remnants of war

Unexploded ordinance and landmines are a danger in former battlefields, especially in central Vietnam and along the Laos border.

Mine-free roads and paths are well-marked.

If you visit former battlefields, stay on marked pathways.

#### Driving permit

You must have a valid Vietnamese driver's licence to drive or ride in Vietnam. This includes for motorcycles of 50cc or more.

An International Driving Permit (IDP) issued in Australia is not recognised in Vietnam.

Authorities may fine you for driving without a valid licence.

Your travel insurer will likely deny any claims you make if:

* You're unlicensed and/or
* You don't hold the correct class of licence.

**More information:**

* [Australian embassy, Hanoi](http://vietnam.embassy.gov.au/hnoi/Driving_in_Vietnam.html)

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Vietnam than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* crowded streets in major cities
* drivers ignoring road rules
* poor vehicle and road maintenance

Traffic accidents often happen and attract large crowds.

If you're involved in an accident, you could face criminal charges. This is regardless of who's at fault. You may need to pay a large sum to the injured person or their family.

If you're not familiar with local conditions, avoid driving or riding a motorcycle.

Whether driving, riding or walking, be very careful when crossing busy streets. Traffic can appear from any direction.

**More information:**

* [Road Safety](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

The number of travellers involved in serious motorcycle accidents is increasing.

Check your travel insurance policy covers you when travelling by motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet that meets Australian safety standards.

Only ride motorcycles if you're:

* properly licensed (Australian driver licences or International Driver Licences issued in Australia are not accepted in Vietnam; you must hold a Vietnamese driving licence to ride a motorbike 50cc or above); and
* familiar with and comfortable in local driving conditions

#### Taxis

Be careful using taxis hailed on the street.

Major metered taxis are generally reliable. Ensure the taxi driver knows how to get to where you're going before you get in.

Check the meter is used. Leave the taxi if the driver tries to pick other passengers up.

If you book a taxi online or through an app, make sure the details of the vehicle and driver match those the company gives you.

Unless using an Australian safety standard-approved helmet, we discourage using motorcycle taxis as they provide riders with helmets that offer little to no protection against injury in the case of an accident.

Be careful of taxi scams. See [Safety](#safety).

#### Public transport

Inter-city buses have a high accident rate.

Petty theft often happens on buses. See [Safety](#safety).

When travelling by rail, keep the ticket stub as you need it when leaving the train station.

#### Sea travel

Boats, hydrofoils and ferries may not meet Australian safety standards.

Accidents on waterways happen. Vessels have sunk and people have died. This includes in Ha Long Bay.

Whenever you plan to [travel by boat](/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel "Travelling by boat"):

* ask tour operators about the safety record and emergency procedures
* make sure there is enough safety equipment such as life jackets on board
* if proper equipment is not available, use another provider

Piracy happens in coastal areas of Vietnam.

* [International Maritime Bureau piracy reports](https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre)

#### Air travel

You may need to show your luggage tags when leaving a Vietnamese airport. Keep your luggage receipt from your airline on you at all times.

By law, children under 14 years travelling alone on domestic flights must:

* bring a birth certificate
* have an authorisation letter between the legal guardian of the child and the airline confirming the child can travel alone

Contact the airline in advance to check what is needed for unaccompanied minors.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Vietnam's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=VN) with the Aviation Safety Network.
