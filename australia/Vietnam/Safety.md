# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, street crime and harassment happen, especially in larger cities.

Bag slashing is common in tourist areas, at markets, on crowded trains and buses, and at supermarkets. It increases in the lead up to and during Vietnamese and Western holiday periods.

Thieves on motorcycles commit snatch-and-grab crimes against pedestrians. This happens often and sometimes results in injury.

Thieves steal valuables, such as jewellery, handbags, mobile phones and cameras.

To protect your belongings:

* take care crossing the street or walking along footpaths
* be aware of motorcycles approaching from behind as you walk on the footpath
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in ways that make them harder to snatch
* carry only what you need and leave other valuables in a secure location
* be prepared to surrender your valuables rather than risk being injured in a struggle

#### Violent crime

Aggravated theft, [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and [assault](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas") happen. Hot spots include:

* Hanoi
* Ho Chi Minh City
* Da Nang
* Nha Trang
* Sapa, especially on the train to and from Lao Cai
* Cat Ba Island, near Ha Long Bay

Reports of groping and other sexual assault are rising.

If you're a victim of a violent crime, especially sexual assault, seek medical attention. There is a risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases in Vietnam.

Although gun violence is uncommon in Vietnam, there have been isolated incidents in recent years.

#### Robbery

Travellers have been robbed after withdrawing money from ATMs.

Break-ins to hotels and private homes are reported. This happens even while guests are in their rooms.

To protect yourself from [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"):

* only use ATMs in banks and shopping centres
* make sure your hotel room is locked at all times, including when you're inside
* pay close attention to your personal belongings, especially in crowded areas
* be alert on overnight trains and buses and on quiet stretches of road

Report thefts straight away to the local police and hotel management.

#### Disputes

Personal or commercial arguments sometimes lead to threats of physical violence or death.

If you're threatened with violence, report it to local police.

To avoid commercial disputes, have a clear agreement on what the expected level of service is.

#### Scams

Many travellers have become victims of credit and debit card, taxi and gambling [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers").

Credit and debit card skimming is where card data is taken for use in fraudulent transactions. This happens throughout Vietnam.

Some Australians have lost thousands of dollars after accepting invitations to private homes from friendly locals. Beware of rigged card games and other confidence tricks organised by criminals.

Gambling may break local laws, which also apply to travellers. See [Local laws](#local-laws).

To avoid credit and debit card scams:

* keep your credit card in sight at all times
* don't share or show your PIN to others, especially when using ATMs
* check your transaction statements

At airports, use airport taxis, prearranged hotel transfer services, taxis from clearly marked taxi ranks with staff, or one reserved through a car booking app.

Check that any person holding a placard with your name on it knows where you are going.

Be careful of people who are overly friendly and invite you to their home.

If you're a victim of a gambling scam, report it to local police.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at low risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Drink spiking occurs. Foreigners have been robbed and sexually assaulted after having spiked food and drinks. This happens at late-night establishments in major cities.

If you think your drink or a friend's drink has been spiked, get urgent medical attention.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Although rare, protests sometimes happen.

Don't take photos of demonstrations, the military or the police. Authorities may not tolerate this.

Some localised violent clashes between protesters and police have resulted in casualties. The most recent incident occurred in Đắk Lắk Province in June 2023, when several police were killed in organised attacks on police stations.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

#### Terrorism

There's a low threat of terrorism in Vietnam.  However, terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators' safety and maintenance standards may not meet your expectations. This can include adventure activities, such as mountain climbing and boat trips.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Vietnam experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* flash floods
* [landslides](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [typhoons](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

Severe weather events can disrupt air, sea, road and rail transport, electricity and communications.

If there's a natural disaster:

* always carry your passport in a waterproof bag
* keep in regular touch with family and friends
* check the media and other local sources for information
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Flooding and typhoons

[Floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), flash flooding, typhoons and severe weather are common during the rainy season, from June to November.

Flooding can lead to landslides including in built up and residential areas of towns and villages.

Typhoons mostly affect the coastal areas of the north and central regions. Though less common, typhoons also can occur in the south.

Monitor the media, and weather and flood level reports during the rainy season.

The [Mekong River Commission](http://www.mrcmekong.org/) gives information on flood levels for the Mekong River region.

If there's a flood, typhoon or severe weather:

* don't enter the affected areas without getting advice from local authorities
* check with tour operators before travelling to affected areas
* if in doubt about the safety of any location, change your travel plans.

#### Tsunamis

Large, frequent earthquakes in the region make destructive tsunamis more likely.

Be alert to warnings. A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake.

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/).

Move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Do not wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media.

If there's a tsunami or if a tsunami warning is current, check the [US Tsunami Warning System](https://www.tsunami.gov/).
