# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

You can be detained or held without formal charges for lengthy periods while under police investigation. In some cases, you won’t be allowed to make a phone call and our ability to provide consular assistance during the investigation period will be limited.

#### Drugs

There are strict security and investigative measures to stop drug trafficking.

Penalties for all types of drug offences, including those with small amounts of drugs, are severe. Many drug offences attract the death penalty or life in jail.

It is a crime to have drugs in your system, and you can also be charged for using drugs, even if it was outside of Vietnam.

Marijuana in any form is illegal.

Never carry parcels or luggage for others.

For information about carrying prescription medications into Vietnam, see '[Travel](#travel)'.

#### Marriage laws

Foreigners who want to marry a Vietnamese citizen in Vietnam must get formal approval from the Department of Justice. This must be done in the province where the Vietnamese citizen is registered.

You also need a [Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage (CNI)](/consular-services/notarial-services/cni "Certificates of No Impediment (CNI) to Marriage") if you plan to marry in Vietnam.

Apply for a CNI through the:

* [Australian Embassy](http://www.vietnam.embassy.gov.au/) in Hanoi
* [Australian Consulate-General](http://www.hcmc.vietnam.embassy.gov.au/) in Ho Chi Minh City

You can also apply for the CNI from [DFAT in Australia.](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services")  Fees apply. The [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) in Australia needs to authenticate it. Only then will the Department of Justice in Vietnam recognise it.

#### Business laws

Increased Australian business activity has resulted in a higher number of commercial disputes in recent years.

If you're thinking about entering into a contract, get professional legal advice.

If you're involved in a business or civil dispute, authorities could stop you from leaving Vietnam until you resolve the matter.

#### Employment

Disputes over alleged misrepresentation of working and living conditions for Australians working in Vietnam often happen. This is especially the case for people teaching English.

Before signing an employment contract or travelling to Vietnam for work, verify the true nature of the work you're offered.

Check for unacceptable employment conditions. For example, conditions for early termination may state that you surrender your right to a return air ticket. Your potential employer may also withhold your pay.

To safeguard your stay, also:

* check the living arrangements your potential employer has offered
* make sure you have the correct visa before arriving — ask an [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217)
* get professional legal advice before signing any contract
* get all the work permits you need

The [Australian embassy or consulate-general](https://vietnam.embassy.gov.au/) can provide a limited range of [notarial services](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") for some documents needed for a work permit.

Never hand over your passport to your employer, even for safekeeping. Reputable businesses won't ask you to hand over your passport.

Make sure you keep a valid visa and work permit. If you don't, authorities will fine you and could detain you.

#### Other laws

Penalties for serious crime, such as rape, espionage and hijacking, may include the death penalty.

It's illegal to:

* take photos at border crossings or military installations
* go too close to the border with China, Cambodia or Laos without prior written permission from the local authorities
* gamble, except in government-licensed casinos where foreign passport holders can gamble
* possess pornography
* possess non-state sanctioned political or religious material
* bring, sell, use or distribute electronic cigarettes, vaping devices and vaping liquids in Vietnam

These activities may result in arrest and imprisonment.

Taking part in unsanctioned religious activities, including online, is against the law. Any involvement with non-state sanctioned political organisations, or groups perceived by the Government of Vietnam to be associated with dissident groups is also illegal. If authorities suspect you of involvement in these activities, they could stop you from entering the country, detain or deport you. Authorities could also stop you from leaving, place you under surveillance or subject you to interrogation until an investigation has been completed.

It's illegal to export antiques without a permit. The [Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism](https://english.bvhttdl.gov.vn/) offers advice and necessary permits.

Possessing or distributing images or objects linked to the former Republic of Vietnam, including commemorative or Vietnam War service-related items, is an offence that could attract harsh penalties.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

Same-sex partners aren't legally protected or recognised.

#### Dual citizenship

Vietnam recognises dual nationality in limited situations.

If you're a dual citizen and you enter Vietnam on a Vietnamese passport, it limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained. Vietnamese authorities may not tell us of your situation.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Australian citizens must re-enter Australia on an Australian passport.

If you're a dual national, you may need to do compulsory military service in Vietnam.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Vietnam](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/217) in Australia before you travel.
