#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Albania. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Ticks in forests and country areas can carry encephalitis. Ticks are active from spring to autumn.

Diseases spread by sandflies are common in coastal regions. Sandflies can carry:

* sandfly fever
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

During and after travelling in forested areas:

* check your body for ticks
* remove ticks from your body as soon as possible

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/node/348) are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid unpasteurised dairy products
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't go near dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, seek medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Standards of hygiene and medical facilities are lower than in Australia.

There's limited access to medical equipment, medicine and specialist doctors.

Medical facilities outside Tirana are limited.

Medical facilities can rarely handle serious trauma or major medical care cases.

Ambulances are limited. Patients often take taxis or other vehicles to the nearest major hospital.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be expensive and hard to organise.
