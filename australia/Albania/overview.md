## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorists have targeted European cities, including transport hubs and tourist locations. Take official warnings seriously.
* Political protests could take place in central Tirana. Most demonstrations are peaceful, but they can turn violent. Monitor local media for the latest updates.
* Theft from vehicles is common. Petty crime occurs. Take care of your belongings on public transport.
* Severe weather occurs from December to February and may cause flooding, particularly in northern Albania. Monitor the local media and stay in touch with friends and family.
* Mountain activities, such as hiking and rock climbing, can be dangerous, especially if you're unprepared. Trails aren't always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even in summer. You should hire an experienced guide from a reputable company. Never hike alone.

### Health

* Take care in forests and rural areas where ticks carry encephalitis. Ticks are active from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks and remove them as soon as possible.
* Sandflies are active along the coast. They carry diseases. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Tuberculosis, typhoid, hepatitis, brucellosis and rabies are common. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities don't always have access to equipment, medicine and specialist doctors, and ambulances are limited. Organising a medical evacuation can be expensive and difficult. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.
