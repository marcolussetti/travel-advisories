## Overview

### Safety

* A State of Exception is periodically declared in some municipalities in Honduras. When there's a State of Exception, there may be restrictions on freedom of movement and other rights. Monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions in specific neighbourhoods. You must always carry identification and comply with all local laws and police instructions.
* Violent crime is widespread. Carjackers and armed robbers may target people travelling to and from the airport or at traffic lights. Arrive and depart the airport in daylight. Always keep vehicle doors and windows locked. Don't walk outside or travel after dark.
* Borders and remote areas have higher risks of violent crime due to drug smuggling. Only use official border crossings. Cross during daytime.
* You're at risk of food and drink spiking. Never leave your food or drinks unattended. Petty crime, including robbery at ATMs, is common. Only use ATMs in secure areas, such as hotels, banks and shopping centres during daytime.
* Demonstrations can turn violent. It's illegal for foreigners to take part in political protests. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Express kidnappings and robberies can occur in the urban areas of Honduras. They are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.
* The hurricane season is June to November. Hurricanes can cause landslides, mudslides and flooding. Know where your nearest shelter is. Follow the advice of local authorities.

* HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities. Other infectious diseases include hepatitis and typhoid. Drink boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Air pollution is severe during the dry season. If you have breathing problems, talk to your doctor.

### Travel

* To enter Honduras, you must purchase a tourist card at the airport. This allows you to visit Honduras for up to 90 days. If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Honduras for the latest details.
* Both sides of the Honduras-Nicaragua border have unmarked minefields. Don't leave known safe roads and areas.
* Only use the airport or pre-booked taxis. Avoid hailing taxis from the street and public transport. Vehicles are often poorly serviced, and drivers aren't trained.
