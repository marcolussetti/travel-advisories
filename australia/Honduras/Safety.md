#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is widespread in Honduras. This includes:

* murder
* [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [burglary](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)
* [carjacking](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged)
* [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault)

Crime often involves firearms and street gangs. There have been mass shootings in urban centres.

Honduras has very high rates of murder. Take safety precautions.

Travellers have been affected by violent crime:

* in and around San Pedro Sula — including when leaving the airport
* on the ferry from La Ceiba to the Bay Islands
* in Tegucigalpa
* in Tela
* in Trujillo
* near the Copan ruins

Active criminal groups mean murder rates are high in:

* the Chamelecon district, south of San Pedro Sula
* Choloma
* Cofradia

Violent crime is common in remote and border areas of Honduras. There are often no police or security services.

Cross-border drug smuggling increases the danger in:

* Olancho, Colon and Gracias a Dios in the east
* Cortes and Copan in the west
* Valle and Choluteca in the south

Local police may not respond to violent crime. Help for victims can be limited.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't walk outside or travel after dark
* pay attention to your surroundings, especially in isolated and remote areas
* only use official border crossings
* leave valuables and your passport in a secure place
* avoid talking about your travel plans in public

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get medical help straight away. Honduras has a high risk of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Express kidnappings can occur in the urban areas of Honduras, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Other crime

Honduran urban and rural roads and highways are dangerous.

Armed robbery, car jackings and bus jackings occur.

Carjackers may target you leaving a major airport. You may be robbed at traffic lights or by criminals pretending to be injured.

Travellers have been sexually assaulted, often following spiking of food or drink. These incidents are on the rise.

It's more dangerous at night. Travelling by bus or car is risky after dark:

* in San Pedro Sula
* in Tegucigalpa
* in other major cities
* at beach resorts

If you're walking alone, you could be at risk of violent crime.

To stay safe:

* travel in groups
* arrive or depart airports in daylight
* never hitchhike or accept rides from strangers
* keep car windows and doors locked
* travel in convoy
* do not travel after dark

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, like pickpocketing and bag-snatching, is common. You're at risk:

* in airports
* at hotels
* in bus terminals
* in shopping malls
* at other crowded public venues

You may be robbed at an ATM.

To reduce your risks when withdrawing or changing money:

* use ATMs in daylight hours
* withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks or shopping centres

Report problems to the police.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. If criminals have guns or weapons, they may injure or kill you. People have been killed and injured resisting criminals. It is useful to carry a small amount of cash to hand out if you’re robbed.

The Bay Islands are generally safer than mainland Honduras. Crime is lower, but petty crime is common. Tourists can be the victims of violent crime. Theft from homes and long-term rentals happens.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Honduras. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It's illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Honduras.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests and public gatherings
* check the media for reports of unrest
* follow advice from local authorities

If you see a protest, leave as soon as it's safe.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Earthquakes

Honduras is located in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone. Minor earthquakes can cause considerable damage.

Know local earthquake safety measures for each place you visit.

#### Water activities

Rescue services may not consistently meet international standards, and unpredictable tidal changes can result in powerful currents and common riptides. Lifeguards and warning flags may not be present on all beaches to signal hazardous conditions.

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not adhere strictly to international standards. When engaging in adventure sports such as diving. Choose a reputable company with proper insurance coverage.
