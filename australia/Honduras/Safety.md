#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is widespread in Honduras. This includes:

* murder
* [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [burglary](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)
* [carjacking](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged)
* [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault)

Crime often involves firearms and street gangs. There have been mass shootings in urban centres.

Honduras has very high rates of murder. Take safety precautions.

Travellers have been sexually assaulted, often following spiking of food or drink. These incidents are on the rise.

Travellers have been affected by violent crime:

* in and around San Pedro Sula — including when leaving the airport
* on the ferry from La Ceiba to the Bay Islands
* in Tegucigalpa
* in Tela
* in Trujillo
* near the Copan ruins

Active criminal groups mean murder rates are high in:

* the Chamelecon district, south of San Pedro Sula
* Choloma
* Cofradia

Violent crime is common in remote and border areas of Honduras. There are often no police or security services.

Cross-border drug smuggling increases the danger in:

* Olancho, Colon and Gracias a Dios in the east
* Cortes and Copan in the west
* Valle and Choluteca in the south

Local police may not respond to violent crime. Help for victims can be limited.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't walk outside or travel after dark
* pay attention to your surroundings, especially in isolated and remote areas
* only use official border crossings
* leave valuables and your passport in a secure place
* avoid talking about your travel plans in public

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get medical help straight away. Honduras has a high risk of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection.

If you're walking alone, you could be at risk of violent crime.

To stay safe:

* travel in groups
* arrive or depart airports in daylight
* never hitchhike or accept rides from strangers
* keep car windows and doors locked
* travel in convoy
* do not travel after dark

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, like pickpocketing and bag-snatching, is common. You're at risk:

* in airports
* at hotels
* in bus terminals
* in shopping malls
* at other crowded public venues

You may be robbed at an ATM.

To reduce your risks when withdrawing or changing money:

* use ATMs in daylight hours
* withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks or shopping centres

Report problems to the police.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. If criminals have guns or weapons, they may injure or kill you. People have been killed and injured resisting criminals. It is useful to carry a small amount of cash to hand out if you’re robbed.

The Bay Islands are generally safer than mainland Honduras. Crime is lower, but petty crime is common. Tourists can be the victims of violent crime. Theft from homes and long-term rentals happens.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Honduras. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Safety Tips for Women Travelers

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Express [kidnappings](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) can occur in urban areas in Honduras, and are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. Victims are forced to withdraw money from ATMs to secure their release. If threatened, do not resist.

Use only well-known radio taxi companies with the phone number displayed on the vehicle's roof or ride-sharing applications. Don't hail taxis off the street.  Note the taxi's registration number and phone number.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings – avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don’t set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share you location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* if you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).  

The Australian Government’s longstanding policy is that it doesn’t make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It's illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Honduras.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests and public gatherings
* check the media for reports of unrest
* follow advice from local authorities

If you see a protest, leave as soon as it's safe.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:
