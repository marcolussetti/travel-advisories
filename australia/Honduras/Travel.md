#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need to purchase a tourist card at the airport. This allows you to visit Honduras for up to 90 days. The maximum 90-day period is not guaranteed, and the decision on entry and visa duration is at the discretion of immigration authorities. 

Honduras is a member country to the Central American Border Control Agreement (CA-4), along with:

* [El Salvador](/destinations/americas/el-salvador "El Salvador")
* [Guatemala](/destinations/americas/guatemala "Guatemala")
* [Nicaragua](/destinations/americas/nicaragua "Nicaragua")

With a CA-4 tourist visa, you can travel freely by land between member countries within the 90-day period.

Your tourist card is dated from the first point of entry in any member country.

You can apply to extend the CA-4 visa before it expires at the [National Institute of Migration (Spanish)](http://inm.gob.hn/).

If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact an embassy or consulate of Honduras for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. The Australian Government cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements. 

#### Border measures

Make sure your passport is stamped on entry to Honduras. You may face a fine and delays if you fail to present an entry-stamped passport when departing Honduras.

On arrival and departure, you need to complete a pre-check form online at the [Honduran National Institute of Migration website](https://prechequeo.inm.gob.hn/Login) (available in English). You'll need to print out the confirmation email to present at the airport.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the [US](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/united-states-america), ensure you meet all current US entry or transit requirements, including if you are transiting through Hawaii.

#### Travel via Canada

If you're travelling via [Canada](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/canada), ensure you meet all entry and transit requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Travel with children

Children aged under 21 travelling to or from Honduras alone or with only one parent or guardian must have permission from both legal guardians. They'll need a notarised letter of consent that meets language (Spanish) and other requirements.

Contact an embassy or consulate of Honduras for details.

#### Airport service fees

Before you fly out of Honduras, you must pay an airport service fee if you're aged over 12.

Your ticket may include the service fee. If it doesn't, you'll need to pay at the airport with US dollars or local currency.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

If you arrive from a country where yellow fever is a risk, you'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Honduras. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who can use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport.

Always keep your passport in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, contact the local police and make a report. You'll also need to tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Lempira (HNL).

You can't exchange Australian dollars in Honduras. Bring US dollars or Euros.

You'll need to show your passport or a certified copy of your passport to exchange money.

Credit cards are widely accepted. Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work.

ATMs are available in major centres. Check your bank statements for ATM fraud.

#### Local travel

Honduran urban and rural roads and highways are dangerous.

Armed robbery, car jackings and bus jackings occur.

Carjackers may target you leaving a major airport. You may be robbed at traffic lights or by criminals pretending to be injured.

It's more dangerous at night. Travelling by bus or car is risky after dark:

* in San Pedro Sula
* in Tegucigalpa
* in other major cities
* at beach resorts

#### Local restrictions

A State of Exception is periodically declared in various municipalities in Honduras to reduce crime. During this time, restrictions on freedom of movement (curfews) and other rights may be restricted. Monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions in specific neighbourhoods. You must always carry identification and comply with all local laws and police instructions.

#### Tour operators

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Honduras, you need both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get the IDP before arriving in Honduras.

#### Road travel

Driving in Honduras can be dangerous.

Hazards include:

* poor roads
* poor signs and lighting
* people and farm animals on the roads

Driving at night is dangerous.

Heavy rains, flooding, landslides and bridge collapses often damage roads.

Take route CA13 when travelling from the airport in San Pedro Sula.

Carjackings, busjackings and highway robberies are common, especially at night.

If you plan to drive:

* check your travel insurance covers it
* learn local traffic laws and practices

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance may not cover you for accidents on a motorbike or quad bike. Check your insurance covers it.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis flagged from the street or at taxi stands may not be safe.

Use airport taxis or pre-book with a reputable company.

Airport taxi drivers wear clearly identifiable photo ID badges.

Taxi drivers often don't provide change, so be prepared to pay with small notes.

To safely use taxis:

* arrange your airport pickup with your hotel before you arrive
* note your taxi driver's name and licence number
* agree on the fare before you set off
* never share a taxi with a stranger
* don't let your driver pick up other passengers
* don't use white street taxis

#### Public transport

Public transport is not safe. Vehicles are often poorly serviced and drivers aren't trained.

#### Landmines

There are unmarked mine fields on both sides of the Honduras-Nicaragua border, especially in:

* the Rio Coco region
* the Choluteca and El Paraiso provinces
* the area near the Atlantic Coast

Don't leave known safe roads and areas.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Honduras's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=HR) with the Aviation Safety Network.
