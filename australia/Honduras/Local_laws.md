# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, such as possession, use, or trafficking are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

Same-sex relationships are legal in Honduras, but the country is conservative.

Same-sex marriages aren't recognised in Honduras.

It's not illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
