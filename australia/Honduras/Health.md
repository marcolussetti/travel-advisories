#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Honduras. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Keep medicines in their original packaging with a clear label.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

You could be refused entry or prosecuted if you arrive without a prescription for your medication.

#### Health Risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread in Honduras.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk throughout Honduras, including the Bay Islands. The risk increases during the rainy season, from May to November.

Other insect-borne diseases are present, including:

* [dengue](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue)
* [chikungunya](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/chikungunya-virus)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose and light-coloured clothing

Consider taking anti-malaria medication.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk in Honduras.

Protect yourself if you are at risk of infection.

#### Rabies

There's a high risk of [rabies](http://www.who.int/rabies/en/) in Honduras. Avoid direct contact with all animals, especially:

* dogs
* cats
* bats

Get urgent medical attention if you're bitten or scratched.

While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals and closely supervising children. 

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks occur from time to time.

Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink water from a sealed bottle
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* make sure your vaccinations are up to date
* avoid getting water into your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated
* avoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Air pollution

Severe air pollution happens in Honduras during the dry season.

This can lead to respiratory problems. Before you travel, discuss the risks and how to manage them with your doctor.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula are poor. Services outside these areas are extremely limited.

You usually need to pay cash upfront before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

Doctors will rarely agree to work with your travel insurer. You may need to be reimbursed after you pay cash for your treatment. Doctors may only speak Spanish.

If you are seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be expensive. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

A full hyperbaric chamber is available on Roatan island. There are decompression facilities on the Bay Island of Utila.

Before diving, check that these facilities are operating. There is no advanced medical care on either island for diving accidents.
