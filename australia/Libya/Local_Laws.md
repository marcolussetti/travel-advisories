# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.Â Our ability to provide consular services in Libya is severely limited.

Ongoing unrest restricts your access to consular help if you're arrested in Libya.

The rule of law has not been re-established in Libya. Police services may not be operating in all parts of the country.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty or life in jail.

#### Business disputes

If you're involved in a business dispute, officials may:

* confiscate your passport
* not let you leave Libya until the dispute is settled

#### Other laws

Serious crimes may attract the death penalty.

Other penalties may appear harsh by Australian standards.

In Libya, it's illegal to:

* have sex outside of marriage

You could be jailed for sexual relations outside of marriage.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Libya doesn't recognise dual citizenship.

Islamic law decides child custody.

Children born to Libyan fathers are Libyan citizens. They need their father's permission to leave Libya.

#### Local customs

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Libya. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
