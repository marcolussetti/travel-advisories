#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to Libya, you need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/114) for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Border measures

Officials may detain you if you can't prove you entered at an official border crossing.

We cannot offer advice on the safety of individual departure options, including any flights that become available, or on travel to a departure point. You should make your own judgement about the safest route out of the country, taking account of the advice of local authorities.

#### Passport registration

If you travel to Libya despite our advice, you must register your passport with a police station on arrival.

If it's safe to do so, go to the police station closest to the place you're staying. Failure to do so may result in fines and problems during your stay or on departure.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Libya if you arrive from a country with a risk of yellow fever. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Leaving safely

Australians in Libya should leave as soon as it's possible and safe to do so.

#### Air

Air travel and airport operations are subject to disruption. Check with your travel provider about route options and airport operations at your planned point of arrival or departure.

#### Road

Don't attempt to leave Libya via borders with Algeria, Chad, Sudan, or Niger. There's a very high threat of [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping").

All border crossings can close without warning. Plan for delays and temporary road closures.

The road between Tripoli and Zawiya is vulnerable to attack. Convoys, including diplomatic convoys, have been attacked.

If you plan to cross the border to Tunisia at the Ras Jedir checkpoint, plan your journey carefully. Check the border crossing is open before you leave. Be prepared for armed clashes at or on the way to the border.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Travel via Israel

If your passport shows entry to Israel, you won't be able to enter Libya.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Libyan Dinar (LYD).

Libya is a cash economy.

Credit card use is limited.

It's illegal to import and export the local currency. You can import foreign currency if you declare, but you can't export more than what you declared on arrival.

Withdrawing money from banks may be difficult due to severe shortages of cash. The security situation sometimes disrupts banking services.

Traveller's cheques aren't accepted. There are few ATMs.

#### Local travel

#### Proof of identity

You must always carry identification documents.

#### Landmines

Unexploded remnants of war, including landmines, are a hazard throughout Libya.

#### Road travel

Borders can close at short notice.

Road conditions are reasonable throughout Libya. However, driving standards are poor and traffic is heavy.

Wind-blown sand can reduce visibility quickly.
