Emergency services exist in Libya, but you shouldn't expect them to help you.

For ambulance, fire or police phone: 1415

The rule of law has not been re-established in Libya. Police services may not be operating in all parts of the country.

#### Consular contacts

The ability of the Australian Government to provide consular help to Australians in Libya is extremely limited.  
We don't have an Australian diplomatic mission in Libya.Â   
Ongoing unrest limits our consular help to Australians who are in Libya.

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

For consular advice, contact the Australian Embassy in Rome, Italy.
