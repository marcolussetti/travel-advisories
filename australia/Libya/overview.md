## Overview

### Safety

* Violent fighting is widespread and ongoing in Libya. The security situation is very unstable. There's a high threat of terrorist attack, kidnapping and crime. Do not travel to Libya. If you stay in Libya, despite our advice, seek professional security advice. Monitor the media for updated information about the security situation.
* Ongoing unrest in Libya limits our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians. If you're in Libya and it's safe to do so, leave as soon as possible.
* Areas of Libya that border Algeria, Niger, Chad and Sudan are very dangerous. Bandits and armed tribal groups operate in these areas. There's also a very high threat of kidnapping.
* If you are in a conflict zone, shelter in place until it is safe to leave, carry emergency supplies including food and water, and ensure your travel documents are valid and kept secure.
* It's illegal to drink alcohol in Libya. If you decide to consume alcohol despite our advice, you should be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning from consuming alcoholic drinks.
* Libya experiences severe weather. If you travel to Libya despite our advice, follow regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.

### Health

* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. They include Leishmaniasis, West Nile virus, typhoid, hepatitis, tuberculosis, plague and measles. Only drink boiled or bottled water. Don't swim in freshwater.
* Medical facilities in Libya are limited. Some medicines are in short supply, particularly for chronic conditions. Carry some medical supplies for personal use.
* If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your insurance covers this. Medical evacuations can be expensive and hard to organise.

### Local laws

* The rule of law has not been re-established in Libya. Police services may not operate in all areas.
* Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty or life imprisonment. This also applies to other serious offences like murder.
* Libya may not recognise dual citizenship.
* Women without a male guardian may be restricted in their ability to travel.
* Officials may seize your passport if you're involved in a business dispute. They may not let you leave Libya until the dispute is settled.
* Many activities are illegal in Libya. This includes same-sex sexual activity and drinking alcohol. You could be jailed for having sex outside marriage.
* Islamic law decides child custody. A child born to a Libyan father is a Libyan citizen. They need their father's permission to leave Libya.

### Travel

* If you travel to Libya despite our advice, you'll need a visa. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Libya for the latest details.
* We can't advise you on the safety of departure options. If you plan to leave, you need to determine the safest route out of the country. In certain areas (where fighting occurs), the best course of action may be to stay where you are until it becomes safer to move on.
* Airports and land border crossings can close without warning. Plan for delays and temporary closures.
* Trying to leave Libya via land borders is very dangerous. There's a high threat of kidnapping in regions bordering Algeria, Chad, Sudan and Niger. Don't try to leave Libya through these countries or through illegal border crossings.
* Officials may detain you if you can't prove you entered Libya at an official border crossing.
* You must always carry ID documents. Upon arrival, you need to register your passport with a police station. If you don't, you could be fined.
