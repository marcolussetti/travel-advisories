#### Travel Insurance

As Libya is a ‘do not travel’ location, standard travel insurance is unlikely to provide coverage. You should ensure your travel insurance specifically covers high-risk destinations including Libya. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Libya. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [Leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)
* [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* don't swim in fresh water
* take precautions against flea bites
* don't handle dead animals

If you suspect food poisoning, seek urgent medical attention. Also seek medical attention if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Libya are limited. Some medications are in short supply.

Medical facilities in remote areas can be basic or non-existent. Carry some medical supplies for personal use.

Foreigners must pay an up-front deposit for medical services. If you are seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and hard to organise.
