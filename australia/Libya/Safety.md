# Safety

#### Security situation

#### Violent fighting

In recent years, there have been violent clashes between armed groups across the country, including in Tripoli.

Fighting can break out anywhere without warning, and often happens at night.

If you're in Libya, your life and safety could be at risk. Some foreigners have been killed.

Militias have targeted ports, airports, and oil and gas installations.

If you travel to Libya despite our advice:

* seek professional security advice
* monitor the media for possible risks
* arrange personal security measures
* leave Libya as soon as it's safe to do so

#### Lack of consular services

We don't have an Australian diplomatic mission in Libya. Only a few diplomatic missions and international bodies are in Libya.

Our ability to provide consular services in Libya is severely limited.

Ongoing unrest restricts our capacity to give consular help to Australians who are in Libya.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism remains a serious threat in Libya. Terrorist groups engage in ongoing clashes.

Terrorists often use small arms, rocket-propelled grenades or improvised bombs. They target Libyan authorities and security interests.

Attacks on foreign interests have also occurred, including:

* hotels
* locations popular with Westerners
* remaining diplomatic interests
* international non-government organisations

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

There's an ongoing high threat of kidnapping in Libya. There is a heightened risk at border areas with Algeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan and Tunisia.

Terrorist groups are capable of conducting kidnappings within Libya and across borders. Criminal gangs also carry out kidnappings, and there is a realistic possibility that they would sell hostages on to terrorist groups.

Foreigners have been kidnapped in the past.

Possible targets include:

* mining industry employees
* aid and humanitarian workers or volunteers
* journalists and businesses
* tourists, especially where tourism is rare

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don't set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Libya's political situation remains volatile. Outbreaks of violence can occur with little warning, including in Tripoli.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

If you travel to Libya despite our advice:

* avoid protests and demonstrations
* monitor the media and other sources for possible unrest or strikes

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Crime levels in Libya are high. Law and order has broken down in most of the country.

Violent crime is widespread. Foreigners are at high risk of violent crime. Crimes include carjackings targeting foreign-owned vehicles and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") by armed groups.

#### Border-area violence

Areas of Libya that border with Algeria, Niger, Chad and Sudan are very dangerous. Avoid cross-border travel between Libya and these countries.

Bandits and armed tribal groups operate in these areas. There's also a very high threat of kidnapping.

Violence and armed robberies have been reported as vehicles leave Libya by road. This includes roads that cross into Tunisia.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

It's illegal to drink or import alcohol in Libya.

If, despite our advice, you decide to consume alcoholic drinks in Libya, be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Methanol poisoning incidents occur from time to time, resulting in serious injuries and deaths.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged. Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, have been poisoned.
