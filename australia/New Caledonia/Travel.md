#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You likely won't need a visa for a tourist visit of up to 3 months. However, the total length of your stay must not exceed a total of 90 days over a period of 180 days (6 months).

You may need to show proof of:

* sufficient money for your stay
* return or onward travel ticket
* adequate travel or health insurance covering medical and hospitalisation expenses as well as any repatriation costs, including medical evacuation
* the purpose of your visit

In other situations, you'll need a visa issued by the [French representations in your country of residence](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/le-ministere-et-son-reseau/organisation-et-annuaires/ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger/) and, subject to your circumstances, a work permit issued by the Government of New Caledonia. Further information is also available (in French) on the [French High Commission in New Caledonia](https://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/Demarches/Accueil-des-etrangers) website.

New Caledonia is an overseas territory of France.

Contact the [Consulate-General of France in Sydney](https://au.ambafrance.org/-Visas-new-), [Consulate-General of France in Melbourne](https://au.ambafrance.org/-Consulate-General-in-Melbourne-) or the [Embassy of France in Canberra](https://au.ambafrance.org/-English-) for the latest details on up-to-date information on visa requirements. 

#### Border measures

Check with your airline or travel provider on minors' travel regulations, including those travelling unaccompanied.

Entry protocols apply to private sailboats and cruise ships visiting New Caledonia. All immigration procedures must be completed in Noumea, with some approvals required before arrival. During a crisis, arrivals by sea may be prohibited or restricted by local authorities. Noumea is the port of entry for private sailboats for clearance and inspection by immigration, customs and biosecurity services. Further information and contacts available in English at [New Caledonia Tourism official website – Arriving by sea](https://au.newcaledonia.travel/travel-guide/arriving-by-boat/).

Contact your airline, cruise line, local port agent, tour operator or local employer, for the latest updates.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel with the [French authorities in Australia](https://au.ambafrance.org/Contact-us-4425). If you're not sure it'll be valid for the required period, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Pacific Franc (XPF).

Declare all amounts over 10,000 euros (or equivalent) on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Australian dollars are accepted by some businesses.

Change Australian dollars for XPF at banks and authorised exchange bureaus.

There are ATMs and credit card facilities in Noumea and other major centres.

Take enough cash if you're travelling to remote areas.
