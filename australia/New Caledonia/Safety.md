# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Security situation

We advise exercise a high degree of caution in New Caledonia overall due to the risk of civil disorder and violence. We also advise reconsider your need to travel to some areas, due to an increased risk of civil disorder and violence. Political tensions and unrest may increase at short notice. There's an increased police and security presence. Authorities may impose restrictions, including curfews, at short notice. 

Significant civil disorder, violence and arson attacks occurred across New Caledonia in May 2024. Always pay close attention to your personal security and your surroundings. The security situation remains tense in New Caledonia. 

Reconsider your need to travel to the following areas due to the increased risk of civil disorder and violence.

* The Loyalty Islands
* Iles de Pins; and
* Inland of the coastal strip between Mt Dore and Kone. This includes travel on:  
  RT1 north of Kone  
  RPN2 east of Kone  
  RT3 east of Borail  
  RP5 east of Fonwhary (past access road to Farino)  
  RP4 east of Boulouparis  
  RT1 south of Noumea past St Louis

Political demonstrations and protests may turn violent at short notice. Some essential services are impacted. Follow the advice of local authorities.

Australian officials have been advised to follow heightened security measures, including while travelling through New Caledonia.

#### Demonstrations and protests

There's an ongoing risk of politically motivated protests and civil unrest.

Demonstrations and protests and other events that draw large groups of people can quickly turn violent. 

To protect yourself:

* avoid demonstrations, public gatherings and roadblocks
* monitor the media and other sources for potential unrest
* follow the advice of local authorities

Politically-motivated protests, strikes and industrial disputes can lead to social unrest. They often disrupt essential services, including:

* local transport
* domestic flights
* international flights

If there's a protest or strike:

* check for up-to-date flight information before going to the airport
* ask your tour operator if it affects tourist services
* follow the instructions of local authorities

Demonstrations and protests may increase in the days leading up to and on days of national or commemorative significance. These include: 

* Anniversary of the commencement of civil unrest (13 May)
* New Caledonia Day (24 September)

#### Swimming safety

Several shark attacks occurred in 2023. A fatal attack claimed the life of an Australian tourist in February at Chateau Royal Beach, following two similar attacks at the same beach in January and February, which resulted in life-threatening injuries.

Shark-proof nets have been installed in Noumea at sections of the Baie des Citrons and Chateau Royal-Meridien beaches. Watersports and swimming outside of these areas are permitted on an “own risk” basis. 

Both beaches are patrolled daily by lifeguards from 8.45am to 5pm during December to April and from 8.45am to 4pm during May to November. Chateau Royal-Meridien beach is open only during lifeguard surveillance hours. See the [Noumea Town Hall](https://www.noumea.nc/noumea-pratique/securite/baignade-activites-nautiques-plages-noumea) website (in French) for any updates on the lifeguard surveillance hours. Follow the advice and instructions of local authorities at all times.

More information on understanding shark safety in New Caledonia is available on the [New Caledonia Tourism](https://au.newcaledonia.travel/frequently-asked-questions/shark-safety/) website (in English). 

Beaches in New Caledonia may be closed at short notice due to bad weather, shark sightings or during shark-catching campaigns. A red flag with a shark logo means beaches have been closed due to a shark sighting or shark-related incidents. Be alert to warning signs and follow the advice of local authorities at all times.

Beach evacuation procedures in New Caledonia may be less developed than those in Australia.

[New Caledonia Tourism](https://www.newcaledonia.travel/en/risk-sharks-new-caledoniahttps://au.newcaledonia.travel/frequently-asked-questions/shark-safety/) advises visitors to:

* avoid areas where it is risky to swim, including ports, boat moorings, marinas, murky waters near drainage outlets or river mouths, and the Nouville Peninsula area in Noumea
* avoid swimming after periods of heavy rain or other weather events that agitate the water
* avoid swimming at dawn and dusk
* swim close to shore
* only swim at patrolled beaches that use a flag system.

Patrolled beaches use the following flag system:

* Green flag: supervised swimming and no particular danger
* Orange flag: supervised swimming but dangerous conditions
* Red flag: swimming is prohibited
* A red flag with a shark logo: the beach has been closed due to a shark sighting or shark-related incident.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as scuba diving.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Crime

Roadside security incidents can occur suddenly. Dangerous incidents include:

* roadblocks
* carjacking
* stone-throwing
* shooting

Major routes have been affected.

Local authorities can close major roads without warning.

#### Petty crime

Car theft, vehicle break-ins, petty thefts and household break-and-enters occur.

Drink spiking can happen. If you're drugged, you'll be more vulnerable to theft and [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault).

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* look after your belongings when you're in public
* lock your car, hide your belongings and keep windows up
* don't leave food or drinks unattended
* never accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new friends

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyclones and severe weather

Cyclone season is from November to May, but cyclones and severe weather can occur at other times.

The direction and strength of cyclones can change suddenly.

Cyclones and severe weather can bring:

* flooding waves on shore areas
* flooding and landslides
* disruptions to infrastructure and essential services

If there's a cyclone or severe tropical storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* access to seaports could also be affected
* adequate shelter may not be available

New Caledonia has a 4-phase cyclone alert system:

1. PRE-ALERT: potential cyclone activity in the weather observation zone of New Caledonia — follow weather forecasts and bulletins ([Emergency Management New Caledonia - Pre-Alert instructions in English](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/sites/default/files/documents/Anglais%20-%201%20-%20Cyclone%20-%20Consignes_Population_Prealerte.pdf))

2. ALERT 1: a cyclone is approaching and may reach New Caledonia in the next 18 hours — prepare for a cyclone ([Emergency Management New Caledonia - Alert 1 instructions in English](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/sites/default/files/documents/Anglais%20-%202%20-%20Cyclone%20-%20Consignes_Population_Alerte%201.pdf))

3. ALERT 2: a cyclone will hit New Caledonia in less than 6 hours — protect yourself and stay indoors ([Emergency Management New Caledonia – Alert 2 instructions in English](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/sites/default/files/documents/Anglais%20-%20Cyclone%20-%20Consignes_Population_Alerte%202.pdf))

4. SAFEGUARD PHASE: a cyclone is moving away — remain alert ([Emergency Management New Caledonia – Safeguard Phase instructions in English](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/sites/default/files/documents/Anglais%20-%204%20-%20Cyclone%20-%20Consignes_Population_Phase%20sauvegarde.pdf))

If a cyclone is approaching:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* identify your local shelter
* monitor [New Caledonian Department of Emergency Management (Sécurité Civile - DSCGR)](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/) (in French) with safety instructions in English for cyclone alert levels
* monitor [Météo France Nouvelle-Calédonie](http://www.meteo.nc/) (in French) for [cyclone updates](http://www.meteo.nc/nouvelle-caledonie/cyclone/bulletin)
* monitor local radio

Once the SAFEGUARD PHASE is announced:

* take care leaving your shelter
* look out for debris

#### Flooding and mudslides

Heavy rains can cause flooding and mudslides. These can lead to:

* deaths and injuries
* destruction of property
* evacuations

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

New Caledonia occasionally experiences [earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) and [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis).

Tsunamis can happen within minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake.

Ask your tour operator, host or accommodation provider about local procedures and what to do during an earthquake.

Tsunami risks are higher:

* in the East Coast
* in the Loyalty Islands
* in the Isle of Pines

To prepare yourself for earthquakes and tsunamis, you can:

* subscribe to tsunami alerts from the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/)
* get earthquake updates from the [US Geological Service](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map)
* get tsunami updates from the [US Tsunami Warning Center](https://www.tsunami.gov/)

If there's an earthquake or tsunami:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* monitor tsunami updates
* monitor local media and other sources
* move to higher ground if you're in a coastal or low-lying area

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens.

Once on high ground, monitor local media.

After an earthquake:

* expect aftershocks
* be prepared for delays and changes to your travel plans
* ask your travel agent and tour operators to confirm travel services and accommodation bookings
