#### Travel insurance

Travel insurance is mandatory for entry to New Caledonia and must cover all medical and hospitalisation expenses and repatriation costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You may need to present your travel insurance certificate when departing for and arriving in New Caledonia.

Medical costs are high. For example:

* an intensive care bed could cost more than $A5,500 per day
* ambulance transfers can cost over $A1,250
* a helicopter evacuation within New Caledonia costs over $A6,500

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) tailored to your mode of transport (e.g. cruise ship) and region of travel before you leave. Ensure your travel or medical insurance covers you for existing conditions and medical evacuation.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care and more for your return to Australia with medical assistance.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Cruise ship evacuations

Australians have been evacuated from cruise ships in New Caledonia (Noumea, Loyalty Islands or Isle of Pines) to Noumea by air ambulance and then taken by road ambulance to Gaston Bourret public hospital in Dumbea or to Kuindo-Magnin private clinic in Noumea. Some insurance claims have been refused, often due to pre-existing conditions. Many international [cruises](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/cruises) stopover in New Caledonia. To reduce your risks if you plan to travel on a cruise ship:

* check the onboard medical facilities are suitable
* understand the costs of onboard medical treatment
* buy travel insurance that covers your circumstances

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check with relevant authorities if it's legal in New Caledonia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* Your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in New Caledonia is generally high, however medical services have been impacted by staff shortages, and you may experience delays. Search and rescue facilities are limited. The difficult terrain limits quick access.

During a crisis, some medical facilities may be closed. Access may also be difficult or restricted, including opening hours of emergency wards. Check the websites and Facebook pages of these facilities for the most up-to-date information. If you require urgent medical care, call 15. Duty doctors will assess whether they will send a doctor or ambulance or advise alternative medical care for you. You may be taken to the hospital or advised how to make your way to the nearest medical centre or hospital.

Mobile phone coverage may be limited in some parts of the main island. Mobile network coverage is available on the [New Caledonian Postal and Telecommunications Directorate](https://www.opt.nc/particuliers/mobile/l-etendue-de-la-couverture-du-reseau-mobile)(OPTNC).

In the Southern Province:

* [Centre Hospitalier Territorial (CHT) Gaston Bourret](https://www.cht.nc/) (in French) is the main public facility at the Koutio Medipole in Dumbea, and their emergency ward is open 24/7.
* [Clinique Kuindo-Magnin](https://www.cliniques.nc/) (in French) is the main private facility in the suburb of Nouville in Noumea, and their emergency ward is open daily from 7am to 11pm.

In the Northern Province, the main public hospitals are:

* [Koumac (Hôpital Paula-Thavoavianon)](https://gouv.nc/etablissement-public/centre-hospitalier-du-nord-0) – has emergency, general medical and mid-wife services.
* [Poindimié (Hôpital Raymond Doui-Nebayes)](https://gouv.nc/etablissement-public/centre-hospitalier-du-nord-0) – has general, physical and rehabilitation, continuing care services.
* [Koné (Pôle Sanitaire du Nord)](https://gouv.nc/etablissement-public/centre-hospitalier-du-nord-0) – has emergency, general medical, surgery, anaesthesia, maternity, operations, day-care and continuing care services.

The only decompression chamber is in Noumea ([SCADEM - Travaux sous-marin Nouvelle-Calédonie](https://scadem.com/#caisson-hyperbare) (in French)).

Many popular dive sites are on other islands. If there's an accident, it may take several hours to reach medical facilities.

Medical costs can be high. Make sure your insurance covers medical evacuation and your planned activities.
