# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

New Caledonia is an overseas territory of France. A mix of French and local laws apply.

#### Local customs

Outside of tourist areas, dress and behaviour standards are conservative. Take care not to offend.

Visits to certain areas, including popular fishing and maritime areas, may require prior authorisation from the relevant customary authorities.  This is carried out through engaging in a 'coutume' (customary acknowledgement gesture).
