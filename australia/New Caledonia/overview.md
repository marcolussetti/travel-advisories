* Security incidents, including arson, continue across the country. Political demonstrations and protests may turn violent at short notice. Some essential services, including healthcare, are affected.
* Car theft, vehicle break-ins and household break-and-enters occur. Look after your belongings and always lock your car and accommodation.
* Cyclone season is from November to May, but cyclones and severe weather can occur at any time. They can cause landslides and flooding and may disrupt essential services. For more information read the [New Caledonia's cyclone alert system](https://securite-civile.gouv.nc/prevention-risques-majeurs/risques-naturels/cyclones) website (in French).

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases such as [Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [Chikungunya](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/chikungunya-virus-infection) and [Zika](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus) are risks in New Caledonia. ​Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof, and use insect repellent. If you're pregnant, discuss the risks of Zika virus with your doctor before you travel.
* Outbreaks of Leptospirosis are common, especially after heavy rain. Wear closed-in shoes. Avoid swimming in rivers or muddy water. Store food in enclosed containers and use a straw when drinking from cans.
* Other foodborne, waterborne, parasitic and infectious diseases occur. These include influenza, scabies and conjunctivitis. Get treatment if you have itchiness or skin lesions. In rural areas, drink boiled or bottled water. Tap water is generally safe to drink in towns.
* The standard of medical facilities in Noumea is high, but in outlying areas it can be basic. Civil unrest has disrupted medical services due to a decrease in available staff. You may experience challenges in accessing medical care, including longer wait times. Medical treatment can be expensive. Search and rescue facilities are limited. Some parts of New Caledonia don't have mobile phone coverage. Ensure your travel insurance covers all your medical conditions and medical evacuation.
