## Overview

### Safety

* Crime in Tonga is at the same level as expected in Australia and includes robbery, assault, theft and break-ins. Keep doors, windows and gates locked and don't go out alone at night.
* Civil unrest is rare, but protests could turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Communications in the outer islands, including the Vava'u and Ha'apai groups, can be limited at times, particularly after earthquakes.
* Tongan beaches can have strong rips and submerged debris from recent disasters that can make swimming dangerous. Ask locals about safe swimming areas.
* Between November and April, Tonga is prone to cyclones, but severe storms and flash flooding can happen year-round. Ensure you know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plan and locations of shelters in the event of a storm or cyclone.
* Tonga also experiences earthquakes which can cause tsunamis if severe enough. Ask your host or hotel about what to do if there's an earthquake. Know the warning signs for tsunamis and immediately move to designated tsunami evacuation sites. Don't wait for official alerts.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases include dengue and chikungunya. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof and use insect repellent when outdoors. Tonga has had outbreaks of Zika virus. If you're pregnant, discuss this with your doctor.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases include tuberculosis, typhoid and filariasis. Only drink boiled or bottled water and avoid raw or undercooked food. Eating reef fish and shellfish can lead to poisoning from naturally occurring toxins. Get urgent medical help if you suspect poisoning.
* Hospital and medical facilities are limited. You may need medical evacuation to Australia or New Zealand for even minor issues. Ensure your travel insurance covers this. Medical evacuation can be expensive and hard to organise.
