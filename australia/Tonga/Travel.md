#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [High Commission of Tonga](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/201) for details about visas, currency and customs rules.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over. If you arrive in Tonga with less than 6 months remaining on your passport you may end up stranded, receive an on the spot fine and have your passport taken until the fine is paid.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

If you want to stay longer or work, you'll need to apply for a visa.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Tongan Pa'anga (TOP).

Change Australian dollars for TOP at local banks. These include ANZ and Bank South Pacific.

Remote island groups have limited banking services.

The main island of Tongatapu has ATMs, but they don't accept all Australian cards. Ask your bank if your card will work in Tonga.

Credit card fraud and card skimming occurs. Don't expose your PIN when using ATMs. Check your bank statements often.

#### Driving permit

You can drive on your Australian driver’s licence for up to 12 months after arriving in Tonga. After that, you'll need to get a local licence. To get a licence, contact the Ministry of Infrastructure.

#### Road travel

Driving in Tonga can be dangerous, especially at night due to:

* poor street lighting
* low-quality roads
* pedestrians and free-roaming animals on roads

Speeding, alcohol and drug-driving cause many road deaths.

Some road rules differ from those in Australia. Be aware that:

* if you are turning left, you must give way to vehicles that are turning right
* the speed limit in most locations is 50km/h
* the blood alcohol limit for driving is 0.015%
* if you're caught with alcohol on your breath when driving, you'll be taken for further testing
