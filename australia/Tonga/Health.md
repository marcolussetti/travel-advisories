#### Travel insurance

Tonga requires all non-Tongan passport holders to have comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance).

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Tonga. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne disease outbreaks occur in Tonga, especially during the wet season. Diseases include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/)
* [Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm)

Mosquitos that carry these diseases are active throughout the day and at night. Mosquito repellent is available at most convenience stores and pharmacies in Tonga.

The Australian Department of Health and Aged Care's bulletin explains how to [minimise the risk of Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm). There's no vaccination for it.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* defer non-essential travel to affected areas

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you develop a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* only drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food

Get medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Fish poisoning

Eating reef fish can result in [ciguatera poisoning](https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/consumer/food-poisoning/fish-ciguatera-poisoning). Ciguatera is a naturally occurring seafood toxin.

Other risks include:

* [scombroid (histamine fish poisoning)](https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/consumer/food-poisoning/fish-histamine-poisoning)
* toxins in shellfish

Get urgent medical help if you suspect poisoning.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Hospital and medical facilities are limited, especially in remote island groups.

If you become ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to Australia or New Zealand, even for minor medical issues. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Evacuations on a Sunday are difficult to arrange because the airports don't operate.

There are no decompression chambers in Tonga. People with serious cases of decompression sickness are evacuated to the nearest treatment centre in New Zealand.

Registered dive companies carry basic treatment equipment to meet Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) standards.
