# Safety

#### Crime

Tonga has similar rates of violent crime to Australia. Petty crime is common. Crime that might affect security could increase at night.

Crimes may include:

* robbery
* assault
* sexual assault
* theft
* break-ins.

Thieves target electronic equipment such as tablets, mobile phones and other portable electronic devices.

To protect yourself from violent crime always lock doors, windows, gates and vehicles. Don't go out alone at night and try to avoid visiting isolated locations alone, including beaches.

You should remain security aware and be vigilant of your surroundings at all times.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare in Tonga, but any public protest or event that draws a large group of people can turn violent.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and other large public gatherings
* monitor local media for possible unrest
* don't visit affected areas

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

#### Adventure activities

#### Swimming safety

Take care when swimming at beaches, especially those with outlying coral reefs. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic eruption and tsunami has led to debris in the sand and water. This includes glass, wood, tiles and more. Take extra care when swimming.

Strong rips can occur where there's a break in the reef. This makes it dangerous for swimmers and surfers. People have drowned.

Ask locals about danger spots before swimming.

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This applies to:

* dive companies
* adventure tour companies
* fishing charters
* offshore surfing charters

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* don't travel on an overloaded vessel
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Volcanos

Tonga has numerous volcanoes, and explosive eruptions can happen at any time. 

Home Reef Volcano began erupting on 3 July. The volcano activity poses low risk to residents of Vava’u and Ha’apai Island groups. Mariners are advised to stay at least 5kms from the volcano.

Parts of Tonga are severely impacted by and recovering from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and tsunami which flooded parts of Tongatapu and other nearby islands in January 2022. 

Volcanoes and earthquakes can cause damage to communications in the outer islands at short notice, including the Vava'u and Ha'apai groups. 

Monitor media for the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities. See the [Government of Tonga website](https://www.gov.to/) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TongaGovPortal) and monitor local media.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can happen in Tonga. Being close to the Tonga Trench, a destructive tsunami can arrive within 20 minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake.

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the:

* [International Tsunami Information Center](http://itic.ioc-unesco.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1142&Itemid=1437&lang=en)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Co-ordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/)

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away. Do this if local authorities advise so, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens.

Once on high ground, monitor local media and the [Tonga Meteorological Service](https://met.gov.to/).

#### Earthquakes

Tonga experiences earthquakes.

Get to know the earthquake safety measures for each place you stay and visit. Ask your hotel or host for advice.

If there's an earthquake:

* consider tsunami risks
* expect aftershocks and travel delays
* reconfirm travel plans with agents and tour operators

#### Severe weather

Tonga can experience [natural disasters](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident), such as [cyclones](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters), [earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) and [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis).

During an emergency, the [Tongan National Emergency Management Office](http://tonganemo.wordpress.com/contact-us/) provides updates on Radio 1 at frequency 1017AM.

If a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

If you're due to arrive after a natural disaster or during cyclone season, ask your tour operator or airline if it affects your travel plans.

**More information:**

#### Tropical storms and cyclones

The cyclone season is November to April. However, tropical storms and cyclones can happen throughout the year. This weather can bring on flooding, gale-force winds and disruptions to services.

The direction and strength of cyclones can change suddenly. If there's a cyclone or tropical storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* port access may be affected
* there may not be enough shelter available

If a cyclone or tropical storm is approaching:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* identify your local shelter
