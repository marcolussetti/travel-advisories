# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Sunday activities

Sabbath laws strictly limit Sunday activities including public exercise, swimming, playing sport, listening to loud music and fishing. Most businesses are closed except for some resorts and restaurants.

#### Driving laws

The blood alcohol limit for driving in Tonga is 0.015%.

There are 2 breath tests for blood alcohol readings. The first is a roadside test to see if you have alcohol in your system.

If you test positive for alcohol, you'll be taken to a police station for a second test. If your reading is between 0.025% and 0.04%, police will give you an on-the-spot fine. If your reading is above 0.04%, police will charge you and you'll have to appear in court.

If police catch you outside business hours, they'll likely hold you in a police cell until they can charge you.

#### Other laws

Sodomy is a criminal offence. Punishment is a maximum of 10 years in jail.

#### Local customs

Tonga is a highly religious country (predominantly Christian) as well as an overall conservative country. Take care not to offend. This includes showing respect for the Royal Family. 

Dress modestly and avoid public affection to avoid unwanted attention. For example, women can wear bikinis at a resort and males can swim shirtless, but more modest swimwear is recommended at public beaches. Topless bathing is not accepted.
