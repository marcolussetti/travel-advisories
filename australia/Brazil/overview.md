## Overview

### Safety

* Violent crime, including mugging, armed robbery and carjacking is common. These occur more often in large cities and during festivals, such as Carnival. Don't go out alone at night. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches. Crime rates are particularly high in shanty towns or 'favelas'. Don't enter favelas, even with a tour group.
* Large scale protests can occur at any time in Brazil. Monitor the media and follow the instructions of local authorities. Review our guidance on [staying safe when there are demonstrations](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest").
* Use only prepaid or official taxis. If using rideshare apps such as Uber, ensure you enter the vehicle with the same plate number and name shown in the app. If you're driving yourself, keep doors locked and windows closed. Ensure your route avoids favelas.
* The wet season is from November to July. However, heavy rainfall can occur all year depending on the region. Landslides and flooding can occur, and severe storms often delay flights. Be prepared to change your travel plans.
