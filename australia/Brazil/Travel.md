#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

From 10 April you'll need a visa to enter Brazil. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For more information, contact an [embassy or consulate of Brazil.](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/30/State)

If you plan to live in Brazil, you'll need to get a visa before arrival. The Brazilian Government strongly enforces immigration and entry laws.

If you need a visa and arrive without one, authorities will send you back on the next available flight.

Entry and exit conditions may change at short notice.

#### Other formalities

#### Entry and exit stamps

When you arrive, authorities will stamp your passport. This may be inspected by immigration authorities when you leave.

If you plan to leave Brazil and return during your trip, ensure you get entry and exit stamps in your passport from Brazilian immigration authorities, especially when crossing land borders.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Brazil. Some airlines may want to see a copy when you depart to Australia or other countries.

#### Travel with children

Dual-national children must enter and exit Brazil using their Brazilian passports.

Brazilian and dual-national children travelling in the company of only one parent must provide proof of consent to travel from the non-accompanying parent. If you can't produce proof of parental consent, local authorities will stop your children from departing Brazil. Unaccompanied children, or children travelling in the company of a non-parent, will require the consent of both parents.

Parental consent will usually be in the form of an observation note inserted into the child's Brazilian passport when it is issued by the Brazilian authorities. Alternatively, a Brazilian Embassy, Consulate or Juvenile Court can witness and notarise written parental consent or proof of residence outside Brazil.

If one or both parents are deceased, you'll require a death certificate notarised by a Brazilian Embassy, Consulate or Juvenile Court.

Parents of dual-national children should contact a Brazilian embassy or consulate for advice.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Authorities won't let you enter Brazil unless your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the date of your entry. This may apply even if you're just transiting.

Some immigration authorities and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Tourists can receive conflicting advice from different sources. You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/44).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the [nearest embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Brazilian Real (BRL).

Declare amounts over USD 10,000 (or foreign currency equivalent) when you arrive and depart. This includes all forms of currency, not just cash.  
US dollars are the easiest to exchange. Credit cards are widely accepted.

Ask your bank in Australia if your ATM card will work and if it has an affiliate bank in Brazil, as some local machines may be unreliable. To combat fraud and theft, many ATMs may limit the amount you can withdraw per day. 

Credit card fraud is widespread. Take care when making online payments. Check your bank statements for unauthorised charges.

#### Local travel

#### Remote areas

You're at risk of becoming lost or injured while trekking in remote parts of Brazil. This includes the Amazon border regions and the Pantanal wetlands.

Use an experienced guide.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Brazil for up to 180 days after your arrival, as long as you carry a valid Australian driver’s licence. It is also recommended that you carry a translation of your licence. After this period, you will need to obtain a local driver’s licence.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Brazil than in Australia.

Hazards on the road include:

* aggressive driving
* poorly maintained roads
* large numbers of trucks and other slow vehicles on main routes

Traffic lights are often not obeyed, especially at night in larger cities. Don't assume cars will stop.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have enough insurance
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* don't drink and drive – penalties are severe for driving with a blood-alcohol reading over 0%
* guard against carjacking and other vehicle-related crimes by staying alert: keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight; don’t stay in a parked vehicle and check your route beforehand (make sure it isn’t via a favela)

If you're in an accident:

* call 193 for the fire department if there are injuries
* call 190 for the police if there are no injuries

#### Motorcycles

Check if your insurance policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Registered taxis, rideshares such as Uber and the metro are generally safe. To reduce your risk:

* only use licensed taxis or rideshare booked through apps
* find out what transport services are available at the airport before you travel; most airports have licenced taxi desks inside the baggage reclaim areas and allow payment before travel
* always ask if the driver will use the meter, or agree on the fare before you get in a taxi
* ensure you enter the vehicle with the same plate number and name as shown in the app, and don't get into a taxi or rideshare if other passengers are already inside.
* avoid using motorcycle taxis

#### Public transport

Brazil has a well-developed network of inter-city buses, as well as metro systems in some of the major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Travel can be risky due to poor vehicle maintenance, local driving habits and petty crime.

Be alert when using public transport, especially during busy times and at night.

Criminals often work in gangs robbing people gathered in the same place. Public transport hubs can be hotspots.

#### Boat travel

International cruise liners visit Brazil.

Commercial riverboats are common in some parts. Keep your belongings close.

Tourist operators often use basic vessels for river outings in jungle areas.

You should always wear a life jacket. Boat accidents can occur.

Piracy happens, particularly in the north-east. Armed groups, including pirates and drug traffickers, travel rivers in the Amazonas state, where there is a low presence of police and local authorities. Cruise ships and lodges have been attacked.

The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) issues [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/imb-piracy-reporting-centre-2/) on its website.

#### Air travel

Domestic and international flight delays are common. Airport strikes also occur.

Ask your travel agent if your itinerary allows for delays.

Be prepared for the possibility of extended waits at airports.

If you need to make or change airline bookings while in Brazil, ensure your payment method will be accepted.

Most major airlines, such as LATAM, Gol and Azul, accept international credit cards, although some may only accept them on their international websites.

Travel and tour agents may also have restrictions. You may need to pay cash at the airline office or ask your Australian travel provider.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Brazil's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PP) with the Aviation Safety Network.
