#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Brazil. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases are a serious risk in Brazil. [Yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever), [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [malaria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/malaria) and the [zika virus](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/zika-virus) are common. Other insect-borne diseases include:

* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

You're most at risk during the wet season, in poorer urban areas or in regional areas where there are stagnant bodies of water, including the Pantanal or Amazon.

Take the following steps to avoid insect bites:

* cover exposed skin with light-coloured long-sleeved shirts and long pants
* use insect repellents. If you use both sunscreen and insect repellent, apply the sunscreen first and then the repellent
* treat your clothing and gear with insecticides
* sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms. Use bed nets if you can't keep mosquitoes from coming inside the room
* consider taking anti-malarial medication

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk. Take precautions if you're taking part in activities that put you at risk of infection, such as avoiding contact with contaminated objects and sharing personal items. Practice safe sex.

#### Other health risks

There are recurrent [measles](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/measles/en/) outbreaks in Brazil. To protect yourself, stay up to date with your vaccinations, wash your hands regularly and avoid close contact with people who are sick and wild or domestic animals.

Food-related, waterborne and other infectious diseases are common, including:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals
* avoid swimming in fresh water

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

Make sure your vaccinations are up to date.

#### Medical care

You can access free health care at public hospitals and clinics in Brazil. The standard of emergency care is generally high but can vary, with access being more limited and of a lower standard outside of major urban areas.

When accessing public health care, you will likely experience overcrowding, longer wait times and more rudimentary facilities than you are accustomed to in Australia. It is very unlikely your treating doctor will speak English.

Private health care at hospitals and clinics in larger cities is often similar or superior to Australia. Doctors will often speak at least some English. Private medical care is very expensive, even more expensive if you need a medical evacuation. You may be charged upfront or be required to produce proof of insurance prior to receiving treatment.

Public mental health care facilities are basic and overcrowded with a focus on more severe chronic and acute care, using a pharmaceutical-based treatment approach.
