#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, often involving weapons, is common, especially in large cities. Most crime is opportunistic. Common examples which involve tourists include the theft of valuables at the beach or from bags and valuables snatched while sightseeing. Tourists have also been robbed at knife or gunpoint. Local authorities advise against taking valuables and passports to the beach. Carry a photocopy of your passport or another form of identity.

Muggings and other violent crimes are common in and around:

* tourist spots, hotels, nightclubs and bars
* historical centres
* public transport
* car parks
* public beaches
* outdoor markets
* unregistered taxis
* ATMs and currency exchange facilities

Other common crimes include:

* carjacking
* food and drink spiking
* [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") and scams

In Rio de Janeiro, crime hotspots include:

* Copacabana Beach
* Ipanema Beach
* the Pedra do Sal area
* the Santa Teresa area
* the Lapa neighbourhood
* the Christ the Redeemer statue
* the Corcovado Trail

In São Paulo, crime hotspots are in the downtown area and around the historical centre of the city and include:

* around the São Paulo Cathedral
* Pinacoteca
* Station of light (Estação da Luz)
* Princess Isabel Square
* Central market

In Brasilia, crime hotspots include the central bus station and two adjacent shopping centres.

Crime levels in shanty towns, or 'favelas', and many satellite cities are especially high.

Crimes relating to drug trafficking and illicit goods are common along Brazil's western and northern border areas, posing a risk of violent crime to travellers. Affected areas include:

* the states of Amazonas, Acre, Rondônia, Mato Grosso, Roraima, Pará and Amapá
* river travel in the Amazon, particularly Itaquai, Japura and Rio Negro rivers and tributaries.
* the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil (Foz do Iguaçu city) and Paraguay

Your safety is your main priority. Don't chase after a perpetrator or resist. Criminals may be armed and, if challenged, they may respond with violence. They will often have accomplices nearby. If you're robbed, report it to the local police.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid crime hotspots, especially late at night
* stay alert in public places, especially where there are lots of people, including other tourists
* leave valuables and passport in a hotel safe
* keep mobile devices and other valuables out of sight
* keep your belongings and baggage close to you when you're outside
* lock the doors and windows of your accommodation, including balcony doors
* avoid going out alone, especially at night
* avoid isolated areas on the beach
* don't leave your luggage, food or drinks unattended
* never accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from people you've just met
* don't enter favelas, even with a tour group

If you're a victim of violent crime, including rape, seek immediate medical help. The risk of HIV/AIDS is high.

Female survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault can access a dedicated hotline that provides access to local support services, including police, by calling 180 or via the WhatsApp phone messaging application on +55 61 99610 0180.

#### Partying safely

Crime levels increase before and during festivals such as Carnival, with tourists being targeted.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

Make sure you follow these tips:

* watch out for drink spiking and know your alcohol limits
* don’t use drugs – penalties for drug offences in Brazil are high
* don’t drink and drive – penalties are severe for driving with a blood-alcohol reading over 0%
* keep your valuables out of sight, as petty crime, such as bag or phone snatching, is common
* be mindful of where you’re going, get recommendations from your hotel and plan your transport options in advance

#### Scams

Scammers take advantage of people looking for romantic partners, often via dating websites, apps or social media, by pretending to be prospective companions. Be wary of any online invitation you receive to travel to an unfamiliar location, especially if the location is changed at late notice and if someone is offering romance. The scammer may kidnap you and force you to transfer or withdraw money and then extort your loved ones for more money to secure your release.

Take caution when purchasing food and beverages from vendors, especially at the beach when paying by card. Confirm the price before and check the figure on the card machine is correct and hasn't been inflated. Don’t give your card to the vendor when making payments.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnappings can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnappings occur in Brazil. Foreigners have been kidnapped in the past. Kidnappings are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. Scammers may kidnap you to seek a ransom for your release.

Express kidnappings happen in Brazil; anyone can be targeted. Criminals may kidnap or threaten you to force you to withdraw large amounts of money from ATMs or banking applications on your phones.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* don’t display money or valuables in public
* use ATMs inside banks, hotels and shopping centres and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Large-scale protests are common. Public protests and events that draw large crowds can turn violent and authorities have used tear gas and other riot-control measures.

Demonstrations and protests often interrupt traffic and public transport.

During periods of unrest:

* avoid protests and rallies
* monitor the news for possible unrest and avoid those areas
* if a protest occurs, leave if it's safe to do so
* prepare for long waits and be ready to adjust your travel plans
* follow instructions from the local authorities

You should follow the instructions of local authorities and review our guidance on [staying safe when there are demonstrations](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest").

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Swimming safety

Many beaches, including in Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza, have strong, dangerous rips.

Shark attacks are possible, especially at many north-eastern beaches. Obey warning signs.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Brazil experiences severe droughts and flooding.

If there's a [natural disaster](/node/346):

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact with your friends and family
* monitor the media and local sources
* follow the advice of local authorities

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Wet season

The wet season is from January to July in the north, November to March in the south and south-east and April to July in the north-east. Landslides, flooding and flash flooding can happen, especially in poorer urban areas. 

It's common for flooding and severe storms to damage transport infrastructure, including roads and bridges and can delay domestic and international flights. Monitor local media for weather advice and follow any instructions given by local authorities.

#### Staying safe in the heat

If you're travelling during extreme hot weather, plan your days to avoid being outside during the hottest part of the day. If you go out in the heat, rest often and stay in the shade as much as possible.

* Drink plenty of water. Even if you're not thirsty. Avoid alcohol
* Wear sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses
* Wear loose, lightweight, light-coloured clothing

Avoid strenuous outdoor activities such as hiking or biking in extreme hot weather, particularly if you're not usually active or used to high temperatures.

Wildfires are common from May to September, especially during July and August due to the arrival of the dry season. Heavy smoke may degrade the air quality in areas near active fires. In case of a major fire, stay away from the affected areas, monitor local media and follow instructions of local authorities.
