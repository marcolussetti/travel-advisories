# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't intervene in another country's court proceedings or get you out of jail.

#### Drug laws

Penalties for drug offences are strict.

A mandatory sentence of 25 years applies for possessing illegal 'hard drugs'. Hard drugs include heroin, cocaine and synthetics.
