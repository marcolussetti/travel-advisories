# Safety

#### Crime

The crime rate is low.

Petty crime from drug use is increasing.

To protect yourself from theft:

* be aware of your personal safety
* protect your valuables
* don't buy or accept counterfeit goods

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if it is covered by your travel insurance policy
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Diving, swimming and caving

There is unexploded ordnance in Palau left from World War II, particularly in Peleliu and Angaur.

Be careful when diving or exploring caves.

Saltwater crocodiles live in parts of Palau. You may not be able to see them. Ask local authorities before entering the water where there are mangroves.

If you plan to visit the Jellyfish Lake on Eil Malk Island, you're only permitted to snorkel, you're not permitted to scuba dive.

Beaches are not usually patrolled in Palau. Maritime search and rescue is limited. Swimmers have died because of heatstroke, strong tides and powerful lagoon currents. Be alert to warning signs and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Palau can experience [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") and tropical storms.

If a tropical storm is approaching:

* closely monitor the media
* keep in contact with friends and family.

If there's a tropical storm:

* it might disrupt services
* adequate shelter may not be available
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* it could affect access to seaports.

To stay safe during severe weather:

* be familiar with the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* find out where your local shelter is
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local weather reports
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea.

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, check local media.
