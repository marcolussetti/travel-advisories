#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy must cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Iceland. Check if any rules or restrictions apply. Depending on your medication, you may need to apply for a permit to bring it into Iceland. Always bring a copy of your prescription and transport your medication in its original container. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Ask an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/90)or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/90/State) of Iceland about any restrictions on amounts that may apply.

Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Health risks are broadly similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

The standard of health facilities and care is high. Many people speak English. However, services can be limited in areas with fewer people.

Australia doesn't have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Iceland.

Healthcare costs are the same as, or more expensive than, private treatment in Australia. Upfront payment may be required.

Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.
