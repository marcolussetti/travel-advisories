Latest update

There are volcanic eruptions occurring on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Southwest Iceland, near the town of Grindavík and the Blue Lagoon. Avoid areas near the eruption site and areas close to mountains with steep slopes on the Reykjanes peninsula due to the danger of falling rocks. Further eruptions could happen at any time and without warning. Southern Iceland could be affected by potentially dangerous volcanic gas clouds, including Þorlákshöfn and Vestmannaeyjar. If you're in an area affected by volcanic gas, monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities (see 'Safety'). The international airport remains open.

## Overview

### Safety

* A series of volcanic eruptions have occurred on the Reykjanes Peninsula north of Grindavík. Strong earthquakes could happen before and after an eruption, leading to further volcanic eruptions without warning. Due to the danger of falling rocks, avoid areas near eruption sites and areas close to mountains with steep slopes. The area is also in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone. Tsunamis are a threat in coastal areas. Monitor the local media for reports on volcanic and seismic activity and follow the [advice of local authorities](https://safetravel.is/).
* Clouds of volcanic gas could move across southern Iceland, which could bring dangerous gasses to areas including Þorlákshöfn and Vestmannaeyjar. If you're in areas affected by volcanic gas, monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Iceland's climate is unpredictable. Iceland experiences snow, sand and ash storms. Check local sources for weather and updates about road closures and other disruptions.
* Some places in the Arctic are a long way from mobile phone coverage and help in an emergency. If you need help, you may have to wait a long time. Only book travel with companies that have onboard medical help.
* Petty theft can happen. Gang-related activity can also occur. Pay close attention to your belongings and surroundings.
