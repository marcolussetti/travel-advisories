# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you break the law in Iceland, you may be banned from the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") for a limited time (up to 10 years) or permanently.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, even for possession of small amounts of recreational drugs or some prescription medications, include:

* heavy fines
* imprisonment
* being removed from the Schengen area
* a potential entry ban

If you intend to take medication, confirm it's legal in your destination. Check if any rules or restrictions apply. Depending on your medication, you may need to apply for a permit to bring it to your destination. Always carry a copy of your prescription and transport your medication in its original container.
