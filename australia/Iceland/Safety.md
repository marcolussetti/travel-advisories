# Safety

#### Crime

Iceland has a low crime rate. However, you could face petty theft. This often occurs around bars late at night in downtown Reykjavik.

There have been rare instances of gang-related violent crime.

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour
* pay attention to your surroundings.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare, and protests are mostly peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. If there's civil unrest, avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.

* monitor the media for news of protests
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other locations frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Europe.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Be careful when engaging in adventure activities in Iceland, including mountaineering, trekking, skiing and glacier climbing.

The weather conditions, rough terrain, and volcanic activity in Iceland can lead to safety concerns if you don't adequately prepare for your trip.

Trails and natural hazards aren't always well-marked or signed. Certain routes cross glaciers that are dangerous to navigate without proper equipment and training. Volcanic and geologically active areas pose a risk to hikers and trekkers. Hazards can be hidden within the landscape.

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it. Buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts. If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* register your itinerary and contact details with the Icelandic authorities and book accommodations, or camp, in authorised campsites
* carry a cell phone, emergency contact information, and bring an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) to remote areas

Icelandic authorities maintain a web portal to inform tourists of good practices and hazards. You can register your itinerary and receive safety alerts through SMS. Icelandic emergency services also offer a location-based emergency assistance app called 112 Iceland App.

#### Trekking

If you want to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure") or go trekking:

* get local advice on routes and the weather before setting out
* use an experienced and well-known trekking company
* always let someone know where you're going and when you expect to return
* don't trek alone or off marked trails
* keep a safe distance from seals
* follow the advice of rangers in wilderness areas.

#### Swimming safety

Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides, large waves, and strong ocean currents can catch even experienced swimmers off guard. Large surges of water or “sneaker waves” have killed people at the Reynisfjara and Kikjufjara black sand beaches in southern Iceland. 

Inland waters may also be dangerous. Many of Iceland’s rivers have swift currents and waterfalls. Hot springs can be dangerously hot.

* Always check downstream before you swim in a river
* Always check the water before going into a natural hot spring

#### Climate and natural disasters

Iceland experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") such as:

* glacial floods
* volcanic eruptions
* earthquakes and landslides

If there's a natural disaster:

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* contact friends and family with regular updates about your welfare
* monitor the media, other local information and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis

Iceland has active [volcanoes](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/volcanic-eruption "A volcano has erupted"). Monitor the local media for reports on volcanic and seismic activity and follow the [advice of local authorities](https://safetravel.is/).

Volcanic and seismic activity has increased around Mt. Thorbjörn, 40km southwest of Reykjavik, and near the Blue Lagoon and Keflavik International Airport.  

Clouds of volcanic gas could move across southern Iceland, bringing potentially dangerous levels to areas including Þorlákshöfn and Vestmannaeyjar. If you're in an area affected by volcanic gas:

* monitor the local air quality, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments
* keep your windows closed and turn off ventilation systems
* avoid low-lying ground and valleys

If you're in Iceland:

* stay away from areas near the eruption sites, particularly if you suffer from respiratory ailments due to the risk of harmful gases
* avoid areas close to mountains and steep slopes on the Reykjanes peninsuladue to the danger of falling rocks
* monitor local media to stay informed and
* follow the advice of local authorities.

Volcanic eruptions have disrupted flights. Check with your airline for any flight changes due to ash releases.

The [Icelandic Meteorological Office](http://en.vedur.is/) continues to monitor the situation.

Iceland is in an active [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/345) zone.

[Tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/346) are a threat in coastal areas.

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away if advised, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.

#### Travel in the Arctic

Some places in the Arctic are a long way from help, including:

* search and rescue
* evacuation
* medical facilities

Search and rescue teams in the region are highly skilled. However, help depends on the weather and sea conditions in an emergency. If you need help, you may have to wait a long time.

Before booking travel in the region, check your travel company's:

* experience
* reputation
* standard of onboard medical help
