#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Iceland is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). You may be able to enter Iceland without a visa in some cases. Get an entry stamp in your passport from border control when you first enter the Schengen area.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/90) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/90/State) of Iceland, or the [Directorate of Immigration](https://island.is/en/o/directorate-of-immigration), for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/90) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/90/State) of Iceland for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

[Passports of non-EEA nationals](https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/travel-document-requirements), including Australians, must have been issued in the last ten years and be valid for at least 3 months from the date of departure from Iceland.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Always carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen area.](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Iceland's currency is the Icelandic Kroner (ISK). 

Declare cash of over 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Iceland and any non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll have to pay a fine on entry or exit if you: 

* don't declare your money
* give incorrect information

You can use major credit cards in most places.

#### Local travel

#### Volcanic activity

A volcanic eruption has occurred on the Reykjanes Peninsula north of Grindavík (see [Safety](#safety)). The international airport remains open.

#### Natural attractions

Hazards at natural attractions rarely have warning signs or safety barriers. Stay on marked paths and use common sense. Certain routes cross glaciers that are dangerous to navigate without proper equipment and training. Volcanic and geologically active areas pose a risk to hikers and trekkers. Hazards can be hidden within the landscape.

If you visit geysers, take care. The hot steam and water can cause injuries. Take extra care on windy days.

#### Road travel

Driving conditions can be hazardous. Check guidance from the [Icelandic Transport Authority](https://www.icetra.is/road-traffic/how-to-drive-in-iceland/) before driving.

Roads are narrow and can be impassable in winter when there's less daylight. Speed limits are low. Most urban roads, as well as Iceland’s national Route 1, the “ring road,” are paved. Many inland roads are unpaved, narrow and lack shoulders.

Most bridges outside of Reykjavik are one-lane. Slow down when approaching bridges to ensure there is no traffic approaching from the other side. If cars are approaching from both sides, the closest car to the bridge has the right of way.

Driving can be hazardous, particularly in winter. Wildlife road accidents can occur. Be particularly vigilant if driving at nighttime.

The weather and river levels can change quickly. Plan ahead.

The northern lights can distract drivers, making them lose control or stop without warning, creating a hazard for other road users.

If you want to drive, be aware that authorities:

* impose heavy fines for speeding
* strictly enforce drink driving laws with severe penalties
* strictly control off-road driving

Always keep your headlights on (low beam during the day).

You need winter tyres from around November to April. The dates may vary each year. 

#### Driving permit

Australian driving licences are valid in Iceland if you have had your licence for a minimum of 1 year. However, some car rental companies require customers to present an International Driving Permit (IDP) if holding a licence issued outside Europe or North America. Digital driver's licences may not be accepted.

If you need an IDP, get this before you leave Australia. An IDP doesn't replace the requirement for a regular driver's license.

If your driving licence is not written in Latin letters or doesn't include your licence number, a photograph or an issuing date, you'll also need an IDP to drive in Iceland.

#### Highland driving

Many highland tracks are only open for a short part of the summer.

If you plan to drive to the highlands or other remote regions, check with the [Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration](http://www.road.is/).

Call (+354) 522 1100 for updates on:

* road hazards
* weather conditions
* off-road driving conditions

If you plan to drive in a remote area, including the highlands:

* check road conditions
* use a four-wheel-drive vehicle
* share your travel itinerary with a third-party
* bring a cell phone and sufficient supplies of fuel, water and food
