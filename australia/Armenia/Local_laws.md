# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in Armenia cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long prison sentences.

#### Other laws

Always carry a copy of your passport. Police can stop you to check your documents.

It's illegal to take photos of:

* government or military sites
* monuments
* officers in uniform

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Armenia recognises dual nationality.

Ask the [Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.am/en/citizenship/) about citizenship laws.

You must enter and exit the country using your Armenian passport if you're a dual national. This limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

You could be subject to military service in Armenia if you're a male dual citizen aged 18 to 28. Check with the nearest [embassy or consulate of Armenia](https://www.mfa.am/en/consulates/) well before you travel.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships are legal, but aren't widely accepted.

Discrimination against the LGBQTIA+ community is widespread. Avoid public displays of affection.
