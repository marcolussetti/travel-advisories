#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Protests and demonstrations can occur in Yerevan, Gyumri and other major cities. They're generally peaceful but can escalate.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid the affected areas
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Conflict zones

Due to the risk of armed conflict, [do not travel](/consular-services/travel-advice-explained "Travel advice explained")to within 5kms of Armenia's border with Azerbaijan.

The border areas between Armenia and Azerbaijan contain mines and unexploded ordnance. The police or the military will likely stop anyone venturing within 5km of these borders. Some parts of the Armenia and Azerbaijan border haven't been agreed between the states.

Cars and other vehicles on the roads from Kayan and Ijevan to Noyemberyan could be attacked.

#### Terrorism

Terrorists have staged attacks in European cities, targeting public transport and places popular with foreigners.

Take official warnings seriously.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats in public places
* take care near areas known to be possible terrorist targets
* report suspicious behaviour
* alert police to unattended bags
* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and theft from cars, is common. Be careful on trains to and from Georgia.

Travellers have reported harassment, mistreatment and extortion by police or other local officials.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* look after your belongings, particularly in crowded places
* always lock your car doors
* park your car in a secure facility if possible
* monitor local media for crime news

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
