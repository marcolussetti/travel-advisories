#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You don't need a visa for Armenia if you're staying for up to 180 days per year.

If you're staying longer than 180 days per year, you must register with the police.

Visa and other entry and exit conditions, such as currency, customs and quarantine regulations, can change at short notice. To get the latest details, contact either:

* the nearest [embassy or consulate of Armenia](https://www.mfa.am/en/consulates/)
* the [Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.am/en/visa)

#### Import and export regulations

Strict rules apply to the import and export of:

* antiques
* firearms
* pornographic material
* communication equipment
* cash amounts of USD10,000 and over or equivalent in other currency

You need approval from the Armenian Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports to export antiques or other items that could have historical value, including paintings, old books and carpets.

Keep receipts for all items. You may need to show them to customs officials when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Armenian Dram (AMD).

Strict rules apply to importing and exporting cash amounts of USD 10,000 or over (or equivalent).

US dollars and euros can be exchanged at banks.

ATMs and credit card facilities are available in Yerevan but are less common outside major towns.

#### Local travel

Armenia's land borders with Azerbaijan and Turkiye are closed. Don't attempt to cross the border with Azerbaijan. Travelling in the region can be difficult. You'll need to plan ahead.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Armenia, you need both:

* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)
* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

#### Road travel

Driving in Armenia can be dangerous. Common dangers include:

* roads and vehicles in poor condition
* few road signs
* drivers who ignore traffic signals and rules
* drivers who don't give way to pedestrians
* pedestrians who cross roads without warning

Check if your travel insurance will cover you for driving.

Make sure you understand local road rules.

Roads and land crossing points can close at short notice. Get local advice on different routes.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and authorised limousines.

Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi for you. Don't hail taxis in the street. 

Sit in the back seat.

#### Air travel

In April 2022, the EU announced that 21 Russian-owned airlines were banned from flying in EU airspace due to safety concerns. 

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. You should research your aviation provider if you're flying domestically or internationally.

Check [Armenia's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EK) with the Aviation Safety Network.
