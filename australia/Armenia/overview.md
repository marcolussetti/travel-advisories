## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel within 5km of Armenia's border with Azerbaijan due to the risk of armed conflict, the volatile security environment on the border, and unmarked landmines. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Protests occur in Yerevan, Gyumri and other major cities. In the past, some of these protests have been violent. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and theft from cars, is common. Be careful on trains to and from Georgia.

### Health

* Some medications are illegal in Armenia, such as some sleeping tablets and medications containing codeine. Check your medication is legal before you travel.
* Common foodborne, waterborne, and other infectious diseases include typhoid, hepatitis and tuberculosis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Public hospital standards are basic, especially outside Yerevan. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties include long prison sentences.
* Always carry a copy of your passport. Show it to the police if asked.
* Be careful when taking photos. Photographing government or military sites, monuments or officers in uniform is illegal.
* Law enforcement agencies in Armenia cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in a CIS country, you may be detained in another and extradited for prosecution.

You may need to do military service if you're male and aged between 18 and 28. Check with your nearest [Armenian embassy or consulate](https://www.mfa.am/en/consulates/) before you travel.
* Same-sex relationships are legal but aren't widely accepted. Discrimination against LGBTI people is common. Avoid public displays of affection.
