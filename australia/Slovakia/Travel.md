#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Slovakia is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), which means that you can sometimes enter the country without a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/180) [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/180/State) of Slovakia for details about visas, currency, customs and other rules.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### Border measures

You may be subject to random border checks by authorities, including at Schengen borders, particularly at borders with Austria. 

Make sure you:

* check that the entry stamp in your passport is readable when you enter the [Schengen](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen) area for the first time. Border officials may ask you to show them an onward or return ticket.
* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen).

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports.

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements .

#### Passport

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, you must notify the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact your nearest [Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Slovakia's official currency is the Euro.

Declare more than 10,000 euros or equivalent funds if you're travelling between Slovakia and a non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not just cash. Failure to do so will result in fines.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

ATMs may be rare in mountain areas or small villages.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Slovakia for up to 90 days with both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence, and
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance. 

Get your IDP before departing Australia.

#### Road travel

Roads in Slovakia are generally safe.

Driving in poor weather, particularly on rural roads, may be dangerous.

When driving in Slovakia, you must:

* have winter tyres in snow or icy conditions
* keep your headlights on at all times (even during the daytime)
* carry a warning triangle and first aid kit in your vehicle

Check your rental car is fitted with the required equipment.

The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0%.

You must purchase an [electronic permit (vignette)](https://eznamka.sk/en) to drive on motorways. You can buy these online or at petrol stations, post offices and border stations.

#### Motorcycles

Check whether your travel insurance policy covers you when using a motorcycle, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only clearly marked taxis. Check that the meter is running at the beginning of your trip to avoid being overcharged. 

If using rideshare apps, make sure you enter the vehicle with the same plate number and name shown in the app.

#### Public transport

Slovakia has a well-developed and reliable public transportation system. This includes trains that run to all major towns. Take care of your personal belongings, particularly on trains and in major transport hubs. Don't leave bags unattended on trains, even briefly.

Make sure you consider border crossings and travel with your passport.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
