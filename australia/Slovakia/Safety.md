# Safety

#### Border with Ukraine

Do not travel from Slovakia to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. The security situation continues to be volatile. Take care while travelling in the regions bordering Ukraine.

#### Terrorism

Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts and sporting venues, including LGBTQIA+ events
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and events that draw large groups of people are generally peaceful but can turn violent.  

They can also disrupt traffic and public transport. 

To stay safe:

* avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime happens, especially around:

* railway stations
* public transport
* markets and bars
* other popular tourist spots, including Bratislava's Old Town area

Pickpockets often:

* work in teams
* include children
* use distraction techniques
* target foreigners

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on trains, buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour
* leave a situation if you think there may be danger
* monitor local media for new safety risks
* keep your passport separate from your other ID

#### Theft

Thefts and break-ins happen, including theft from cars.

Criminals sometimes slash tyres so they can offer to help. After distracting their victim, they then steal items.

To protect yourself from theft:

* pay attention to your belongings, especially on public transport and at tourist spots
* use secure parking if it's available
* on overnight trains, lock your door from the inside
* be wary of direct offers of help from strangers
* don't leave valuables in the car

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can occur at popular nightclubs, sometimes leading to [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Overcharging

Bars and restaurants sometimes overcharge travellers. Disputes about overcharging can lead to violence.

Always check the price of food and drinks before ordering. Be wary of invitations to restaurants and bars from strangers. 

#### Fake police officers

If you suspect someone is posing as a police officer, don't hand over your personal belongings. Offer to go to the nearest police station or call 112 to check their identity.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
