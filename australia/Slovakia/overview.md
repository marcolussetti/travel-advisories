## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel from Slovakia to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. The security situation continues to be volatile.
* Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, tourist areas, markets, shopping areas, transport hubs, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police. Petty crime, theft from vehicles and highway robberies can happen. Be careful on public transport, in tourist areas, petrol stations and highway parking areas. Use secure parking facilities.
* Bars and restaurants can overcharge travellers, and disputes about overcharging can lead to violence. Always check menu prices before ordering.
* Weather in mountain regions is unpredictable and can change suddenly. Don't ski outside prepared ski areas.

### Health

* Take care in forests and rural areas where ticks carry [encephalitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tick-borne-encephalitis#tab=tab_1). Ticks are active from March to November. Check your body for ticks and remove them as soon as possible.
* Medical treatment standards are reasonable, but facilities may be limited in rural areas. Hospitals and doctors may require payment upfront before they will treat you.
