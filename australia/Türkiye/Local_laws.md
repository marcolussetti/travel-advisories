# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Authorities have detained thousands of people suspected of having links to alleged terrorist groups. Detainees have limited rights.

Authorities may prevent foreigners and dual nationals from departing Türkiye.

#### Drugs

Penalties for using or possessing drugs are severe. They include long jail sentences.

#### Hiking Mount Ararat

Mount Ararat, between the eastern provinces of Agri and Igdir, is designated a 'special military zone'. You must hire the services of a locally licensed guide if you intend to hike in the area. A licensed company will obtain the necessary permits and assign you to a registered Mountaineer to accompany you throughout your hike. Visiting Mount Ararat without the Turkish government's permission is an offence that could incur severe penalties.

#### Other laws

By law, you must always carry a photo ID. Police conduct random checks regularly. Turkish authorities do not accept Australian driver's licences as ID. Carry your passport with you at all times. 

Illegal activities could result in severe penalties, including:

* taking photos of military installations
* searching for historical artefacts without authorisation
* defacing or destroying Turkish currency
* failing to comply with Turkish visa conditions or immigration regulations
* supporting terrorist organisations in Türkiye, including expressions of support on social media

It's also illegal to 'insult':

* Türkiye
* the Turkish flag
* the Turkish President or Government
* the founder of Türkiye, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk

This includes making insulting comments on social media. Penalties can be severe.

Selling or exporting antiquities and cultural artefacts without a permit is also illegal. You'll need a receipt and an official certificate to export these goods legally.

If you're arrested or detained, you may be deported from Türkiye. This may happen after your court hearings or after completing your sentence. You may be deported even if you're not convicted.

If you're arrested, ask the local authorities to tell the nearest Australian embassy or consulate.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Turkish government recognises dual citizenship.

However, Turkish-Australian dual nationals are treated as Turkish citizens in legal matters. If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/node/117) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

If you are a male Turkish-Australian dual national, you could be forced to complete military service when you arrive.

Check your obligations with an [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/204)of Türkiye before you travel.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in many parts of Türkiye. Some regions are more conservative than others.

Avoid offending locals by respecting religious and social traditions.

Dress modestly, particularly at mosques and religious shrines.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/news-and-updates/travelling-during-ramadan "Travelling during Ramadan") is observed in Türkiye. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking in public during the day may not be culturally appropriate in some areas. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. 

Some areas are more tolerant of travellers and locals who don't fast. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Explore our [Ramadan](/node/485) page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are legal but aren't widely accepted in Turkish society.

LGBTQIA+ events and gatherings may be subject to local government bans.

Avoid public displays of affection.
