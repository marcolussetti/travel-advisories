#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Türkiye. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Turkish authorities recommend that you carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Medical Tourism

Each year, many Australians travel for medical tourism. 

Unfortunately, things don't always go as planned. We're aware of several cases in recent years where Australians have experienced serious complications after their procedures in Türkiye.   

If you're considering medical treatment in Türkiye, you should do your research, including checking whether your insurance will cover you. Before you go, read our advice on [travelling overseas for medical tourism](/before-you-go/health/medical-tourism "Going overseas for a medical procedure (medical tourism)"). 

The [HealthTürkiye](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthturkiye.com%2Fhomepage&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7Cfa09d4e7421e429821a808dc52d8c6e2%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638476338540063288%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=L1wKXm8I30dObhb83atrXMf1Cw%2ByySUdsdRJ6RNVhEU%3D&reserved=0) portal lists the medical providers authorised by the Turkish Ministry of Health. We can't provide recommendations or endorsements for any particular health providers. You should discuss your plans carefully with your Australian doctor, dentist or hospital specialist before committing to any procedure overseas.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk from May to October in:

* Amikova
* Çukurova Plain
* the south-east

There's no malaria risk in the main tourist areas in the west and southwest of the country.

Other insect-borne diseases occur, including:

* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)
* [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever)

CCHF is common in:

* central Anatolia to the north

Seasonal summer outbreaks of CCHF have been fatal.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Türkiye varies.

Private hospitals with facilities comparable to those in Australia exist in major cities, but services can be limited outside of major cities.

Private hospitals usually need confirmation of insurance or a guarantee of payment before admitting a patient. Costs can be high.

Decompression chambers are available near popular dive sites and major cities in:

* Antalya
* Bodrum
* Istanbul
* Izmir
* Ankara
* Bursa

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may be able to receive treatment at a private or teaching hospital in Ankara or Istanbul. However, medical evacuation could be necessary, and it can be very expensive. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

Australians who reside in Türkiye for more than 12 months may have access to Türkiye's Universal Health Insurance (UHI).
