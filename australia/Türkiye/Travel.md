#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

You'll need an e-visa for tourism or business if you stay for less than 90 days in a 180-day period. Use the official Turkish government site to [apply for an e-visa](https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/) online.

Numerous fake and unauthorised websites may take payment without providing a visa or charge you for information on e-visas that you can get for free on the official website or through the Turkish Embassy in Canberra. 

The official website for Türkiye's e-Visa system is [evisa.gov.tr](https://www.evisa.gov.tr) and is managed by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Visa applications are processed by a third-party provider, [DTV Group](https://dtvgroup.com.tr). When you navigate to [evisa.gov.tr](http://www.evisa.gov.tr), you'll first be directed to dtvgroup.com.tr, then back to evisa.gov.tr once you select 'Apply for an e-Visa’ on the dtvgroup.com.tr site.

To ensure you're using the correct platform, you should access [evisa.gov.tr](https://www.evisa.gov.tr) directly, or by contacting your nearest Turkish embassy or consulate. Apply for a medical visa through the [HealthTürkiye](https://www.healthturkiye.com/homepage) online portal if you're travelling to Türkiye to seek medical services (see 'Health').

Different entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document.

If you're not eligible for an e-visa, you'll need to arrange a visa through an [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/204)of Türkiye before you arrive. If you don't, authorities may refuse entry.

If you're a tourist and arrive by sea, visiting the surrounding areas for up to 72 hours without a visa may be possible. Check your visa requirements with your travel operator or local authorities at the port of entry, and make sure you get entry and exit stamps in your passport. 

If you don't abide by your visa or permit terms, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering Türkiye.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/204) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border Crossings

All border crossings from Syria are currently closed.

Crossing the border to or from Iraq is difficult. Military activity in the region is ongoing. The Turkish Government tightly controls entry and exit.

#### Other formalities

If you enter or leave Türkiye by land or sea borders, make sure immigration authorities process you correctly. This applies even for a short trip, such as visiting the Greek Islands.

Make sure your passport is stamped for every exit and arrival. If you don't, you could face difficulties when departing, including:

* possible fines
* future travel bans
* detention
* deportation

#### Travel with children

If you're [travelling with a child](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") aged under 18 years, you may need to provide proof that you're the legal parent or guardian. Check with the [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/204) of Türkiye before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you are just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it will be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

EFTPOS and ATMs are widely available.

#### Local travel

#### Travel to the Gallipoli Historical Site

Winter storms and heavy traffic seriously affect many coastal roads around Gallipoli, including roads in the Gallipoli Historical Site.

* obey safety signs and directions
* don't wander off marked roads and tracks

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Türkiye for up to 6 months if you have a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

You must get a Turkish driver's licence if you plan to drive for longer than 6 months after your arrival in Türkiye.

#### Road travel

Travelling at night on country roads can be hazardous due to poor lighting and local driving practices.

Drink-driving carries a minimum penalty of:

* an on-the-spot fine
* confiscation of your driver's licence

Get to know the local road rules and practices.

Check if your travel insurance will cover you before driving.

In the event of a car accident:

* For accidents with only vehicular damage, exchange insurance information, take photos of the accident before moving the vehicles, and depart if both sides agree. Turkish law requires drivers to fill out a Turkish-only form and provide pictures of the damage. Non-Turkish speakers should call and wait for the police.
* For accidents involving an injury or a disagreement, remain at the site of the accident. Do not move the vehicle – even out of the way – until the Traffic Police arrive. Report the accident to the Traffic Police or Jandarma by dialling 112). Get a certified copy of the official report from the Traffic Police office (this can take several days).

#### Motorcycles

Avoid using motorcycles due to the poor standard of driving.

Check whether your travel insurance policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only licensed taxis or reputable limousine services. Arrange these through your hotel.

Taxis in major cities are generally professional, metered and charge according to set rates.

Insist your taxi driver uses the meter.

In rural areas and small towns, you may need to negotiate rates.

#### Public transport

Türkiye has an extensive inter-city bus and train network.

#### Air travel

International and domestic flights fly out of the new Istanbul Airport instead of Ataturk Airport.

Turkish airports and commercial aircraft have been the subject of terrorist attacks (see [Safety).](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/turkiye#safety)

Enhanced security measures are in place at major airports.

Airports are often crowded, and security checks can cause delays.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check Türkiye's air safety profile with the Aviation Safety Network.
