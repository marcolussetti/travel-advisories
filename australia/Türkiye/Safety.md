#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing high threat of terrorist attacks in Türkiye.

Most terrorist attacks have taken place in the southeast of the country, Ankara or Istanbul. 

Attacks could occur anywhere and at any time, including in places visited by foreigners. Possible targets include:

* tourist sites
* public transport and transport hubs
* markets/shopping malls
* government facilities
* diplomatic premises
* hotels, clubs, restaurants
* places of worship
* courts and the judiciary
* political parties
* parks
* major sporting and cultural events
* educational institutions
* airports

Terrorists have also previously targeted Western interests and places associated with the Turkish security forces, such as military barracks and police vehicles.

Previous methods of attack have included armed assaults, suicide bombings, car bombings, rocket attacks, arson, and improvised explosive devices left in garbage bins, crowded areas, shops, and public transport.

To protect yourself:

* be alert to threats, especially in public places and around significant dates
* keep a low profile and be aware of your surroundings
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for new and emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there is an attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so.

If you plan to travel to Türkiye to commemorate Anzac Day, understand the risks and plan ahead. Read our '[Travel overseas for Anzac Day'](/before-you-go/major-events/cultural-events/travel-overseas-anzac-day "Travel overseas for Anzac Day") page for further information on attending the event.

#### Border regions

The threat of terrorist attacks, violence and acts of war is high along the borders with Syria and Iraq. In the past, rockets have been fired from Syria and Iraq into Turkish territory.

#### South-eastern provinces

The south-eastern and eastern provinces see occasional clashes, particularly between the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist group and Turkish security forces.

Attacks by the PKK on government institutions, infrastructure and other sites have affected civilians.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Terrorist groups operating in Syria and Iraq kidnap and murder westerners. These groups may extend their operations into Türkiye.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance is limited.

You're responsible for your own safety. Read more on how to reduce your risk of being [kidnapped.](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning. 

There have been large protests across Türkiye, including in Istanbul, in recent days. Demonstrations and protests may continue and may turn violent. A protest ban is in effect and there are restrictions to freedom of movement for those suspected of participating in protests. This is likely to be strictly enforced.

Avoid protests and large public gatherings. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations occur regularly in major cities in response to:

* domestic events
* international events
* political developments

Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region. Large demonstrations have happened outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in major cities, particularly Israeli diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul. 

There are nearly 4 million Syrian and other refugees in Türkiye. Anti-refugee sentiment can be a source of tension and occasionally violence. 

Demonstrations can happen without warning. 

Extremists have targeted political protests.

Peaceful events can turn violent.

Protests in Istanbul have centred around:

* Taksim Square
* Istiklal Street
* streets surrounding Istiklal as far as the Galata Tower and down to Karakoy
* Besiktas
* Okmeydani on the European side
* Kadikoy on the Asian side

Protests in Ankara often centre around the Kizilay and Tunali areas. They have targeted diplomatic missions.

Protests also happen in other districts of Istanbul and Ankara and other cities and towns, including:

* Adana
* Antalya
* Hatay
* Izmir

May Day rallies on 1 May can become violent, particularly in Ankara and Istanbul.

Mass rallies often occur during the Persian New Year, 20 - 21 March.

Police break up crowds using the following:

* tear gas
* water cannons
* plastic bullets

Tear gas can spread to surrounding areas.

Local authorities can ban events such as public gatherings, celebrations, demonstrations and protests without much warning. 

They may also impose or extend curfews without warning.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid political gatherings, protests and demonstrations
* obey curfews
* monitor the media and other sources
* be alert around key dates, such as 20 to 21 March and 1 May
* plan your activities to avoid possible unrest on significant dates
* follow the advice of local authorities

Be prepared to change your travel plans. Contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help if there are transport disruptions.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Türkiye experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* floods
* drought
* fire

If there is a natural disaster or severe weather event:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact with friends and family
* monitor the media and other sources, such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes

[Earthquakes](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/earthquake "There's been an earthquake or tsunami") are a constant risk in Türkiye. There have been major earthquakes in recent years, including:

* 23 April 2025 in the Sea of Marmara off Istanbul, and
* February 2023 when 2 earthquakes occurred in Kahramanmaras province, close to Gaziantep, causing mass fatalities.

The North Anatolian fault runs 20km south of Istanbul and is one of the world's most active. Large, damaging earthquakes could happen at any time. Aftershocks can continue for days or weeks. Know the dangers of a major earthquake in your area and where your local shelter is located.

When an earthquake happens, you should drop, cover and hold. If an earthquake is long or strong and you're near the coast or other large body of water, you should go to higher ground immediately.

If you're indoors during an earthquake:

* move no more than a few steps to a heavy, solid object you can get underneath, and hold onto it
* don't try to run outside
* stay indoors until the shaking stops
* stay away from windows, chimneys, and shelves with heavy objects

If you're in bed:

* hold onto the bed and stay where you are
* protect your head and body with a pillow and blankets

If you're outdoors:

* move to the nearest clear spot
* keep away from buildings, trees and power lines
* drop to the ground

If you're in a car:

* slow down
* drive to a clear place away from buildings, trees and power lines
* stay in the car with your seatbelt on until the shaking stops

If you're in a lift:

* stop at the nearest floor and get out

After the earthquake finishes:

* be aware of possible tsunami risks
* prepare for travel delays
* reconfirm your travel arrangements
* check your accommodation with travel agents and tour operators
* let your family/friends know that you're safe

During a crisis, local authorities are responsible for helping people living or travelling within their jurisdictions.

#### Fire

Bush and forest fires often occur during the summer months, from June to September. Conditions can change quickly. Monitor the local media and follow the advice of local authorities. Read our advice on what to do if you're overseas and [there's a bushfire near you](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire "There's a bushfire")[.](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire) 

These are most common in heavily forested areas with high temperatures and low rainfall.

Fires have burned close to holiday areas, including:

* the Aegean coast
* the Mediterranean coast
* the Gallipoli peninsula

#### Floods

Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Türkiye, hampering overland travel and reducing the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable, and bridges may be damaged.

#### Drought

Severe drought conditions can affect the water supply to several cities.

Running water may not be available in many places, including hotels.

#### Crime

#### Theft and assault

Common crimes include:

* [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [assault](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas")
* pickpocketing
* bag snatching

Crime is especially common in the tourist areas of Istanbul, including:

* Taksim Square
* Sultanahmet
* the Grand Bazaar
* the Spice Bazaar

To stay safe, monitor local sources for information on crime and:

* pay close attention to your personal belongings, particularly on public transport and in crowded places
* avoid secluded parks and unlit areas
* avoid ATMs on the street, especially at night
* use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres

#### Sexual assault

Women may experience physical and verbal harassment. This is more common in regional and conservative areas.

There's been an increase in violent [sexual assaults](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") against women travelling alone or in small groups. Assaults have happened in popular tourist areas, including Istanbul and coastal resorts like Antalya. The assailant is often a person the victim has just met.

There have been reports of sexual assaults on minors alone in public toilets.

If you're a woman:

* avoid travelling alone, especially after dark
* avoid isolated locations
* be wary of new friends and acquaintances
* stick with people you trust

If a child in your care needs to use a public toilet, go with them.

#### Scams

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") commonly target travellers.

Friendly English-speaking locals may try to scam you out of thousands of dollars.

Typically, these scammers take you to a bar for food or drinks. You're then presented with an inflated bill, often thousands of dollars, and threatened with violence if you don't pay. These scams are regularly reported, particularly in Istanbul.

Scams involving inflated taxi prices or taxis taking longer routes than needed have also been reported. These are particularly common to and from airports in Istanbul. 

Scams are also common among carpet traders.

To protect yourself from scams:

* insist your taxi driver uses the meter
* pay attention to your surroundings
* be wary of deals where your carpet trader arranges to send you goods by post
* check current scams using [Scamwatch](http://www.scamwatch.gov.au), internet travel blogs and social media sites such as YouTube

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Food and drink spiking and methanol poisoning

#### Food and drink spiking

Foreigners, including Australians, have been drugged by English-speaking strangers who steal their belongings and passports.

Drugs can be present in:

* drinks
* food
* chewing gum
* confectionery

These drugs can cause you to become disoriented and compliant. You may even become unconscious.

To reduce your risk of food or drink spiking:

* be wary of overly friendly strangers
* don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new acquaintances
* never leave food or drinks unattended

#### Poisoning from alcoholic drinks

Locals and travellers have reported poisoning from alcoholic drinks. Drinks may be contaminated with harmful substances, including methanol.

People have become seriously ill, and some have died, after drinking contaminated alcohol in Türkiye.

Consider the risks when drinking alcoholic beverages, particularly drinks made with spirits.

Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

To stay safe:

* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* be wary of suspiciously cheap alcohol

Symptoms of [methanol poisoning](/before-you-go/health "Taking care of your health") can be similar to the effects of drinking too much. This includes fatigue, headaches and nausea.

If you suspect that you, or someone you're with, has been poisoned, get urgent medical attention. It could save you from permanent disability or death.

Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards, including adventure activities such as diving and ballooning.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts
* if proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider
