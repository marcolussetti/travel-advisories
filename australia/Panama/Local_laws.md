# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include lengthy prison sentences in local jails.

Authorities may arrest you for illegal drugs if you're either:

* carrying even a very small amount of drugs, or
* with someone who's using them
* If you're found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, authorities will arrest and possibly detain you.
* Border officials may screen you for drugs, including on departure.

#### Proof of identity

You must always carry an ID, such as a certified copy of your passport.

#### Other laws

In Panama, it's illegal to:

* join political activities or demonstrations if you're a foreigner
* take photos of an official building
* fail to wait with your vehicle after an accident until traffic police arrive

To avoid breaking the law:

* understand the local rules
* ask local authorities before taking photos of buildings

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Avoid public displays of affection.

Same-sex relationships are legal in Panama, but the country is conservative.

Same-sex marriages aren't recognised in Panama

It's not illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
