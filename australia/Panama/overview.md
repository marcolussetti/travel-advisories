## Overview

### Safety

* Panama has high crime rates. Petty crime is more common than violent crime. Take care of your belongings, especially in transport hubs. Violent crime includes armed robbery and muggings. Avoid high-crime areas of Panama City. Only use ATMs in banks or shopping centres. Don't go out alone.
* Colombian guerrilla groups and drug traffickers are active in the Darien Gap, near the Colombian border. Violent crime is common. Do not travel to this area.
* Demonstrations and protests can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.
* The hurricane season is from June to November, but storms can happen year-round. They can cause flooding and landslides and disrupt services. Know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plan. Find your nearest shelter.
* Panama experiences earthquakes. Tsunamis can also happen. Know the tsunami warning signs and move immediately to high ground. Don't wait for official alerts.

### Health

* Yellow fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel.
* Malaria is a year-round risk in Bocas del Toro, Darien and San Blas. It's not a risk in Panama City. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases include zika virus, dengue and chikungunya. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases include hantavirus, hepatitis, tuberculosis, rabies and brucellosis. Drink boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get immediate medical help.
* Some private hospitals and clinics are good. Facilities outside Panama City are limited. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation to the United States. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
