# Safety

#### Crime

Crime levels are high in Panama.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, mainly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. You're most at risk in Panama City and Colon.

Take extra care of your valuables in:

* airports
* bus terminals
* public transport

To prevent petty crime:

* be alert after dark
* avoid being on the streets alone
* pay attention in crowded areas
* use ATMs in daylight hours
* withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks or shopping centres

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

* pay close attention to your personal security.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Panama. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Darien Gap

Colombian guerrilla groups and drug traffickers are active in the Darien Gap, near the Colombian border.

Violent crime is common, including:

* kidnapping
* murder, including of foreigners
* armed robbery
* disappearances

The danger zone starts at the end of the Pan American highway at Yaviza and extends to the Colombian border. This area includes the Darien National Park and privately owned nature reserves, and tourist resorts.

Be aware of landmines in the area.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

[Express kidnappings](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/57) can occur in urban areas, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests and demonstrations can happen.

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It is illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Panama.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests and public gatherings
* check the media for reports of unrest
* follow advice from local authorities

If you encounter a protest, leave as soon as it is safe.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.
