#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Medication with pseudoephedrine is banned in Panama.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Panama. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use
* if needed, get DFAT to authenticate medical documents before you depart

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in Panama. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) is also widespread. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk throughout the year in Bocas del Toro, Darien and San Blas. It's not a risk in Panama City.

Outbreaks of [dengue](http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/disease/en/) and [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya) also happen.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash, bleeding nose or gums, or a severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common in Panama.

Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Hantavirus

Many [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/index.html) cases are reported in Los Santos province.

To protect yourself:

* don't touch live or dead rodents, burrows or nests
* avoid activities that stir up dust, such as sweeping or vacuuming

For outdoor activities:

* choose a campsite that's open and dry
* don't rest in tall grass or haystacks
* remove any food that may attract rodents

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common, including:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink water from a sealed bottle
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* make sure your vaccinations are up to date
* avoid getting water into your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated
* avoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Some private hospitals and clinics are good. Facilities outside Panama City are limited.

You usually need to pay cash upfront before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

Doctors will rarely agree to work with your travel insurer. You may need to be reimbursed after you pay cash for your treatment. Doctors may only speak Spanish.

If you are seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be expensive. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.
