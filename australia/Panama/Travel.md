#### Visas and Border Measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

If you arrive by air or land, you won't need a visa. You'll be granted an initial stay of 90 days when you arrive. The maximum 90-day period is not guaranteed, and the decision on entry and visa duration is at the discretion of immigration authorities.

To enter, you'll need to show proof of:

* the equivalent of $US1,000 or a credit card
* a return or onward travel ticket

If you're transiting on a cruise ship and Panama is a port of call, you won't need a visa. An immigration official will stamp your passport, and you'll be granted a stay of up to 90 days.

If you arrive by another type of boat, you'll need a visa, and must pay a fee of $US100, plus $US5 registration, for each passenger or crew member. There may be other fees, for example for cruising permits.

Make sure your passport is stamped on entry to Panama. You may face a fine up to $US1,000 and delays if you fail to present an entry-stamped passport when departing Panama.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the [nearest Panamanian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/156) for details about visas, currency, and customs.

#### Entry into Panama

You'll need to complete an online immigration and customs declaration form when you enter Panama. You can complete this at <https://declaraciondeviajero.ana.gob.pa/>

Paper declarations will continue to be accepted during the phased transition to a fully digital system.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through [the United States](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/united-states-america), ensure you meet all US entry or transit requirements, even if you are transiting through Hawaii.

#### Airport requirements

You'll need to pay a departure tax at the Tocumen Airport in Panama City. Check if your airline ticket already includes this cost.

If you're travelling to the US, you'll need evidence of an onward or return ticket. This applies even if you can enter the US under its visa waiver program.

#### Travel with children

Children aged under 18, who are Panamanian dual nationals or residents travelling to or from Panama alone, or with only one parent or guardian must have permission from both legal guardians.

Documents required to leave Panama include:

* their original birth certificate
* [notarised consent](/node/361) from non-travelling parents

If these documents are from outside Panama, you must have them [verified with an apostille stamp](/node/361).

Contact an embassy or consulate of Panama for details.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, contact the local police and make a report, and tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local coin currency is the Panama Balboa (PAB).

The banknote currency is the US Dollar (USD).

Beware of counterfeit currency, especially $US50 and $US100 notes.

You can't exchange Australian dollars in Panama.

You'll need to show your passport or a certified copy of your passport to exchange money.

Credit cards are widely accepted. Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work.

ATMs are available in major centres. Check your bank statements for ATM fraud.

#### Local travel

#### Tour Operators

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

You can drive with:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving hazards in Panama include:

* aggressive driving
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* drivers not following traffic laws
* few signs and poor lighting on rural roads
* inadequate street lighting
* sharing roads with pedestrians, bicycles, and farm animals

Heavy rains cause mudslides and collapse roads. Roads may be closed at short notice, especially during the hurricane and wet seasons.

Driving at night is dangerous. There are often night roadworks on the Pan-American Highway. There may not be signage for these roadworks.

Don't move your vehicle if you're in a motor vehicle accident. By law, you must remain at the scene until the traffic police arrive.

If you plan to travel by road:

* check your travel insurance covers it
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* lock doors and keep car windows up, even when moving
* avoid travel at night

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance may not cover you for accidents on a motorbike or quad bike. Check your insurance covers it.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis flagged from the street or at taxi stands may not be safe.

Use airport taxis or pre-book with a reputable company.

Airport taxi drivers wear clearly identifiable photo ID badges.

Taxi drivers often don't provide change, so be prepared to pay with small notes.

To safely use taxis:

* arrange your airport pickup with your hotel before you arrive
* note your taxi driver's name and licence number
* agree on the fare before you set off
* never share a taxi with a stranger
* don't let your driver pick up other passengers

Avoid public transport. Local buses don't follow set routes and are poorly maintained.

#### Sea travel

Many international cruise liners visit Panama.

The Pacific and Caribbean coastlines are transport routes for illegal drugs. Consider this security risk before deciding to travel by sea.
