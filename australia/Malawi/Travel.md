#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If you're travelling on an Australian passport, you won't need a visa if visiting Malawi for tourism purposes for up to 90 days. On arrival, you may only be granted a 30-day permission to stay. However, when you're in Malawi you can then apply for a 60-day extension by visiting a [Malawi Department of Immigration office.](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/physical-addresses/)

Australians wanting to migrate, work or do business in Malawi will need to apply for the appropriate visa. For more information, visit the [Malawian Department of Immigration website](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/), or contact your nearest Malawian diplomatic mission.

#### Border measures

You can only cross land borders during daylight hours. Check border opening times before you cross to confirm that immigration and customs services will be available.

You must have a valid [yellow fever vaccination certificate](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever) if you're arriving from an area or country with yellow fever.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Travel via South Africa

South African authorities do not accept provisional travel documents if you're transiting through South Africa. South African authorities do accept Australian emergency passports.   
Strict rules apply to a child aged under 18 years travelling through South Africa.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Malawi Kwacha (MWK).

Declare any foreign currency when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. When you leave, authorities will take any foreign currency you didn't declare on entry.

You're allowed to export foreign currency that you declare on entry. You're also allowed to export both:

* up to $US3000 with approval from a bank
* an approved amount of Kwacha, but authorities will take any amount over your limit when you leave

Ask Malawian authorities for advice if you want to export currency.

The $US is the most easily exchanged foreign currency. Some hotels and restaurants will accept payments in $US.

Credit cards and traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted in Malawi. Before you arrive, ask your host, hotel or tour operator about the best ways to pay.

ATMs are increasingly common but they often run out of cash. Some ATMs accept some Australian cards.

Ask your bank if your bank cards will work in Malawi.
