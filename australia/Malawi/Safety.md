#### Violent crime

Burglaries are common in residential areas. Criminals often carry weapons and may become violent. Lock your accommodation, even when you're in it.

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), seek immediate medical help. The risk of HIV infection is high.

Attacks on women wearing pants, leggings and short skirts have occurred in Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba. Female travellers in these areas may want to avoid wearing close-fitting clothing and should remain aware of their surroundings.   
  
Throughout the country, women travelling alone may be subjected to harassment and verbal abuse.

Carjacking is a hazard. Take care if you're driving:

* in urban areas, especially if you're in a 4WD vehicle

Don't resist if your vehicle is attacked.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.
