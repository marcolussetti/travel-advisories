# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. If you're convicted, you can get a long jail sentence.

#### Other laws

You must always carry a photo ID, such as your passport or driver's licence. Police conduct random checks, particularly at borders.

It's [illegal not to offer help to a person in danger](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F34551?lang=en). Authorities may charge you if you:

* don't stop after you witness a motor accident
* don't report an accident to emergency services
* ignore pleas for help or urgent assistance

Any assistance shouldn't put you or anyone else in danger. For example, if there's a fire, you're not expected to leap into the flames to save someone. Notifying authorities (dial 112) would be sufficient.

Penalties for not assisting can carry a fine of up to 100,000 euros and up to 7 years imprisonment. Tourists aren't exempt.

Forcing someone to hide their face is a crime in France. It's punishable by a year in prison and a fine of up to 30,000 euros. The sentence doubles if the person forced to hide their face is a minor.

It's illegal to photograph security forces, including the police. Penalties may include authorities detaining you and taking your film or camera.

Flying drones is prohibited in Paris. Prohibitions also exist in other locations in France. Check with local authorities.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
