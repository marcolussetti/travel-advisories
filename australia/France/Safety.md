#### Terrorism

France raised its [national terror alert warning](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/vigipirate) to the highest level in March 2024. Expect high-level security nationwide, including at schools, places of worship, shopping centres and landmarks. Terrorists could target the LGBTQIA+ community, music and cultural events, festivals, tourist areas, shopping areas, transport hubs, sporting events and other public areas. 

Attacks can occur at any time. Methods of attack have included knife attacks, shootings, bombings, and vehicle attacks.

There have been several attacks in France in recent years, including in:

* places of worship
* schools
* shopping areas
* tourist sites
* transportation hubs
* festivals
* other major events which attract large crowds

Be cautious around locations known to be possible terrorist targets.

Authorities have additional powers to deal with counter-terrorism security. In some public areas, they may:

* restrict access
* search your bags and vehicle

Expect increased security checks at borders, including ID checks, which may cause delays.

To reduce your risks:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report anything suspicious to the police
* monitor the news for any new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

In the event of an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

The French Government has published advice about [how to respond to a terrorist attack and information on France's national terrorist alert warning](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/Nos_missions/vigipirate-anglais-v2017.pdf).

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Strikes are frequent across France. When they occur, expect [demonstrations](/news-and-updates/demonstrations-and-unrest "Demonstrations and unrest") and significant disruptions, which usually affect public transport and other public services.

Some lead to clashes with police, resulting in the use of tear gas and arrests. Avoid demonstrations and areas with significant police activity. 

To reduce risks:

* avoid protests and demonstrations, and exercise caution if you're caught up in large gatherings/protests
* remain vigilant, especially at night
* monitor local media and other sources for news on possible unrest
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

Serious crime can occur especially in large cities, including Paris. These include violent robberies, muggings and assaults, including sexual assault. For further information, see Smartraveller information on when you're a victim of a [crime overseas](/while-youre-away/crime "If you're a victim of a crime overseas"), travel risk relating to [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and on the assistance to victims of [sexual assault overseas.](/while-youre-away/crime/sexual-assault-overseas "I've been sexually assaulted overseas")

Robberies could also lead to identity theft. If you think you've been the [victim of identity crime](https://www.afp.gov.au/crimes/fraud-and-corruption/identity-crime-australia), report it to [local police](https://www.masecurite.interieur.gouv.fr/en). Crimes such as passport theft, pickpocketing, burglaries and bag and phone snatching are common in summer. Groups of thieves also operate on public transport, including busy metro lines that service tourist attractions and trains to/from the airports. 

Take care to protect your belongings on public transport, in crowded tourist areas and at landmarks. Some examples of common targets include (but are not limited to):

* Airports (including Charles de Gaulle International Airport)
* Hotel lobbies
* Outside of hotels and well-known short-stay accommodations
* Restaurants and cafes, especially when sitting on the terrace.
* Beaches

Criminals use children to distract tourists or even play an active role in theft.

Violent theft is less common but may also occur on public transport or around major tourist attractions. These attacks have occurred on or around:

* Gare du Nord train station
* The train from CDG Airport to Gare du Nord train station.
* Metro lines in Paris, including lines 1, 2 and 6
* RER (regional) train lines linking Paris and its suburbs
* major tourist attractions (including, but not limited to, the Eiffel Tower area, the Champs-Elysées, the Louvre, the Palais Royal areas, the Les Halles district, and the Latin Quarter)

To protect yourself from theft:

* avoid walking in quiet and poorly lit streets, especially at night
* keep luggage and valuables out of sight
* use ATMs in secure locations such as banks and shopping centres
* keep your bank cards in your sight
* monitor local sources for information about possible safety or security risks

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Vehicle break-ins

Vehicle crime includes bag snatching from cars (including while driving, stopped or stuck in traffic), including on the highway between CDG Airport and Paris city centre, and theft and break-ins from unattended vehicles. Rental vehicles are often targets, even in small towns.

To protect yourself:

* never leave valuables in your car
* keep bags and luggage concealed and/or stored in the boot
* keep your vehicle locked at all times, including when driving
* use secure parking facilities, especially overnight
* be alert at isolated automated service stations
* beware of any person who waves at you to stop on the highway
* avoid sleeping in rest areas beside autoroutes (motorways) and major roads
* avoid sleeping in makeshift or unauthorised campgrounds on the outskirts of cities

#### Domestic Violence

French authorities have introduced emergency phone numbers for victims of domestic violence. In an emergency, call the police (dial 17) or a 24/7 [specialised hotline](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/actualites/A16929?lang=en)(dial 3919) to call for help.

#### Scams and fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud involving 'skimming' machines that can store card data can occur. Automated service stations and tourist areas are often targets for this.

Be wary of strangers who invite you for a free drink or show at a private club. Foreigners have had large amounts of money stolen from their credit cards before being allowed to leave.

Be cautious when booking travel. Use reputable travel providers only. Avoid giving your personal details to unknown sources. There have been reports of identity theft through accommodation scams.

Avoid common scams around tourist areas. These are often groups of petty criminals targeting foreigners and tourists.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Swimming safety

The beaches along the French Atlantic coast can be dangerous, especially on the south-western coast. Several people drown every year.

Swim at supervised beaches and follow the [colour-coded flags](https://www.france.fr/en/holiday-prep/practical-tips-what-you-need-know-about-french-beaches) that warn against dangerous swimming conditions.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Climate and natural disasters

France experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* avalanches
* mudslides
* [forest fires](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire "There's a bushfire")
* [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

If you're in an area affected by a natural disaster or severe weather:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family
* monitor local media

#### Avalanches and mudslides

Avalanches and mudslides can happen in some mountain areas. Several people have died in recent years.

If you're skiing or mountaineering:

* monitor advice on weather and safety conditions
* don't move off marked slopes or trails

In some areas, authorities may arrest or prosecute you if you ski or mountaineer off marked trails.

#### Forest fires

Forest and grass fires often occur during the summer months. You can track active fires on the EU's [European Forest Fire Information System](https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/effis_current_situation/).

The French government also provides a forest fire tracker on [Météo des forêts](https://meteofrance.com/meteo-des-forets) (in French).

#### Flooding

Flash flooding can make road travel extremely difficult. People have lost their lives due to flooding.

Disruptions to communication infrastructure may occur.
