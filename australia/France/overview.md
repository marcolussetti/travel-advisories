## Overview

### Safety

* [France's national terrorist alert warning](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/vigipirate) (in French) is at the highest level. Expect high-level security nationwide, including at schools, places of worship, shopping centres and landmarks. Terrorists could target the LGBTQIA+ community, music and cultural events, festivals, tourist areas, shopping areas, transport hubs, sporting events and other public areas. Be cautious around locations known to be targets. Attacks could be indiscriminate and could occur anywhere without warning. There have been several attacks in France in recent years.
* Serious crime can occur especially in large cities, including Paris. These include violent robberies, muggings and assaults, including sexual assault. Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. (see Safety - Crime).
* Crime such as theft, including passport theft, pickpocketing, bag snatching, burglaries and muggings are common, particularly in summer. Groups of thieves also operate on public transport, including busy metro lines and trains to/from the airports. Take care to protect your belongings on public transport, in crowded tourist areas and at landmarks.
* Strikes are frequent across France. When they occur, expect demonstrations and significant disruptions, which usually affect public transport and other public services. Some result in clashes with police, resulting in the use of tear gas and arrests. Avoid demonstrations and areas with significant police activity.
