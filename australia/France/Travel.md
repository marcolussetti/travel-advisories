#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

France is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter France without a visa in some cases. In other situations, you'll need a visa.

France Diplomacy provides a [comprehensive FAQ](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/) for foreigners wishing to visit France and an [online tool](https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/web/france-visas/visa-wizard#/)to assess what visa you need. 

Make sure you:

* Apply for your visa in Australia if you need one. You can't apply for a visa or change your status once you're in French territory. For example, you can't change from a tourist visa to a student or resident visa while in France.
* carry your passport when you cross borders, including within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")
* check border conditions with local sources and transport providers

You may still need a visa to transit. 

#### Border measures

There'll be increased checks and controls at France's borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain until 31 October 2025. You should allow for extra time when travelling. Non-EU citizens will need to show a valid passport, and Australians who are resident in France may need to show their carte de séjour too.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

#### Other formalities

Unaccompanied minors (under 18 years of age) who normally live in France and want to leave French territory need:

* their own identity document
* a copy of a parent or guardian's identification
* a completed form issued by the French Ministry of Interior

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some airlines won't let you board, and some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

Also, go to the nearest Commissariat de Police (police station) to:

* report the crime
* get a declaration of theft

Doing this could assist any insurance claims.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency in France is the Euro.

France is a member of the European Union (EU). If you travel between France and any non-EU country, you must declare over 10,000 euros (or equivalent) cash. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare or give the wrong information on entry or exit, you'll need to pay a fine.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### ANZAC Day

If you plan to travel to France to commemorate Anzac Day, understand the risks and plan ahead. Read our '[Travel overseas for Anzac Day'](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/644) page for further information on attending the event.

#### Driving permit

You'll need a valid Australian driver's licence to drive in France.

Car rental companies may also need an International Driving Permit (IDP) in addition to your driver's license (the IDP alone is insufficient). You should get your IDP before you leave Australia. Otherwise, you can apply for an [IDP online](https://www.internationaldrivingpermitsonline.com.au/) and have it shipped internationally for a fee.

If you live in France, you can swap your Australian driver's licence for a French licence. You must do this within your first 12 months.

#### Road travel

Unless otherwise signposted, drivers must give way to vehicles approaching from:

* the right at intersections
* side roads

This is the 'priority of the right' system. Understand this system so you avoid road accidents.

Be cautious when you drive or travel as a passenger. Keep your doors locked, even when moving. Lock your vehicle when you leave it.

The speed limit in most city centres is 30km/hr. 

There are penalties for breaking traffic rules. These may include:

* immediate loss of your licence and vehicle
* on-the-spot fines

All vehicles must carry a reflective vest and warning triangle for use during a breakdown.

The minimum driving age is 18 years.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your insurance policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use licensed official metered taxis. Licensed taxis have the sign 'Taxi Parisien' on the top of the car in Paris.

[Assaults](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas") and robberies have happened in unlicensed taxis. These taxis often target high-traffic destinations such as:

* airports
* train stations
* theatres
* nightclubs

Private car companies are legal, but you need to pre-book them.

#### Public transport

Organised strikes happen often. These may affect transport systems, including trains and airline traffic. Monitor the media and contact your travel provider for the latest details (see 'Safety').

If you use public transport, keep your ticket until you exit the system. Inspectors conduct random checks. You'll get an on-the-spot fine if you don't have a valid ticket.

Maintenance work on public transport is often carried out over the summer months, which requires metro lines to be shut down. In Paris, check the [RATP site](https://www.ratp.fr/en/).
