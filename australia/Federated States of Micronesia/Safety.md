# Safety

#### Crime

The crime rate is low. Petty crime happens, including house break-ins.

Travellers have reported [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and other [physical assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault").

The risk of crime is higher:

* at night
* when alcohol is consumed
* in the state of Chuuk

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep windows, doors and gates locked
* keep your vehicle locked
* avoid going out alone after dark or in the early morning
* avoid being alone in isolated locations, including beaches

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Don't comment about local or political events on your social media.
