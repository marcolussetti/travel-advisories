# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe, and include long jail sentences and heavy fines.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

Dress and behaviour codes are conservative. Take care not to offend. If you're a woman, wear clothing that covers your knees.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

No laws restrict the rights of LGBTQIA+ people or groups. However, social and cultural attitudes to same-sex relationships can be conservative.

Open affection between same-sex partners may attract negative attention and offend.
