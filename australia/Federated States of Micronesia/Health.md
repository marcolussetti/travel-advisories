#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the Federated States of Micronesia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* how much you'll take
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Hospital and medical facilities are limited. Basic supplies and medication can also be limited.

You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. The Federated States of Micronesia has no dedicated medical evacuation planes. They usually take at least 24 hours to arrive. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Evacuation can be delayed if you use commercial airlines due to infrequent flights.

Doctors and hospitals may ask you to pay before they'll treat you.

Facilities are limited for scuba-diving injuries. The Federated States of Micronesia has decompression chambers in Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei. These chambers are not always operational.

Access to services and trained staff varies widely.
