# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for possessing and using drugs may include fines and prison sentences.

New Zealand has strict biosecurity rules.

If you don't declare items for quarantine, you'll get an instant fine.

If you make a false statement, you'll face heavy fines and prison sentences.

#### Customs requirements

When you arrive, customs officers may check electronic devices they suspect are being used in criminal activity. Devices may include:
