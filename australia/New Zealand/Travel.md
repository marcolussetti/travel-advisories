#### Visas and border measures

Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. Contact [NZ Immigration](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. If you don't meet the conditions, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### Visa conditions

Most Australian citizens don’t need a visa to enter unless you have a criminal record or if you've been deported from any country.

Australian permanent residents need to apply online for a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) to enter New Zealand. Australian citizens are exempt from this rule.

For more information refer to the [NZ Government Immigration website](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/policy-and-law/how-the-immigration-system-operates).

If you've been:

* convicted of any crimes, or
* deported from any country

Contact a [New Zealand Visa Application Centre](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/about-us/what-we-do/partnering-with-industry/visa-application-centres) for advice well before you travel.

#### Border measures

You must complete a New Zealand Traveller Declaration Form (NZTD) before passport control on arrival. You need to answer questions about your trip and what you’re bringing into the country. You can complete it [online](https://www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/) or by using the NZTD app, there's no cost.

If you are a New Zealand visa or NZeTA holder you still need to complete an NZTD.

For more information see the [NZTD website](https://www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/).

#### Maritime border

New Zealand's maritime border is open to all vessels, including foreign flagged vessels, cruise ships, recreational vessels (such as yachts and small craft) and specialist vessels used in research and exploration.

For more information see the [New Zealand Customs Service – Travelling to New Zealand webpage](https://www.customs.govt.nz/personal/travel-to-and-from-nz/travelling-to-new-zealand/).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

New Zealand Immigration requires you to have 3 months of validity on your passport after the date you plan to leave. If you're planning to travel to another destination after leaving New Zealand, you may need more than 3 months validity on your passport after your departure date.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country.

New Zealand Immigration recognises gender 'X' on passports. If in doubt, contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the New Zealand Dollar ($NZ).

Declare all amounts over $NZ10,000 or equivalent on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

ATM availability is similar to Australia.

You can use debit or credit cards in most places as you would in Australia.

Contact your bank to let them know you'll use your cards overseas.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive for up to 12 months with your Australian driver's licence.

After that, you'll need to get a local licence.

**More information:**

* [Driver licences](http://www.nzta.govt.nz/driver-licences/new-residents-and-visitors/)

#### Road travel

Ice, snow, fog, high winds and roaming animals can cause hazardous conditions. Heavy rain can cause landslides across roads.

Outside major cities, there aren't many motorways. Overtaking opportunities are limited.

Prepare for longer travel times than in Australia.

Railway crossings don't always have barriers, particularly in country areas.

If you're driving in mountain areas or to ski fields, be aware that roads:

* are often narrow and unpaved
* may not have safety barriers
* may require you to use snow chains
* may only be accessible by 4WD

It’s illegal to use a mobile phone while driving, but there is an exemption for 111 calls in genuine emergencies. Hands-free devices and 2-way radio are permitted.

If you plan to drive in New Zealand:

* learn the [local road rules](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/driving-in-nz/) before driving
* be careful if there's ice, snow, fog or high winds
* check for road closures and warnings with the [New Zealand Transport Agency](https://www.journeys.nzta.govt.nz/highway-conditions)
* equip yourself for current and possible weather conditions

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your travel insurance covers using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis and rideshares are generally reliable. The standards are similar to Australia.

The [New Zealand Transport Authority](http://nzta.govt.nz/commercial-driving/taxis-shuttles-buses-and-other-passenger-services/new-passenger-service-rules-2017/i-need-to-hire-a-ride/) regulates taxis and rideshare apps.

#### Public transport

Buses, trains and ferries operate throughout New Zealand. State-run services are also regulated by the New Zealand Transport Authority.

Take care of your belongings on public transport.
