## Overview

### Safety

* Earthquakes are a constant risk. Large, damaging quakes can happen at any time. Know what to do during and after an earthquake.
* All of New Zealand's coastline is at risk of a tsunami. Know the tsunami warning signs and move to high ground immediately. Don't wait for official alerts.
* New Zealand has several active volcanoes. Volcanic alert levels may rise quickly. You may be ordered to evacuate at short notice. Stay informed and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Weather conditions can change quickly. Severe weather could leave you stranded or injured, especially in an isolated area. If you're climbing, hiking or in a remote area, contact the Department of Conservation. Carry a personal locator beacon.
* Crime rates are similar to those in Australia. Thieves often target vehicles. Don't leave valuables in your car or campervan.

### Health

* Make sure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.
* Medical facilities and services are of a similar standard to those in Australia.
* New Zealand and Australia have a reciprocal healthcare agreement. This lets Australians access public medical facilities and care. However, there are some things it doesn't cover. Ensure you get comprehensive travel insurance.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties may include fines and prison sentences, including for small amounts.
* Carry approved identification if you want to purchase alcohol or enter licensed premises. Approved ID includes your passport, a New Zealand driver's licence, an existing Hospitality NZ 18+ Card, or a Kiwi Access Card. An Australian driver's licence is not an approved form of ID under the NZ Sale and Supply of Alcohol Regulations.

### Travel

* You must complete a New Zealand Traveller Declaration Form (NZTD) before passport control on arrival. You need to answer questions about your trip and what you’re bringing into the country. You can complete it [online](https://www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/) or by using the NZTD app, there's no cost.
* Most Australian citizens don't need a visa to enter unless you have a criminal record or if you've been deported from any country. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.
* Before you travel, check [Immigration New Zealand's](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/your-journey-to-new-zealand/arriving-in-new-zealand) website for current entry restrictions and requirements.

* To stay up to date with local information, follow the High Commission’s social media accounts.
* For consular help, contact the [Australian High Commission in Wellington](https://newzealand.embassy.gov.au/wltn/home.html ), or the Australian Consulate-General in Auckland.
