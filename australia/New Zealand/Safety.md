# Safety

#### Crime

Crime rates in New Zealand are similar to those in Australia.

Thieves often target valuables left in cars and campervans.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests are generally peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

#### Climate and natural disasters

New Zealand experiences [natural disasters](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident), including:

* [earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis)
* [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis)
* [volcanic activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters)
* [flash flooding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters)
* [bushfires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/bushfire)

To protect yourself in a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with friends and family

Monitor local media and other sources, including:

* [Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* [GetReady website](https://getready.govt.nz/) (New Zealand government)

#### Severe weather

Weather conditions can change quickly. Severe weather can occur.

Creeks and rivers can experience [flash flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") after heavy rains.

Rapid weather changes could leave you stranded or injured, particularly if you're in a remote area.

Monitor weather conditions, forecasts and warnings from [Metservice](https://www.metservice.com/).

Take extra care if you're climbing, hiking or in a remote area.

#### Earthquakes

[Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") are a constant risk in New Zealand.

Most quakes are too small or deep in the earth to feel. However, about 150 to 200 quakes are big enough to feel each year.

Large, damaging earthquakes have occurred and could happen again at any time. Aftershocks can continue for days or weeks.

When an earthquake happens, you're advised to drop, cover and hold. If an earthquake is long or strong, and you're near the coast or large body of water, you should go to higher ground immediately as a tsunami may occur.

If you're indoors during an earthquake:

* move no more than a few steps to a heavy, solid object you can get underneath, and hold onto it
* don't try to run outside
* stay indoors until the shaking stops
* stay away from windows, chimneys, and shelves with heavy objects

If you're in bed:

* hold onto the bed and stay where you are
* protect your head and body with a pillow and blankets

If you're outdoors:

* move to the nearest clear spot
* keep away from buildings, trees, and power lines
* drop to the ground

If you're in a car:

* slow down
* drive to a clear place away from buildings, trees, and power lines
* stay in the car with your seatbelt on until the shaking stops

If you're in a lift:

* stop at the nearest floor and get out

After the earthquake finishes:

* be aware of possible tsunami risks (see below)
* prepare for travel delays
* reconfirm your travel arrangements
* check your accommodation with travel agents and tour operators

#### Tsunamis

Because of the region's earthquake risk, tsunamis could happen.

All of New Zealand's coastline is at risk of a tsunami. New Zealand is a member of the Pacific Tsunami Warning System.

The [National Emergency Management Agency](http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/) manages the National Tsunami Advisory and Warning Plan and issues tsunami alerts on its website. These are also broadcast by New Zealand media.

A tsunami could arrive within minutes. There may not be time for an official warning.

Move immediately to high ground, or as far inland as possible, if you're near the coast and you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings.

Walk or ride a bike if possible because of potential road congestion.

#### Volcanoes

New Zealand's active volcanoes can erupt at any time. Volcanic alert levels may rise quickly. You may be ordered to evacuate at short notice.

If there's volcanic activity:

* follow the instructions and advice of local authorities
* follow evacuation orders
* take official warnings seriously

If you plan to visit active volcanoes or surrounding areas:

* monitor the [GeoNet](http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano) website
* get local advice first

Visit [GeoNet](http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano) for information about volcanic activity at:

* Mt Ruapehu
* Mt Tongariro
* White Island
* other active volcanic sites

#### Bushfires

Parts of New Zealand experience [bushfires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") in hot, dry conditions.

If there's a bushfire, monitor local media and follow the advice from the local authorities.

#### Adventure activities

Most people enjoy adventure activities safely in New Zealand. However, these activities carry risks.

Several serious accidents involving Australians and other travellers have occurred. People have died.

Some operators have been found to be negligent.

Safety standards can differ both between individual operators, and from standards in Australia.

If you plan to do an adventure activity:

* be aware of the risks of individual or group activities
* check the safety standards of operators
* check to see if operators meet industry standards

Safety risks can increase in severe weather and remote areas.

Before you do any [adventure activities](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* make sure your [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") covers your planned activities
* understand what your travel and other insurance doesn't cover
* only book with operators with appropriate safety equipment and practices
* always use the safety equipment, even if others don't

If you're trekking or travelling in a remote area:

* get updates on local weather from the [Department of Conservation](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/know-before-you-go/alerts/) (DOC)
* check conditions with the local DOC [visitor centre](https://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/visitor-centres/) for further information
* tell your family and friends your plans
* carry a personal locator beacon
* avoid creeks and rivers after heavy rains

You can hire personal locator beacons throughout New Zealand.

When you return from a hike, check in with:

* the DOC visitor centre
* your family and friends
* anyone else who knew your plans
