#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave.

Your policy must cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you need counselling services in New Zealand, contact:

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in New Zealand. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Health risks are broadly similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities and services are of a similar standard to those in Australia.

#### Reciprocal health care

New Zealand and Australia have a [reciprocal health care agreement](https://www.health.govt.nz/new-zealand-health-system/eligibility-publicly-funded-health-services/reciprocal-health-agreements). This lets Australians access public medical facilities and care.

It doesn't:

* include ongoing treatment of existing health conditions
* cover extra accommodation costs or flights for family members
* cover flights to Australia
* replace the need for travel insurance.

To access services under the agreement:

* show your current Australian passport or evidence of permanent residency
* show your valid Medicare card.

#### Accident Compensation Corporation

If you're injured in an accident, the [Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC)](https://www.acc.co.nz/) covers the costs of hospital treatment.

The cover provided by ACC:

* offers injury cover on a 'no-fault' basis — this means accident victims don’t have a legal right to sue a third party
* ends once you've left New Zealand
* doesn't replace your need for [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance")
