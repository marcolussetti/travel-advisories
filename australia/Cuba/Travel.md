#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

You need a visa to enter Cuba.

If your visit is for tourism, you can get a 'tourist card' through:

* your travel agent or airline
* an [embassy or consulate of Cuba](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/52)

The tourist card includes a tourist visa.

In other situations, you need to apply for a visa.

You're required to fill in an [online declaration form](https://www.dviajeros.mitrans.gob.cu/inicio).

#### Impact on US ESTA by travelling to Cuba

If you've travelled to Cuba since January 2021, you're not eligible to participate in the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP). You can’t enter or transit the US on an ESTA, including for medical evacuations. You’ll need to apply for a visa from the nearest [US Embassy](https://www.usembassy.gov/). Contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate for details.

#### Other formalities

You must show proof of comprehensive travel insurance to enter.

You need to purchase extra insurance from Asistur, the Cuban insurance provider if you:

* plan to do a high-risk sport or compete in a sport
* are aged 70 years or older

To contact Asistur, call +53 7866 4499.

The list of duty-free items that you can take into Cuba is limited. If customs authorities consider any item isn't for personal use, they can seize it. Equipment that draws heavily on electricity or uses satellite technology can also be confiscated.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Cuba](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/52) for details about official requirements for minors travelling without their parents.

A departure tax is included in the cost of your airline ticket.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
