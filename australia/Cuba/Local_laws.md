#### Local law

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include lengthy prison sentences in local jails.

#### Other laws

You must always carry photo ID. Authorities can detain you if you're found without it.

Contact the [Embassy of Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/cuba/index.aspx?lang=eng) in Havana if you lose your Australian passport or other identification documents.

Serious crimes, such as espionage and mass murder, can attract the death penalty.

Under Cuban law, charges aren't laid until the investigation is complete.

If you're accused, you can be jailed during the investigation.

In Cuba, it's illegal to:

* drink-drive
* engage in black-market activities
* take photos of military or police sites, harbours, rail or airport facilities

Get local legal advice before preaching religion or importing religious material. Doing so may be illegal.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Cuba doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.
