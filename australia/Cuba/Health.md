#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Cuba. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Many medications are in short supply or unavailable in Cuba.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Outbreaks of [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) and [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya) are common. Risks are higher during the wet season, from April to November.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends you discuss travel plans with your doctor. Consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical help if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Medical care

Public medical facilities in Havana are basic.

Standards are limited in smaller towns and rural areas.

Private medical facilities are well-equipped. However, the only private hospital for travellers in Havana is the Cira Garcia Hospital.

State-run Servimed clinics can provide emergency medical care in major tourist areas.

Doctors and hospitals require cash payment before treating you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may be evacuated to get proper care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
