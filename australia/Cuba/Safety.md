# Safety

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Foreigners may experience violent crimes, such as [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crime is common, especially on public transport and intercity buses.

It also happens at major tourist areas such as:

* Old Havana
* El Centro
* Vedado
* the Malecon
* the beaches of Playa del Este, Varadero and Santiago de Cuba

Power outages are common and can last from minutes to several hours. The opportunity for theft increases during these outages.

Thefts from hotels and guesthouses occur. Keep the doors and windows at your accommodation locked.

#### Airport-based crime

People have reported thefts from checked baggage at Cuban airports.

When travelling through airports, keep a close eye on your valuables, including during security screening. Keep your valuables on you or place them in your carry-on baggage on flights. Don't check in jewellery, cameras or electronic devices.

Criminals posing as tour agents or taxi drivers operate at the airport and in Havana.

#### Road-based crime

Thieves may slash car tyres and help with repairs while an accomplice steals from the vehicle. Thieves who pose as hitchhikers are also common.

To protect yourself from road-based crime:

* only use established tour operators and registered taxis
* keep doors locked, windows up, and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* don't pick up hitchhikers
* be wary of people who offer to help if your car is damaged

If you're a victim of crime or theft, get a written police report (Comprobante de Denuncia) from the Cuban police (Policia Nacional) before you leave Cuba. Be aware that you can't get a police report once you leave Cuba.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Fraud

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Be careful when using debit or credit cards:

#### Overcharging

Some establishments, particularly taxis and classic car rentals, may attempt to impose excessive fees, potentially leading to disputes and violence.

* Confirm prices before using a service or consuming goods
* Avoid running tabs
* Refrain from leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill to ensure accuracy.

#### Scams

Some individuals specialise in deceiving tourists, often presenting as friendly English speakers. They may offer tour guide services or assistance purchasing items and resorting to violence to achieve their objectives. Only use reputable tour operators and registered taxis

Solo travellers

If you're a victim of sexual assault, promptly report the incident to the nearest Australian Embassy or Canadian Embassy in Havana and seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, reporting the incident to Cuban authorities is essential, ensuring that local police provide you with a 'Comprobante de Denuncia' confirming the report filing.

A criminal investigation may not be possible if a formal complaint is not made to Cuban authorities before departing the country.

#### Food and drink spiking

Be cautious about snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes as they may contain drugs, putting you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network in Cuba may be unreliable and intermittent.

Some international cell phones may not work, especially in rural areas. Internet access is limited across the island. Local authorities control telecommunications and may block access during civil unrest or before demonstrations.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Local authorities may break up demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government. They may also block access to the Internet, including social media, without notice. Be aware that participating in demonstrations in Cuba might be illegal.

To protect yourself during periods of civil unrest:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and public gatherings
* monitor the media for reports of potential unrest, and avoid those areas
* leave an affected area as soon as it's safe
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

#### Swimming

Rescue services may not consistently meet international standards and unpredictable tidal changes can result in powerful currents and rips. Lifeguards and warning flags may not be present on all beaches to signal hazardous conditions. Avoid swimming alone or after hours.

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not adhere to international standards. Choose a reputable company with proper insurance coverage.

#### Recreational Boating

If planning a boating excursion, familiarise yourself with navigation rules and carry a VHF marine radio that can relay your position in case of an emergency.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Cuba experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [hurricanes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/346)
* [severe storms](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/tropical-storms)
* [earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis)
* [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/346)

If a natural disaster happens:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local media
* follow the advice of local emergency officials
* keep in contact with friends and family

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

The hurricane season is from June to November. Landslides, mudslides and flooding also occur. The direction and strength of hurricanes can change suddenly.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* you may not be able to leave the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* you may not be able to access ports
* roads could be blocked

Natural disasters can disrupt essential services. This includes power, communication systems, emergency and medical care, food, fuel and water supplies.

In some areas, adequate shelter from a hurricane may not be available if you stay.

If a hurricane is approaching:

* know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plans
* identify your local shelter
* closely monitor alerts and advice from the [US National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) and local authorities

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Cuba is in an active earthquake zone. Tsunamis can also happen.

Familiarise yourself with earthquake safety measures for each place you stay and visit.

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/).

Move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Do not wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
