# Safety

#### Crime

Foreigners may experience violent crimes, such as [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Petty crime is common, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. You're at risk.

Take extra care of your valuables in:

* Airports
* Bus terminals
* Public transport
* Tourist areas

It also happens at major tourist areas such as:

* Old Havana
* El Centro
* Vedado
* the Malecon
* the beaches of Playa del Este, Varadero and Santiago de Cuba

Power outages are common and can last from minutes to several hours. The opportunity for theft increases during these outages.

Thefts from hotels and guesthouses occur. Keep the doors and windows at your accommodation locked.

To prevent petty crime:

* Be alert after dark
* Avoid being on the streets alone
* Pay attention in crowded areas

#### Airport-based crime

People have reported thefts from checked baggage at Cuban airports.

When travelling through airports, keep a close eye on your valuables, including during security screening. Keep your valuables on you or place them in your carry-on baggage on flights. Don't check in jewellery, cameras or electronic devices.

Criminals posing as tour agents or taxi drivers operate at the airport and in Havana.

#### Road-based crime

Thieves may slash car tyres and help with repairs while an accomplice steals from the vehicle. Thieves who pose as hitchhikers are also common.

To protect yourself from road-based crime:

* only use established tour operators and registered taxis
* keep doors locked, windows up, and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* don't pick up hitchhikers
* be wary of people who offer to help if your car is damaged

If you're a victim of crime or theft, get a written police report (Comprobante de Denuncia) from the Cuban police (Policia Nacional) before you leave Cuba. Be aware that you can't get a police report once you leave Cuba.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Express kidnappings can occur in urban areas, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM to force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Scams and Fraud

Scams and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards:

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Cuba. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

Some individuals specialise in deceiving tourists, often presenting as friendly English speakers. They may offer tour guide services or assistance purchasing items and resorting to violence to achieve their objectives. Only use reputable tour operators and registered taxis.

#### Overcharging

Some establishments, particularly taxis and classic car rentals, may attempt to impose excessive fees, potentially leading to disputes and violence.

* Confirm prices before using a service or consuming goods
* Avoid running tabs
* Refrain from leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff
* Check your bill to ensure accuracy.

#### Sexual assault

If you're a victim of sexual assault, promptly report the incident to the nearest Australian Embassy or Canadian Embassy in Havana and seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, reporting the incident to Cuban authorities is essential, ensuring that local police provide you with a 'Comprobante de Denuncia' confirming the report filing.

A criminal investigation may not be possible if a formal complaint is not made to Cuban authorities before departing the country. 

#### Food and drink spiking

Be cautious about snacks, beverages, gum and cigarettes as they may contain drugs, putting you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Telecommunications

The telecommunications network in Cuba may be unreliable and intermittent.

Some international cell phones may not work, especially in rural areas. Internet access is limited across the island. Local authorities control telecommunications and may block access during civil unrest or before demonstrations.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country. Local authorities may break up demonstrations or gatherings not sanctioned by the government. They may also block access to the Internet, including social media, without notice.

It's illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Cuba.

To protect yourself during periods of civil unrest:

* avoid protests, demonstrations and public gatherings
* Check the media for reports of unrest
* Follow advice from local authorities

If you see a protest, leave as soon as it’s safe.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Tours and adventure activities

#### Swimming safety

Rescue services may not consistently meet international standards and unpredictable tidal changes can result in powerful currents and rips. Lifeguards and warning flags may not be present on all beaches to signal hazardous conditions. Avoid swimming alone or after hours.

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not adhere to international standards. Choose a reputable company with proper insurance coverage.

#### Recreational Boating

If planning a boating excursion, familiarise yourself with navigation rules and carry a VHF marine radio that can relay your position in case of an emergency.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Cuba experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:
