#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

Medical care is expensive. If you're not insured, you may find yourself paying thousands of dollars for medical treatment.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you become mentally unwell and become a public nuisance or a danger to yourself or others, you could be detained and hospitalised to receive psychiatric treatment. You may not be able to leave treatment until you are well again or can have someone collect you from the hospital.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Singapore. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Strict rules control substances in personal medication. Some medications, including ones for ADHD and prescription pain medication, need prior approval before being brought into Singapore. Medicinal marijuana is not permitted. Check the [Singapore Health Sciences Authority](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/content/hsa/en/Health_Products_Regulation/Consumer_Information/Personal_Import_Regulations/bringing_personal_medication_into_Singapore.html) for a list of controlled substances, including how to apply for approval at least 10 working days before you arrive.

You don't need pre-approval if you don't leave the airport transit zone (without clearing Singapore immigration). However, cannabis and cannabis products are not permitted, even in transit. Be aware that prohibited substances, such as chewing gum, cannabis and products containing cannabis extracts, are not allowed to be brought with you. If you take prescribed medicinal cannabis, you should contact the [Singapore Health Science Authority](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/personal-medication) to review your situation and consider alternate travel arrangements.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

There is some spread of [Zika](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) virus. There's no vaccination for it.

If you're pregnant:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

Outbreaks of other insect-borne illnesses can happen. These include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis)

The risk of insect-borne illnesses increases during the wetter months, from December to March and June to September. Follow the [National Environment Agency's](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika) advice for preventing and identifying dengue and Zika infection. Dengue fever is endemic in Singapore, and the number of reported cases remains high.

Areas are regularly 'fogged' to stop the spread of insect-borne illnesses. The 'fog' includes toxic chemicals. Don't travel to areas straight after fogging.

To protect yourself against illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel
