#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

In most circumstances, such as tourism, travel for business meetings or conferences, Australian passport holders do not require a visa for stays up to 90 days. Other passport holders should check with the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoint Authority if they need a visa to enter Singapore. [ICA | Check if You Need an Entry Visa](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore/visa_requirements)

At immigration, you may have to show:

* a passport with at least 6 months validity
* evidence of enough funds for your intended stay
* a confirmed onward or return flight ticket
* a valid visa to enter your next destination
* yellow fever vaccination certificate, if required [ICA | Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore/yellow-fever-vaccination-certificate)

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [high commission, embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/179) of Singapore for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

If you breach your visa conditions or overstay your visa, authorities may fine, detain, cane and/or deport you.

#### Employment Visa

You'll need to apply for a visa to be employed or study in Singapore. Check work visa information with the [Ministry of Manpower](http://www.mom.gov.sg/Pages/default.aspx).

#### Border measures

On arrival in Singapore, you'll need to show:

* your completed [Singapore Arrival Card (SGAC)](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) (there is no charge for the SGAC). This can be completed within three days of your arrival in Singapore. There are scam websites that ask for payment. Make sure you use the official ICA website.
* a yellow fever vaccination certificate, if needed

More information is available on the [ICA | Entering, Transiting and Departing website](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart).

#### Transit through Singapore

Singapore is open to all transit travellers. See [Changi Airport website](https://www.changiairport.com/en.html) for more information on transiting.

Do not bring medicinal cannabis to Singapore, even during transit. If you take prescribed medicinal cannabis, you should contact the [Singapore Health Science Authority](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/) to review your situation. 

Check flight schedules directly with your airline. Confirm your arrangements with your airline or travel agent before travelling.

Expect to be screened during your transit in Singapore. You may be security screened when boarding your flight to Singapore and before boarding your connecting flight. See [Changi Airport website](https://www.changiairport.com/en.html) for further information on transit requirements.

Check the [Immigration & Checkpoints Authority website](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19) or [Changi Airport](https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19.html) for the latest advice.

#### Other formalities

You may need to scan your thumbprints each time you arrive and depart Singapore. Children aged younger than 6 years don't need to.

#### Medication

If you're carrying medication that's controlled in Singapore, you'll need an import permit to show on arrival. (See '[Health](#health)')

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries, including Singapore, won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
