# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Unauthorised public demonstrations are illegal.

You need a police permit for:

* a public gathering to which the public has been invited, even if you are the only person demonstrating or protesting
* a public procession of 2 or more people to which the public has been invited

Public demonstrations are only allowed at Speakers Corner in Hong Lim Park. Non-permanent residents need a permit to join any activities at Speakers Corner. Penalties can be severe.

#### Crime

Violent crime against tourists is rare.

Pickpocketing and street theft can occur at the airport, tourist destinations, hotels and on public transport.

Watch your belongings, especially in tourist areas and on public transport.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

Impersonation scams happen regularly.

Scammers are using automated voice calls or text messages or impersonating local government officials (e.g. from the Ministry of Health or Immigration & Checkpoints Authority), bank or telco staff. Calls ask for personal details and often use scare tactics (such as claiming you have committed an offence or have account issues). You should hang up immediately if the caller cannot identify themselves correctly. Always verify the information or request through official websites or call the company/department hotline before offering any personal information. Delete text messages immediately.

Property rental [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) happen.

Con artists pretend to be landlords on property websites and offer fake rental properties.

To protect yourself from property scams:

* research the property and landlord before agreeing to a property rental or purchase contract. See the [Singapore Land Authority](https://www.sla.gov.sg/) for information.
* don't make large payments in cash
* only use accredited property agents
* make sure landlords and agents are present when you sign tenancy documents

Be wary of dishonest retailers of mobile phones, electrical goods and cameras.

Information about known scams is available on the [Scam Alert website](https://www.scamalert.sg)[.](#_msocom_1)

If you live in Singapore, go to the [Consumers Association of Singapore](http://www.case.org.sg/) to lodge a complaint.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could happen in Singapore. Attacks could be random and may affect places that Westerners frequent.

Singapore has enhanced security measures, including:

* strong border controls
* security and police surveillance
* restrictions on access to some public venues

Ministers have issued public warnings about the seriousness of the terrorist threat.

The Singapore government has developed the [SG Secure](https://www.sgsecure.sg/resources) app to help prevent terrorist incidents and alert people to security or other threats.

Possible terrorist targets include businesses and public areas popular with travellers.

These include:

* hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars
* schools
* places of worship
* outdoor events and markets
* tourist areas
* transport hubs, such as train stations
* places associated with the Singapore Government

To stay safe:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious activity or items to police
* monitor the media for new threats
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.
