# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Singapore can impose a jail sentence if you are charged with shoplifting, drink driving and outrage of modesty. Shoplifting is a serious crime, including for low-value items.

If you commit a crime in Singapore and leave before you're caught, you may be arrested and charged the next time you arrive in or transit through Singapore.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble, stop you from going to jail or get you out of jail.

Jail sentences will result in the cancellation of your visa/employment pass, and you will be deported from Singapore after you have served your sentence. Your travel plans could be disrupted, and your travel insurance might not cover you. Lawyers are expensive in Singapore, and there are no public defence lawyers.

If you're arrested, authorities may detain you while police investigate. You can be legally detained for up to 48 hours (including for minors), during which time you may not be allowed to speak with anyone, not even a lawyer or the High Commission. The Police are not required to notify anyone of your arrest during this period, including the High Commission. These laws also apply to minors.

Police confiscate your passport if you're under investigation. There is no set timeline for investigations, which can take several weeks or months. For serious offences, investigations and court proceedings can take years. You won't be allowed to leave Singapore until the investigation is completed. You can't get a replacement passport until legal matters are settled. You must be able to support yourself financially during this time.

#### Drugs

Drugs are illegal in Singapore. The penalties for use, possession or trafficking are severe, including the death penalty. It's illegal to have drugs in your system. This includes traces being found in blood, urine and hair tests.

You can be charged for consuming drugs even if you took them outside Singapore and, regardless of if you took them in a country where it was legal to do so.

Do not bring medicinal cannabis to Singapore, even during transit. If you take prescribed medicinal cannabis, always carry a letter from your doctor, and you should contact the [Singapore Health Science Authorit](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/)y to review your situation.

Severe penalties for drug offences include the death penalty and caning.

Drunk and disorderly conduct in public is an offence.

These include:

#### Racial crimes

Penalties are severe for crimes that affect social, racial or ethnic harmony. These include racial insults and promoting ill-will and hostility between different races or classes.

If you want to speak publicly on racial, communal, religious or political topics, you must apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass from the [Ministry of Manpower](http://www.mom.gov.sg/).

#### Alcohol and vaporiser (vape) laws

Serious penalties, including detention or jail, apply for these illegal activities:

* being drunk, behaving badly or using offensive language
* importing vaporisers, such as e-cigarettes, e-pipes, e-cigars, and refills into Singapore, including for your own use
* driving under the influence of alcohol
* drinking alcohol in public places between 10.30pm and 7am
* drinking alcohol in a Liquor Control Zone

Liquor control zones include specified areas in Geylang and Little India. Additional restrictions apply on weekends and public holidays.

#### Copyrighted and prohibited material

Material that is legal in Australia may be illegal in Singapore. Serious penalties apply, including detention or jail, for bringing:

* pirated copyright material
* printed and recorded material considered obscene or prohibited

#### National Service

If you are or have been a Singaporean Permanent Resident or a dual Australian Singaporean citizen under the age of 21, or either of your parents are or have been Singaporean Permanent Residents or Singaporean citizens when you were a child, know your obligations regarding National Service requirements before deciding to travel to, transit through or live in Singapore. There have been instances of people visiting Singapore years after living there being arrested on arrival for not completing national service requirements. Renouncing your citizenship or permanent residency may not result in National Service requirements being waived. 

If you fall into any of the categories above, are already in Singapore and intend to leave for an extended period of time, you may wish to seek legal advice on any possible exemptions you may need to obtain prior to departure.  
  
See [Central Manpower Base (CMPB) National Service](https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/) and [OneNS - National Service](https://www.ns.gov.sg/web) for further information or seek legal advice before you travel.

#### Other laws

Serious penalties, including detention or imprisonment, apply for these illegal activities:

* illegal immigration
* overstaying your visa
* being caught with weapons, military souvenirs, replica weapons or ammunition, including empty cartridges
* working without a valid work pass — (see '[Travel](#travel)')
* taking photos of official buildings where there are signs banning photos

Same-sex acts have been decriminalised in Singapore, however the law does not recognise same sex partners or marriage. This extends to how same-sex partners are treated under Singapore's visa and immigration policies.   
  
You should be aware of local sensitivities. Behaviour standards are conservative, and public displays of affection may offend.

If you're [working in Singapore](/before-you-go/activities/living-overseas "Going overseas to live or work"), your work pass may be cancelled if you break the law.

#### Local customs

Behaviour standards are conservative.

Public displays of affection may offend.

When eating at food stalls, locals will "chope" a table by placing an item such as a tissue packet or an umbrella to reserve the table while they are collecting their food. After eating, be sure to tidy your table and return your food tray to a return station. It is against to law to not do so.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Dual nationals

Singapore doesn't recognise dual nationality for people aged over 21 years.

Male citizens and permanent residents between the ages of 16 and 50 must do 2 years of national service. They must also do further training after completing national service.

If you are or have been a Singaporean Permanent Resident or a dual Australian Singaporean citizen under the age of 21, or either of your parents are or have been Singaporean Permanent Residents or a Singaporean citizen when you were a child, know your obligations regarding National Service requirements. There have been instances of people visiting Singapore years after living there being arrested upon arrival for not completing national service requirements. Renouncing your citizenship or permanent residency may not result in National Service requirements being waived.

If you're a dual citizen or want permanent residency, know the national service requirements before deciding to travel to, transit or live in Singapore. Failure to complete national service may result in penalties, including custodial sentences.

If you fall into any of the categories above, are already in Singapore and intend to leave for an extended period of time, you may wish to seek legal advice on any possible exemptions you may need to obtain prior to departure.
