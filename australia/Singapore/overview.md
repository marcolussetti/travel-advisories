## Overview

### Safety

* Scammers call or send text messages and pretend to be local government officials, banks or telecommunications companies in an attempt to obtain your personal information. If you have suspicions about a call you receive, hang up immediately, delete texts, and immediately verify by contacting the agency or company's official numbers (available on their website).
* Violent crime against tourists is rare. Petty crime, such as theft and pickpocketing, can occur at the airport, in tourist areas and on public transport. Safeguard your belongings.
* Scammers pretend to be landlords on property websites and offer fake rental properties. Research the property and landlord before agreeing to a property rental or sale contract.
* Terrorism is a possible threat. Perpetrators may be self-radicalised individuals. Potential targets include businesses and public areas popular with foreigners. Take official warnings seriously.
* Strong winds and heavy rain can occur during the monsoon seasons from December to March and June to September. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local officials.
* Unauthorised public demonstrations are illegal. You need a police permit for any public gatherings, even if you're the only person demonstrating or protesting. Public demonstrations are only allowed at Speakers Corner in Hong Lim Park. If you're not a permanent resident, you need a police permit to join these.

### Health

* The standard of medical facilities and care is similar to or higher than in Australia. The cost is much higher, and payment may be required upfront. Ensure your travel insurance covers medical costs.
* Bringing personal medication into Singapore may require approval (including when transiting Singapore). If in doubt, check and seek approval with the Singapore [Health Sciences Authority](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/personal-medication/overview#:~:text=You%20may%20need%20to%20apply,be%20prosecuted%20under%20Singapore%20law.).
* Dengue fever is endemic in Singapore. The number of reported cases remains high. Follow the [National Environment Agency](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue/dengue-cases) advice to mitigate the risk of transmission.
* Zika virus is a risk. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor. Other insect-borne diseases include chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.
* Smoke haze may occur from June to October. The [National Environment Agency](http://www.nea.gov.sg/) gives updates and health warnings.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia. Penalties for the use and possession of drugs include caning and the mandatory death sentence for some trafficking offences. It is a crime to have drugs in your system, and you can also be charged for using drugs, even if it was outside Singapore.
* Singapore has strict laws and penalties for acts that are legal or minor offences in Australia. These include smoking in public, including restaurants, spitting, importing or chewing gum, chewing tobacco, littering and jaywalking. Charges of drink driving, theft, shoplifting, and assault have mandatory penalties, which may include time in jail. We are unable to stop you going to jail. If you commit a crime in Singapore and leave before you're caught, you may be arrested and charged the next time you enter or transit through Singapore.
* Shoplifting is a serious crime, including for low-value items and Australians have been jailed. We are unable to stop you going to jail. Singapore has a large number of CCTV cameras, including particularly at Changi Airport terminals, and police can identify suspects from CCTV footage.
* Singapore has strict laws for 'outrage of modesty' offences or being drunk and disorderly in public. You should avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation, including inappropriate touching or language. Penalties include jail, fines and caning. You should be aware of local sensitivities. Behaviour standards are conservative, and public displays of affection may offend.
* If you're arrested, authorities may detain you while police investigate. You can be legally detained for up to 48 hours (this includes minors), during which time you may not be allowed to speak with anyone, not even a lawyer or the High Commission.
* Strict laws control alcohol, e-cigarettes and vaporisers. Importing vaporisers, including for your own use, is illegal. It's illegal to drink within a Liquor Control Zone or in public between 10.30pm and 7am.
* Same-sex acts have been decriminalised in Singapore, however the law does not recognise same sex partners or marriage, including how Singapore deals with same-sex partners under its visa and immigration policies.
* If you are or have been a Singaporean Permanent Resident or a dual Australian Singaporean citizen under the age of 21, know your obligations regarding National Service requirements before deciding to travel to, transit through, or live in Singapore.
