## Overview

### Safety

* Violent crime against tourists is rare. Petty crime, such as theft and pickpocketing, can occur at the airport, in tourist areas and on public transport. Safeguard your belongings.
* Scammers call or send text messages and pretend to be local government officials, banks or telcos. They try to obtain your personal information. Hang up immediately if the caller cannot identify themselves correctly. Delete texts quickly. Verify first by going to official websites or calling the company's hotline.
* Scammers pretend to be landlords on property websites and offer fake rental properties. Research the property and landlord before agreeing to a property rental or sale contract.
* Terrorism is a possible threat. Perpetrators may be self-radicalised individuals. Potential targets include businesses and public areas popular with foreigners. Take official warnings seriously.
* Strong winds and heavy rain can occur during the monsoon seasons from December to March and June to September. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local officials.
* Unauthorised public demonstrations are illegal. You need a police permit for any public gatherings, even if you're the only one demonstrating or protesting. Public demonstrations are only allowed at Speakers Corner in Hong Lim Park. If you're not a permanent resident, you need a police permit to join these.

### Health

* The standard of medical facilities and care is similar to or higher than in Australia. The cost is much higher, and payment may be required upfront. Ensure your travel insurance covers medical costs.
* Bringing personal medication may require approval, even in transit. If in doubt, check and seek approval with the Singapore [Health Sciences Authority](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/personal-medication/overview#:~:text=You%20may%20need%20to%20apply,be%20prosecuted%20under%20Singapore%20law.).
* Dengue fever is endemic in Singapore. The number of reported cases remains high. Follow the [National Environment Agency](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue/dengue-cases) advice to mitigate the risk of transmission.
* Zika virus is a risk. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor. Other insect-borne diseases include chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.
* Smoke haze may occur from June to October. The [National Environment Agency](http://www.nea.gov.sg/) gives updates and health warnings.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia. It's illegal to have drugs in your system. Penalties for the use and possession of drugs include caning and the mandatory death sentence for some trafficking offences. It is also illegal to have drugs in your system. You can be charged for consuming drugs even if you took them outside Singapore.
* Singapore has strict laws and penalties for acts that are legal or minor offences in Australia. These include smoking in public places or restaurants, spitting, importing or chewing gum, chewing tobacco, littering and jaywalking. Charges of drink driving, theft, shoplifting, and assault have mandatory penalties, which may include time in jail. Shoplifting is a serious crime, and Australians have been jailed. We are unable to stop you going to jail.
* If you're arrested, authorities may detain you while police investigate. You can be legally detained for up to 48 hours, during which time you may not be allowed to speak with anyone, not even a lawyer or the High Commission.
* If you commit a crime in Singapore and leave before you're caught, you may be arrested and charged the next time you arrive in Singapore.
* Singapore has strict laws for 'outrage of modesty' offences or being drunk and disorderly in public. You should avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation, including inappropriate touching or language. Penalties include jail, fines and caning.
* Strict laws control alcohol, e-cigarettes and vaporisers. Importing vaporisers, including for your own use, is illegal. It's illegal to drink in public between 10.30pm and 7am or in Liquor Control Zones.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph official buildings where there are signs banning photos.
* Penalties are severe for crimes that affect social, racial or ethnic harmony. These include racial insults and promoting ill will and hostility between different races or classes. Apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass from the [Ministry of Manpower](https://www.mom.gov.sg/) if you want to speak publicly on racial, communal, religious or political topics.
* Same-sex acts are no longer illegal. You should be aware there are local sensitivities, and behaviour standards are conservative. Public displays of affection may offend.
* If you are or have been a Singaporean Permanent Resident or a dual Australian Singaporean citizen under the age of 21, know your obligations regarding National Service requirements before deciding to travel to, transit through, or live in Singapore.
