#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests and large gatherings can occur anywhere in South Africa at any time. Services may be disrupted. Avoid areas affected by protests, demonstrations or large public gatherings. 

South Africa is hosting the G20 in 2025. During the year there will be multiple meetings across the country which may result in increased traffic and police presence. You can access the G20 calendar [here](https://g20.org/g20-events-calendar/) to find out dates and times of meetings in South Africa.

Before you travel by road, check for any disruption on your route and use major roads where it's safe to do so. Verify that alternate routes recommended by your GPS are safe. There have been instances of travellers being rerouted by their GPS through unsafe areas. Follow the advice of local authorities. Monitor local news, radio, and social media for updates.

To protect yourself if you encounter a protest or local tension:

* monitor local media and other sources for updates, including advice on curfews imposed by authorities
* don't attempt to cross protester roadblocks, as this could provoke a violent reaction
* plan for interruptions to phone and internet services
* avoid areas affected by protests or unrest
* contact your airline or tour operator to confirm arrangements before you travel
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

If you're near a demonstration, leave if it's safe to do so.

There have been reports of protesters damaging property belonging to bystanders. Avoid taking photographs or video footage of demonstrations and protests.

#### Crime

Crime and violence are serious issues in South Africa.  
  
Crime rates in South Africa are significantly higher than in Australia and often involve weapons.  
  
Be alert. Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.  
  
Armed criminals are known to target tourist areas such as the approaches to National Parks, including Kruger and Pilanesberg. Be aware when travelling through small towns and avoid driving after dark.   
  
Police in South Africa deal with a high volume of aggravated crime, and their resources are stretched. You may not get the level of service you would in Australia, especially for less serious crimes such as theft and fraud.  
  
The South African Police Service doesn't have a 'Tourist Police' force. Criminals have posed as 'Tourist Police' to extort and rob tourists, including stopping tourist buses to check proof of identity and search luggage.

#### Crime at airports

Crime in and around airports can occur.

Criminals have robbed arriving passengers, following them from the airport to:

* ATMs
* foreign currency exchange facilities
* tourist accommodation

Theft from luggage also occurs. To avoid this, don't place valuables in checked-in luggage. Consider locking your bags or using baggage wrapping services. 

#### Police officer impersonation

Criminals may pose as police officers to extort or rob you. You may also be at risk of being kidnapped. Criminals use ‘flashing blue lights’ on plain vehicles and fake IDs to stop you or force you out of the vehicle.

Do not get out of your vehicle and always ask and carefully check identification.

If you’re suspicious, do not stop and continue to a place of safety.

For more information see the 'Kidnapping' section under '[Safety](#Safety)'.

#### Other crimes

Crime in South Africa includes:

* murder
* rape
* [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* food and drink spiking
* [mugging, robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) and theft, sometimes with weapons and violence
* carjacking

Robberies involving violence can occur at shopping centres. South Africa experiences more crime during power cuts (load-shedding), including at shopping centres. Be alert at all times.

Assaults and robberies on local commuter and metro trains happen:

* between Johannesburg and Pretoria
* in Cape Town

Theft from hotel rooms and guest houses does happen, including within game parks.

Criminals have stolen phones, bags and backpacks from public places, including restaurants and bars. Be alert in all public spaces.

To avoid theft:

* don't leave luggage and valuables unattended
* place your luggage and valuables in safekeeping facilities

Crime rates are significantly higher after dark.

To protect yourself against crime, avoid travelling to:

* central business districts
* townships, unless with an organised tour run by a reputable company
* isolated beaches, lookouts and picnic areas

#### Crime involving vehicles

Thieves posing as vendors or beggars target cars:

* on highways off-ramps
* at intersections
* at traffic lights

'Smash and grab' thefts from vehicles and carjacking are common, particularly:

* on major routes
* at major intersections
* during traffic congestion
* after dark

Cash-in-transit attacks target armoured courier vans, sometimes using automatic weapons, creating a significant risk of death or serious injury to anyone nearby. Avoid driving alongside, parking next to, or being a pedestrian next to cash drops at banks and other venues.

Criminals also place debris on roads to stop vehicles. Don't stop to clear debris.

Road spiking occurs on South African roads, where criminals place spikes on roads to damage vehicles and force motorists to pull over.

To prevent theft when travelling by car:

* keep doors locked and windows up, even when driving
* keep valuables out of sight
* avoid driving after dark
* maintain situational awareness and stop at designated areas such as petrol stations
* if followed by a suspicious vehicle, go to a police station, petrol station or alert a security company

#### Attacks against hikers

There have been a number of attacks against hikers by criminals on hiking trails and in national parks and reserves. These have included, but are not limited to, Lions Head, Signal Hill and Table Mountain near Cape Town.

To prevent attacks when hiking:

* hike in groups
* advise friends, family or your accommodation provider where you are hiking and how long for
* be alert to your surroundings and circumstances.

#### Crime involving cash and credit cards

Fraud and attempted fraud are common in South Africa. Do not give your personal or financial information to anyone.

Be alert to your surroundings when using ATMs.

To protect yourself against cash and credit card crime:

* Do not use ATMs that look damaged or defective.
* Only use ATMs located in controlled areas (banks, service stations, shopping centres)
* Refuse offers of help at ATMs
* Keep all ATM and credit card payment slips secure and check for unauthorised transactions on your account statements.
* Only withdraw small amounts of cash at ATMs

Criminals use skimming devices to copy your card details onto a blank card.

Criminals use spotters to identify victims who have withdrawn cash or made expensive purchases.  

#### Scams

Scams are common. Previous victims, including Australians, have been blackmailed or found themselves facing legal action.

Scams can be online or in person and include:

* Confidence scams
* Cyber and Internet scams
* Criminal scams (police impersonation)
* Business or job opportunities
* Visa services
* Romance, friendship, dating and marriage scams (including through dating applications and social media). Learn more about these cams on [ScamWatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/online-dating-and-romance-scams).

Don't be fooled by scams. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.

Someone you meet online may ask you to send money so they can travel to Australia to visit you. As soon as the scammer receives the money, they end their relationship with you.

Some may ask you to travel to Africa to meet them. When you arrive in Africa, they may kidnap, assault or rob you.

If you're a scam victim, don't travel to South Africa to try and get your money back. There's a high risk of you being kidnapped, assaulted or robbed.

Report fraud and scams to the Commercial Crimes Unit of the South African Police Service in Johannesburg on +27 (12) 743 0148 or +27 (11) 220 4052

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### Power shortages and power cuts (load-shedding)

Unplanned power cuts (load shedding) occur throughout South Africa, which can affect private residences, businesses, municipal lighting, traffic lights, and hotels.

Power cuts can also affect water availability, internet connectivity, mobile phone network coverage, fuel availability, residential security features, and food supply.

Be prepared for issues that may arise from power cuts:

* have a communications plan for when there is no or limited power (landline locations, external mobile phone battery/power banks, additional charging cords, hard copies of important numbers).
* maintain several days’ worth of non-perishable food, drinking water, and other essential items, including medicine and first aid supplies.
* store torches, batteries, radios and basic tools in quick-access locations.
* identify safe areas around the city, including hotels, hospitals or police stations that may not lose power.
* monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. An attack could happen anywhere and at any time.

* Consider likely terrorist targets and the level of security provided, including places visited by foreigners, such as shopping centres.
* Always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.
* Report any suspicious items or activities to the police.

To reduce your risks:

* take official warnings seriously
* monitor the media for threats
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnappings can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There's a threat of kidnapping across South Africa. Foreigners have been kidnapped in the past. Kidnappings are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. Scammers may kidnap you to seek a ransom for your release.

Express kidnappings happen in South Africa, particularly in Gauteng province; anyone can be targeted. Criminals may kidnap or threaten you to force you to withdraw large amounts of money from ATMs or banking applications on your phone.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of being kidnapped: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* don’t display money or valuables in public
* use ATMs inside banks, hotels and shopping centres and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services
* stay indoors until your taxi or ride share has arrived and confirm registration and driver identity before you get in

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

See the 'Crime' section under '[Safety](#Safety)' for more details.
