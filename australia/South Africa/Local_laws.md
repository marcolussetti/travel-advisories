# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're detained or arrested, you need to ask officials to tell the Australian High Commission in Pretoria.

#### Dual citizenship

You can't enter or exit South Africa on an Australian passport if you're an Australian-South African dual national.

If you try, you may be:

* fined
* turned away from border points
* jailed for up to 12 months

Following legal judgements in 2024 relating to South Africa’s laws on dual nationality, we recommend that you visit the [South African Department of Home Affairs website](https://www.dha.gov.za/) or contact your nearest [South African embassy or consulate](https://dirco.gov.za/south-african-representation-abroad/) to confirm your citizenship status, as you may not be permitted to enter South Africa on your Australian passport.
