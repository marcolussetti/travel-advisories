## Overview

### Safety

* South Africa is hosting the G20 in 2025. During the year there will be multiple meetings across the country, which may result in increased traffic and police presence.
* Protests and large gatherings can occur anywhere in South Africa at any time. Avoid protests and demonstrations. Use major roads where it's safe to do so and verify that alternate routes recommended by your GPS are safe before travel. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Crime and violence are serious issues across South Africa, including murder, rape, assault, food and drink spiking, robbery and carjacking. South Africa experiences more crime during its power cuts (load shedding), but crime can occur anytime, anywhere. Be particularly alert in major city centres and township areas and when travelling after dark. Crimes in South Africa often involve the use of weapons. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying).
* There's a threat of kidnapping across South Africa. Pay attention to your personal security.
* Terrorism is a threat worldwide and can occur anywhere at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Opportunistic criminals also target travellers at the approaches to Kruger National Park, including Numbi Gate, and at the Lebombo/Komatipoort border. Criminals have also been targeting tourist vehicles at the approaches to Pilanesberg National Park and Sun City Resort.
* Criminals target travellers and their bags at airports and on public transport. Vehicles parked or stopped at intersections are also targeted for 'smash and grab' thefts, armed robbery and hijacking. Criminals have posed as fake tourist police to extort and rob tourists.
* ATM and credit card fraud are common. Criminals wait near ATMs to rob or identify and follow people who have withdrawn cash to rob elsewhere. Be aware of your surroundings and only withdraw small amounts of cash.
* Respect local wildlife laws. Only use professional guides or tour operators. Follow park regulations and advice from wardens. Don't swim in lakes and rivers due to the risk of wildlife attacks and disease.

* Malaria and other insect-borne diseases, such as filariasis, are common. Make sure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* You must present a yellow fever vaccination certificate if you're over one year old and travelling from a country where yellow fever is widespread, including transiting through an airport for more than 12 hours.

### Travel

* You may not be allowed to enter or exit South Africa on an Australian passport if you're an Australian-South African dual national (see 'Full advice/Dual citizenship').
* If travelling from other Southern African countries to South Africa, you'll need at least two blank pages in your passport.
* Major routes can be subject to protest activities, often with little or no warning. Exercise caution and stay informed when planning travel and driving.
* Before you travel by road, check for any disruption on your route. Use major roads where it's safe to do so and verify that alternate routes recommended by your GPS are safe. There have been instances of travellers being rerouted by their GPS through unsafe areas.
