#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You don't need a visa if you're visiting South Africa for tourism purposes for up to 90 days. In other cases, you'll need a visa.

Leaving and re-entering South Africa won't automatically give you another 90 days.

Check South Africa's immigration rules about:

* overstaying visas
* working in or migrating to South Africa
* changing your visa status
* extending your visa by travelling to a neighbouring country and attempting to return

**More information:**

* [South African Department of Home Affairs](http://www.dha.gov.za/)

#### Other formalities

South African dual nationals can’t enter or leave South Africa with a foreign passport. See [Laws](#local-laws)

South African authorities:

* don't accept [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents)
* do accept Australian emergency passports

#### Travel with children

Children travelling on a valid passport with one or both parents are no longer required to present a birth certificate, parental consent letter and other supporting documentation. However, this is still required for other situations, including unaccompanied minors (under the age of 18) travelling, legal guardianship or for dual nationals travelling on their South African passport (see the Dual Citizenship section for more information).

To check the requirements for other situations, such as legal guardianship, unaccompanied travelling minors or for dual nationals travelling on their South African passport, visit the South African Department of Home Affairs website.

#### Passport

If travelling from other Southern African countries to South Africa, make sure you have at least two blank pages in your passport.

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Your passport must have at least 2 completely blank pages to endorse your entry permit on.

If your passport doesn't comply with these requirements, authorities may stop you from boarding.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

Carry copies of a recent passport photo with you. You may need to replace your passport while you're overseas.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

There are limits to how much money you can bring into South Africa. Foreign nationals can enter with a maximum of either:

* 25,000 Rand (ZAR)
* $US10,000
* foreign currency equivalent to $US10,000

You may have to declare the amount of money you're carrying when you arrive or leave.

#### Local travel

#### Power shortages and planned power cuts (load shedding)

Planned power cuts (load shedding) occur throughout South Africa, affecting traffic lights and causing road congestion and delays. They may also affect other modes of travel, such as air and rail travel. Check with your airline or travel provider.

#### Public transport

Avoid using minibus taxis. Ask your accommodation host or tour guide for advice about using public transport.

Book local transport through a reputable provider.

#### Taxis and rideshare services

Tensions between metered taxis and rideshare drivers can escalate to violence.

Be careful:

* around train stations
* when travelling to and from airports

Avoid catching a rideshare service that is close to a metered taxi.

#### Driving permit

To drive in South Africa, you must:

* have a valid Australian driver's licence, and
* be at least 18 years of age

Driving without the correct licence can affect your insurance.

If you move to South Africa, you can swap your Australian driver's licence for a South African licence. You must do so within the first 12 months of your residency. Contact the issuing road authority if you're requested to obtain a verification of your driver's licence to convert your licence.

If you're going to ride a motorcycle, check whether your travel insurance policy covers you. Always wear a helmet.

Use extreme caution on roads.

#### Road travel

Before you travel by road, check for any disruption on your route and use major roads where it's safe to do so. Verify that alternate routes recommended by your GPS are safe using verified sources. Monitor local news, radio, and social media for updates. There have been instances of travellers being rerouted by their GPS through unsafe areas. Follow the advice of local authorities. 

Road conditions are generally good but can vary, especially in rural areas.

Hazards in urban and rural areas include:

* excessive speed
* poor driving skills
* difficult conditions
* pedestrians and animals straying onto roads, especially at night
* drunk driving, especially at night

People have been attacked travelling on alternate and secondary roads to Cape Town International Airport. When travelling to or from the Cape Town International Airport:

* remain on the M2 or N2 highways if safe to do so
* avoid detours through Borchard’s Quarry Road leading to Nyanga
* Airport transfers are available

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in South Africa than in Australia.
