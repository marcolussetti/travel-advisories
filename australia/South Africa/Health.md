#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you bring restricted medication or don't have the right documents, you could:

* be arrested
* have your medication confiscated

This includes countries where you don't leave the airport.

If you intend to bring medicine, check if:

* it's legal
* there's a limit on how much you can take
* whether you need any certifications

If your medication is illegal in South Africa, ask your doctor in Australia about alternatives.

Take enough legal medicine so you remain in good health on your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Yellow fever

If you're travelling from a country where yellow fever is widespread, you'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter South Africa. This doesn't apply to a child aged under 1 year.

If you can't show proof of vaccination, authorities may not let you enter.

You can't get vaccinated when you arrive.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection in South Africa is very high.

Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

Victims of violent crime, especially rape, should seek immediate medical help.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is present in parts of South Africa, especially:

* remote areas in the far north
* remote areas in the east
* Kruger National Park

The 90km area along the border with Mozambique and Zimbabwe is a designated malaria risk zone. Some areas nearby may have a malaria risk during the year.

Other insect-borne diseases, including [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis), are also prevalent.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Take medicine to prevent malaria if travelling to an area where it's common.

#### Cholera

[Cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) mainly occurs in rural areas. More serious outbreaks can happen from time to time.

To protect yourself against cholera:

* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* be strict with your hygiene habits if you travel in rural areas
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids

Tap water in major cities is generally safe to drink.

#### Other infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are prevalent.

There are ongoing cases of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa, including in South Africa. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with infected people, animals (especially primates and rodents) and items that may have come into contact with them.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in South Africa varies.

Public medical facilities are generally low standard compared with Australia. Private hospitals are often better equipped.

Many regional hospitals only provide basic facilities.

There's no shared healthcare agreement between Australia and South Africa.

Before admitting you, hospitals usually ask for:

* confirmation of medical insurance
* up-front deposit for services
* public hospitals will treat foreigners for free, but the level of care varies.

In remote areas, air evacuation to a major city is sometimes the only option in an emergency. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Decompression chambers are located at:

* St Augustine's Hospital, Durban
* Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg
* Eugene Marais Hospital, Pretoria
