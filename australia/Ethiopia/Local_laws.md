# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Death penalty

Ethiopia applies the death penalty for serious offences, including aggravated murder.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail sentences and heavy fines.

#### Other laws

Family law in Ethiopia can differ a lot from Australian law. This includes divorce, child custody and child support. Laws affecting business activities can also be very different.

Get professional advice on your rights and responsibilities if you're engaging in business or family-related matters.

You should comply with the law, including on carrying identification documents at all times, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.

If you're in an accident, it's illegal to move your vehicle before a police officer arrives.

If you’re arrested the Government of Ethiopia may not tell the Australian Government. Authorities may not permit Australian Embassy staff to visit you.

Same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Ethiopia. If found guilty you could face up to 15 years imprisonment.

In Ethiopia, it's also illegal to:

* buy or remove Ethiopian antiquities, animal skins or other cultural artefacts, including some Ethiopian crosses, without a permit
* export precious stones and minerals beyond prescribed limits for personal use — check with local authorities before you buy
* own ivory
* give money to or buy something from a beggar or vendor in traffic

Ethiopia doesn't recognise dual nationality.

Despite this, if you’re of Ethiopian heritage and you’re arrested, the Government of Ethiopia may not tell the Australian Government. Authorities may not permit Australian Embassy staff to visit you.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://smartraveller.gov.au/our-services/passport-services).

Standards of behaviour and dress are conservative in Ethiopia. Take care not to offend.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Time and calendar differences
