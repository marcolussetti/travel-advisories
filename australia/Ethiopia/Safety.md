# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Ethiopia is dynamic and can deteriorate without warning. Travellers should monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

The Amhara militia (Fano) is active in several areas of Amhara Regional State. The risk of civil unrest and armed conflict is higher in some areas, particularly in Amhara, Oromia, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela Regional States, and along international borders, except the border shared with Djibouti. We continue to advise against travel to these areas due to the volatile security situation.

Low-level political and ethnic disputes are common across many parts of Ethiopia, including along intra-regional borders. Disputes can turn violent. While foreigners have not been targeted, you should remain alert to the risk.

Security measures, including curfews and movement restrictions, may be implemented in Ethiopia at short notice. Roads can be closed at any time and communications may be disrupted or unreliable. Restrictions may change rapidly and without warning and can impact the Embassy's ability to provide consular support to Australians.

International events and political changes can trigger demonstrations. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid crowds or protests.

If, despite our advice, you travel to 'Do not travel' areas of Ethiopia, you should:

* ensure that your travel documents are up to date and readily accessible to you
* have a contingency plan in place if you need to leave quickly
* monitor local media for information on the evolving situation
* expect a heightened security presence
* stop at all checkpoints and roadblocks
* you should comply with the law, including those relating to carrying identification documents at all times, foreign currency limits and possession of weapons
* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide, including in Ethiopia. Terror attacks could happen at any time with little or no warning. These include in commercial and public venues that foreigners visit in Ethiopia. You’re strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance.

Terrorists may use events such as international meetings or days of national or religious significance to mount attacks.

Large crowds are common on key national and religious dates.

Possible targets for terror attacks include:

* clubs, hotels, resorts, restaurants and bars
* schools, places of worship, embassies and government buildings
* landmarks, tourist areas, markets, shopping centres and malls
* political and sporting events
* outdoor recreation events and public gatherings, including large religious festivals and concerts
* aircraft and airports
* petrol stations
* buses and bus terminals
* railways and other transport infrastructure

Some local hotels have received bomb threats in the past.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* avoid the kinds of public places known to be terrorist targets
* have an exit plan if there's a security incident
* be alert in the lead up to, and on days of, national or religious significance
* monitor the news for any emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow instructions from local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped while travelling overseas. Kidnapping can occur anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are usually considered lower risk.

Several active terrorist and militia groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners. The threat of kidnapping is particularly high in some parts of Amhara and Oromia Regional States, and near the border areas with Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan. Aid and humanitarian workers may be targeted

If despite our advice you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, you should be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Border areas

Cross-border violence is common and can occur at any time.

Do not travel to the following border areas of Ethiopia due to the risk of terrorism, [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping"), armed conflict, violent crime, and landmines:

* Within 10km of the border with Eritrea
* Within 20km of the border with Sudan
* Within 10km of the border with South Sudan
* Withing 10km of the border with Kenya
* Within 100km of the border with Somalia (excluding the Fafan Zone of Somali Regional State, which is within 40km).

#### Crime

Unprovoked violent [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") can occur, including in popular tourist areas in Addis Ababa. Avoid walking at night.

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), visit a doctor as soon as possible.

Keep an eye on local information sources about crime. Always be aware of your surroundings and pay close attention to your belongings.

Petty crime is increasingly common, particularly in Addis Ababa. Foreigners are often targeted. Petty crime includes:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* jewellery theft
* thefts from vehicles stopped at traffic lights

Petty crimes often take place in crowded areas, particularly in Addis Ababa, including:

* the Mercato open air market
* tourist spots including areas around Bole, Piazza and Meskel Square

These crimes are often carried out by groups of children. Some robbery victims have been assaulted.

Keep your car windows and doors closed and locked at all times, including when moving.

Don’t leave valuables in your car.

Highway robberies and armed carjackings have been reported outside the main urban centres.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
