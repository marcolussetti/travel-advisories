#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

You must have a visa to enter Ethiopia. Visa applications must be made [online](https://www.evisa.gov.et/#/home). 

#### Visa conditions

Check your visa expiration date. If you stay beyond the expiry date, you will have to pay a daily fine. You will not be allowed to leave Ethiopia until you pay the immigration fines, which you must pay using USD cash. This also applies if your resident ID has expired.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid [yellow fever vaccination certificate](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) to enter Ethiopia. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave. You should carry a valid Yellow Fiver International Vaccination Certificate.

#### Banned or restricted items

Satellite phones, drones and binoculars cannot be imported to Ethiopia without prior approval. Seek advice from your travel provider on permissions required. Unapproved items may be confiscated by authorities.

There are no guidelines covering the use of drones in Ethiopia. They may be confiscated at airports or at the border. Seek and carry written permission from the Ethiopian Government before using drones.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB).

Currency controls are strict in Ethiopia. If you have more than USD3,000 or the same amount in another foreign currency, you must declare it when you arrive and depart. You may be required to show receipts to demonstrate expenditure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. You are unable to depart Ethiopia with more than ETB2,000 in cash.

If you arrive or depart with more than USD3,000, the entire amount in your possession can be seized by authorities.

It's difficult to exchange Australian dollars in Ethiopia. However, most banks exchange US dollars.

There are ATMs in major Ethiopian cities. ATMs can't always be used for cash advances and can run out of cash unexpectedly. Always travel with ETB.

Credit cards are accepted at major hotels and an increasing number of other outlets, mostly in Addis Ababa. Poor power supply and internet outages may affect their reliable operation.  Consider carrying a backup supply of cash.  

Check with your bank to make sure your card will work in Ethiopia.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Landmines are a hazard in the border areas with Eritrea, Sudan and Somalia. If you travel near these borders despite our advice, stick to well-travelled roads (see [Safety).](#safety)

#### Driving permit

If you want to drive in Ethiopia, you can apply to convert a valid Australian licence to a local one. It's an Ethiopian Government requirement that your Australian license first be authenticated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia and then by the Australian Embassy in Ethiopia for it to be recognised. See the [Ethiopian Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/66) for more information.

International driving permits aren't recognised in Ethiopia.

#### Road travel

Driving in Ethiopia can be dangerous because of:

* poor road conditions
* poorly maintained vehicles
* local driving practices
* poor lighting
* people and animals, particularly camels, wandering on roads

Security forces sometimes close roads, including highways. Closures can occur without notice.

Due to the dynamic security situation, we advise against road travel outside major cities in Ethiopia.

#### Car accidents

Drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including prison and fines.

If you're in a car accident, it's illegal to move your vehicle before a police officer arrives. However, if you feel unsafe, leave the area immediately and report to the nearest police station.

If you plan to drive in Ethiopia:

* become familiar with local traffic laws and practices before driving
* drive legally
* don't drink and drive
* keep your car windows and doors closed and locked at all times, including when moving
* avoid driving at night, where possible

If you're stopped by police, follow their instructions.

If rocks are thrown at your car, leave the area as quickly and safely as possible.

To protect yourself when travelling outside Addis Ababa:

* get local advice on road and security conditions along your planned route before you travel
* leave details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person
* travel in a group where possible
* carry a well-stocked medical pack
* consider carrying a satellite phone — regular telephones, including the mobile network, are unreliable

#### Motorcycles

Check with your insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike or similar vehicle. Your policy may not cover accidents that occur while using these vehicles.

Always wear a helmet. Make sure your passenger does too.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis. Arrange these through your hotel or an app-based booking service such as RIDE or Feres. Avoid flagging down taxis in the street.

Consider sitting in the back seat rather than the front.

Not all taxis are metered. Ensure the meter is on or agree on the fare before you leave.

#### Public transport

Ethiopia has limited bus and rail services. However, safety standards aren't the same as in Australia. Buses have been attacked outside Addis Ababa.

Petty crime occurs on public transport. Take care of your belongings when travelling on buses, trams and trains.
