## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in Ethiopia is dynamic and could deteriorate without warning. Roads can be closed at any time and communications may not be reliable. We advise against all road travel outside of major cities.
* Ethiopia’s borders with Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Sudan are high-risk areas. If, despite our advice, you plan to travel to these areas, get professional security advice.
* There's a threat of terrorism across Ethiopia. Attacks could occur with little or no warning. Possible targets include hotels, markets, places of worship, government buildings, transport hubs and aircraft. Avoid possible targets, be alert on days of national significance, and maintain a high level of vigilance.
* The threat of kidnapping is particularly high in some parts of Amhara and Oromia Regional States, and near the border areas with Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan. Aid and humanitarian workers may be targeted. Several active terrorist groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners.
* Petty crime, particularly pickpocketing, is common in Addis Ababa. Foreigners may be targets. Be vigilant in all areas, particularly around Meskel Square, Mercato market, Hyatt Regency, Hilton and Sheraton hotels, Yeka Hills, Entoto, and Bole. Violent assault can occur and is more common after dark. Don't walk at night.
* Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.
* Earthquakes and volcanic activity can affect parts of Ethiopia. In January 2025, Ethiopian authorities began evacuating people from Mount Dofan in Awash National Park due to increased volcanic activity.

### Health

* Health facilities are limited in Addis Ababa. Only private hospitals offer a reasonable standard of basic care. Ambulance services are limited. You can contact the Australian Embassy in Addis Ababa for a list of known medical providers.
* In rural areas, health facilities are inadequate. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation out of the country. Ensure your health insurance covers this. The availability and timeliness of medical evacuation services may be affected.
* Yellow fever is widespread in Ethiopia. Get vaccinated before you travel. Malaria is present everywhere in Ethiopia except Addis Ababa and areas above 2000m. Consider taking anti-malarial medication when travelling outside of these areas.
* Water and food-borne diseases are common. Drink only boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids. Avoid ice cubes, raw, and undercooked food.
* Altitude sickness is a risk in several parts of Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa (2,400m above sea level). Travellers should be alert to symptoms and take necessary precautions.

### Local laws

* You should comply with the law, including on carrying identification documents at all times, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities.
* Ethiopian laws can be quite different from Australia and penalties may appear harsh by Australian standards. Get professional advice if you're involved in legal matters.
* If you're in a road accident, don't move your vehicle before a police officer arrives. It's illegal to do so.
* Understand and follow local laws. It's illegal to buy or remove cultural artefacts without a permit, or export certain amounts of precious stones. It's also illegal to own ivory or to interact with beggars or vendors in traffic.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph the Presidential Palace, military sites and military personnel.
* Same-sex sexual acts are illegal. If found guilty you could face up to 15 years imprisonment.
* Ethiopia has conservative dress and behaviour standards.

### Travel

* We continue to advise reconsider your need to travel to Ethiopia and also advise do not travel to some locations. The security situation is dynamic.
* You must have a visa to enter Ethiopia. Visa applications must be made [online](https://www.evisa.gov.et/#/home). Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Ethiopia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/66) for the latest details.
* The official currency is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB). You can exchange US dollars at the international airport, major banks and hotels. It's difficult to change Australian dollars. ATMs issue small amounts of local currency. In Addis Ababa large hotels, restaurants and large shops accept credit cards. Outside of Addis Ababa, credit card and ATM facilities are limited. Have multiple ways to access money.
