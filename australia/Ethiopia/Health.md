#### Travel insurance

If you travel to Ethiopia, check you have appropriate [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance). If you plan to travel to ‘Do not travel’ parts of Ethiopia, you'll likely need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Ethiopia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor saying:

* what the medications are
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

**Insect-borne diseases**

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in Ethiopia. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel and carry your vaccination card. Some countries require you to present your Yellow Fever vaccination card if you have travelled in Ethiopia.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is widespread in Ethiopia except for the capital Addis Ababa and areas above 2000m. Chloroquine-resistant strains are reported in some areas. Consider taking medication to prevent chloroquine-resistant malaria.

Other insect-borne diseases include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

[Bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis) and other waterborne diseases are spread through freshwater lakes and rivers.

* avoid wading through flood waters and waterways

#### Polio

Ethiopia is vulnerable to international spread of the wild [poliovirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1).

Stay up to date with recommended polio vaccinations, including a booster dose, through the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/).

#### Altitude sickness

The altitude in the mountain regions of Ethiopia, including in the capital city of Addis Ababa, can cause problems. People with lung, heart or chest problems should take extra care. Even if you're healthy, you can still be affected.

Symptoms of altitude sickness include:

* headache
* dizziness
* vomiting
* coordination problems

In severe cases, fluid can build up in your lungs, brain or both, which can be fatal.

To protect yourself from altitude sickness:

* ascend slowly, especially above an altitude of 2500m
* rest when needed and don't push your body
* avoid alcohol and cigarettes

If you're affected by severe altitude sickness, get to lower ground as soon as possible.

#### Medical care

Health facilities are limited in Addis Ababa and inadequate in rural areas. Only private hospitals offer a reasonable standard of basic care.

Health facilities are inadequate in rural areas. Travellers should consider carrying a first aid kit when travelling outside of Addis Ababa.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
