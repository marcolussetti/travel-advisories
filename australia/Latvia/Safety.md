#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, particularly in Riga Old Town. This can include:

* bag snatching

* [muggings](/node/344)

Hotspots for pickpockets include:

* central train and bus stations
* Riga Central Market
* parks
* routes to major hotels

Pickpockets usually operate in groups.

#### Drink spiking

Criminals may spike drinks in bars and casinos.

To protect yourself from spiking:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* don't leave your food or drink unattended

#### Scams and fraud

Reports of tourists being overcharged for drinks at restaurants and tourist pubs have declined. However, check drink prices before you order.

Credit card [scams](/node/363) occur in places popular with tourists, such as:

* shops
* restaurants
* bars
* nightclubs

Always keep your card in sight. Don't sign blank credit card slips.

Internet crime also happens, including online dating and financial scams.

#### Road-based crime

Car theft is common, particularly in Riga.

To protect yourself:

* use secure and well-lit car parks
* don't leave valuables in a vehicle

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

The security environment at the Belarusian border could deteriorate at short notice. If you're in these areas, carry ID with you at all times and follow the advice of local authorities.

Civil unrest is uncommon.

However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

If you're in an area where protests have happened:
