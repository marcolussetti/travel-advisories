#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime may occur, particularly in Riga Old Town and during tourist seasons. This can include:

* bag snatching

Hotspots for pickpockets include:

* central train and bus stations
* Riga Central Market

Pickpockets usually operate in groups.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Criminals may spike drinks in bars and casinos. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

Credit card [scams](/node/363) occur in places popular with tourists, such as:

* restaurants
* bars

Always keep your card in sight.

Internet crime also happens, including online dating and financial scams.

#### Road-based crime

Car theft may occur, particularly in Riga.

To protect yourself:

* use secure and well-lit car parks
* don't leave valuables in a vehicle

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

The security environment at the Belarusian border could deteriorate at short notice. If you're in these areas, carry ID with you at all times and follow the advice of local authorities. Areas close to the border are restricted.

#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have staged attacks in several European cities. The Latvian State Security Service assesses Latvia's terrorist threat level as low.

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.
