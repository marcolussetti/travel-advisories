# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties are severe for drug offences, including for possessing small amounts of drugs. Penalties may include long jail terms and heavy fines.

* [Carrying or using drugs](/node/103)
* [Partying safely](/node/365)

#### Other laws

You can't drink alcohol in a public place unless it's in a designated area. Authorities often issue fines to people for walking with open beer or wine containers.

Authorities also strictly control the export of:

* religious materials
* antiques

If you're in doubt, check with local authorities. Before you buy an item, ask authorities whether you're allowed to export it.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
