## Overview

### Safety

* The security environment at the Belarusian border could deteriorate at short notice. If you're in these areas, carry ID with you at all times and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Petty crime may occur, particularly in Riga. This includes bag snatching, pickpocketing and muggings. Hotspots include Old Town, the central train and bus stations, the Central Market, parks, and routes to major hotels. Take care of your belongings.
* Check the price of drinks before ordering. Tourists are sometimes overcharged. Credit card fraud may occur in some bars and nightclubs later at night. Watch your card during transactions. Don't sign blank credit card slips.
* Criminals may spike drinks in bars, nightclubs, and casinos. Don't leave your drinks unattended.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

### Health

* Public medical facilities are good in larger cities but more limited in rural areas. Private facilities are of a similar standard to those in Australia. You may need to pay up-front.
* If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
