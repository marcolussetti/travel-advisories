#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs. If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call emergency services on 112, and for emergency consular assistance, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Latvia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) and other tick-borne diseases are a risk in forest areas. Prior vaccination is recommended.

Ticks are active from spring to autumn: March to November.

To protect yourself from disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* check your body for ticks during and after forest visits

If a tick bites you:

* remove it from your body as soon as possible
* make sure you remove the whole tick. If possible, keep the tick for diagnosis.
* monitor the site for signs of infection

#### Other health risks

* [Hepatitis A](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-a)
* [Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/node/348) can also occur. Water contamination may be a problem in rural areas.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil all drinking water or drink bottled water with intact seals
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Seek medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

In large cities, the standard of public medical facilities is good. However, in rural areas, public medical facilities may be more limited. English is spoken in many places.

Most private medical facilities are well-equipped. Services are of a similar standard to those in Australia.

You may need to pay doctors and hospitals upfront before they treat you. Payments can be made by credit card or internet bank transfer.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to evacuate to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
