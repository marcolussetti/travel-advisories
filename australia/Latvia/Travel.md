#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Latvia is part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") with many other European countries. This means you can enter Latvia without a visa in some cases.

In other situations, you'll need to get a visa.

When you first enter the Schengen Area, get an entry stamp in your passport from border control staff.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [embassy or consulate of Latvia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/110) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

To enter Latvia, you must have a valid health insurance policy. Your cover must include any health-related expenses during your stay, including the cost of flying you home. If you don't have adequate insurance, authorities may ask you to buy a policy when you arrive.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [embassy or consulate of Latvia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/110) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Authorities may ask you to verify your identity while you're in Latvia. Always carry:

* your passport
* your Latvian residency permit, if you have one

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Euro.

Latvia is a member of the European Union (EU). If you're travelling between Latvia and any non-EU country, you must declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll have to pay a fine when you enter or leave Latvia if you:

* don't declare this money
* give incorrect information

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling between EU countries.

#### Local travel

#### Border areas

Some land borders between Latvia and Russia/Belarus remain open for those travelling by car, except for vehicles registered in Russia or Belarus, carrying Russian or Belarusian license plates. These vehicles will be refused entry into Latvia. The situation may change with little notice, including which crossing points remain open. 

No passenger rail options are currently running between Russia/Belarus and Latvia.

You must comply with Latvian border rules and requirements.

Expect increased wait time and delays at the border with [Russia](/destinations/europe/russia "Russia"). Visit the [Border Guard](https://www.transport.lv/en/) website for the latest information on border crossings.

#### International Driving Permit

If you plan to drive in Latvia, you are required to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP). Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* icy roads and low visibility in winter
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* dimly lit roads

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Latvia than in Australia.

Learn the local road rules, including:

* always drive with headlights on
* fit winter tyres from around 1 December to 1 March (dates vary with weather conditions)

If you've been driving for less than 2 years, the blood alcohol limit is 0.02%. For everyone else, the limit is 0.05%.

Penalties for driving over the limit can include:

* a heavy fine
* a jail sentence
* losing your licence
* losing your vehicle permanently
