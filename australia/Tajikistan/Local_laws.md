# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Law enforcement agencies in Tajikistan cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include long prison terms in local jails.

#### Other laws

You must always carry a copy of your current passport and visa.

In Tajikistan, it's illegal to:

* drive with a blood alcohol limit of over 0%
* smoke in public places, including on the street, and smoke in private cars with children or pregnant women
* not wear seatbelts
* take artefacts or cultural items out of Tajikistan without a permit

It's also illegal to photograph sensitive sites, including:

* military zones, assets, or personnel
* transport facilities
* government buildings

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Tajikistan doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Tajik authorities may insist you enter Tajikistan on your Tajik passport. If they don't, always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Local customs

Tajikistan has conservative and traditional standards of dress and behaviour.

Public displays of affection may offend locals.

If in doubt, dress conservatively and seek local advice.

Same-sex relationships are legal in Tajikistan, but they're not widely accepted. Avoid public displays of affection.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Tajikistan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, or smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
