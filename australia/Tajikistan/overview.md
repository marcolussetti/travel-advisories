## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks have occurred in Tajikistan. In recent years, there have also been explosions in some locations, including Dushanbe. Be cautious when visiting possible terrorist targets. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Avoid travelling to the border area with Afghanistan due to the volatile security situation. It's also a transit point for drugs and other smuggled goods. If, despite our advice, your travel to this area, be alert to your surroundings at all times.
* In 2022, military clashes in the Sughd Region bordering the Kyrgyz Republic escalated into an armed conflict. Following a ceasefire agreement, the security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate further with little warning. Avoid all non-essential travel to the Tajik-Kyrgyz border area.
* Political violence has happened in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). Extra security measures are in place.
* Earthquakes, avalanches, mudslides and floods happen in Tajikistan. Closely monitor local media and other sources, like the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/). Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Some medications containing codeine are restricted in Tajikistan. If you intend to bring medication, confirm it's legal and check the rules that apply. Declare all medicines and other restricted items on arrival. If you don't, or if the amount you carry is over the legal limits, you could face charges.
* Ticks are very common in forests and country areas from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks during and after travel in forests. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Unprotected uranium and pesticide waste dumps in the northern Sughd Region may pose a health risk. Seek local advice.
* Medical facilities and services are limited in Tajikistan, and there's a shortage of equipment and medications. Hygiene is poor. Doctors require up-front payment before providing treatment.
