#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some sleeping tablets and medications containing codeine are controlled in Tajikistan.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Tajikistan. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Declare all medications and other restricted items on arrival. If you don't declare them or you're carrying amounts over the legal limit, you could face charges even if you have the required paperwork.

#### Health risks

Ticks are very common in forests and country areas. They're active from spring to autumn (March to November).

Check your body for ticks during and after travel in forests.

To protect yourself against illness:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other [infectious diseases](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/diseases) are common. They include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Tailings and pesticides

Unprotected uranium and pesticide waste dumps in the northern Sughd Region may pose a health risk.

Seek local advice.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities and services are limited in Tajikistan. Hygiene is poor, and there's a shortage of medical equipment and medications.

Doctors will ask for up-front payment before providing treatment.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you may be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

The [Australian Embassy in Moscow](http://russia.embassy.gov.au/) can give you a list of medical facilities in Tajikistan.
