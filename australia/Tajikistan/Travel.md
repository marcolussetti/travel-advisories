#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australians can enter Tajikistan under a visa-free arrangement. The arrangement covers single-entry stays of up to 30 days.

You'll still need a visa for the following:

* stays of more than 30 days
* multiple entries.

Tajik visas specify validity, the number of entries and length of stay. Check your visa details are correct when you get it.

The length of stay on your visa may differ from the length of your application.

Ensure you have the correct visa type and leave the country before your visa expires.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, customs and quarantine rules, contact:

* an [embassy or consulate of Tajikistan](http://www.tajembassy.org.uk/)
* the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan, Consular Service Section](https://www.consular.tj/visa.aspx)

#### Other formalities

#### Registration

You must register with the local authorities within 10 working days of arrival.

Hotels will only register you for the duration of your hotel stay. If you change accommodation, you will need to register again.

Travellers visiting Tajikistan for more than 90 days must do a health test.

#### Permits

You need a permit to visit Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO).

Tajik embassies and consulates issue this permit. The permit is subject to the security situation in the neighbouring regions.

Apply at the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://mfa.tj/?l=en) or Passport-Registration Service of the Ministry of Interior of Tajikistan.

#### Border crossings

Tajikistan's borders can close without notice.

Some border crossings may only be open to locals.

Ask local authorities which border crossings are open and if you can use them.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

For Tajikistan, ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months and has 2 empty pages.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Tajik Somoni (TJS). US dollars and euros are readily accepted.

You can't exchange US banknotes issued before 1996.

You'll need to declare cash amounts exceeding the equivalent 3000 USD upon exiting Tajikistan. You must provide documents confirming the origin of the money in addition to a customs declaration.

Tajik legislation about importing and exporting money and goods may change without warning. Seek advice from local authorities.

The Tajik economy is largely cash-based. Traveller's cheques aren't accepted. Very few places accept credit cards.

International banking services are limited.

You'll find several ATMs in Dushanbe and larger cities, but not in some rural areas.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Tajikistan, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia. Driving without it could void your insurance.

#### Road travel

Road conditions and driving standards are poor.

Driving at night is dangerous.

It's illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level above zero.

Police and military checkpoints are common. You may need to provide identification documents at checkpoints.

Avalanches and landslides can occur in winter and spring. Road conditions can be unpredictable during this time.

Many interior roads are open only in the summer, including the main road from Dushanbe to Khujand.

Service stations are limited in rural areas.

To stay safe when driving:

* understand local traffic laws and practices
* avoid driving at night
* ask locals for advice on road conditions
* make sure you have enough petrol when travelling in rural areas

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use licensed taxis and limousines. Arrange these through your hotel.

#### Public transport

[Public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport) in the city is often overcrowded and unsafe.

Bus services between major cities are unreliable.

#### Rail travel

Rail travel can be unreliable. It can also be dangerous due to criminal activity.

#### Air travel

Flight cancellations and delays at Dushanbe International Airport are common.

If you need to leave Tajikistan quickly, you may need valid entry visas for alternative destinations.

In 2022, the EU announced that 21 Russian-owned airlines were banned from flying in EU airspace due to safety concerns.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Tajikistan's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EY) with the Aviation Safety Network.
