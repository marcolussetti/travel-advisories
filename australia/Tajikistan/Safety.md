# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks have occurred in Tajikistan. Tajik security forces have prevented many more. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations and other public areas.

Explosions have been reported in some locations, including Dushanbe, in recent years.

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Avoid travelling to the border area with Afghanistan due to the volatile security situation. It's also a transit point for drugs and other smuggled goods. If, despite our advice, you travel to this area, always be alert to your surroundings.

In 2022, military clashes at the border between the Sughd Region of Tajikistan and the Batken region of Kyrgyz Republic escalated into an armed conflict, where more than 100 people were killed and 140 000 evacuated. Following a ceasefire agreement, the security situation remains volatile and could deteriorate further with little warning. There's also a risk from unmarked minefields. Avoid all non-essential travel to the Tajik-Kyrgyz border area.

Political violence has occurred in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). Extra security measures are in place.

You need a special permit to travel into the GBAO. See [Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/tajikistan#travel).

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings.

Monitor the media and local sources for updates about possible unrest. Avoid affected areas.

#### Crime

Pickpocketing is common in Dushanbe and on international rail services. Travellers may be targeted.

Women can be subject to verbal and physical harassment.

Criminal activity increases after dark.

Criminal groups are particularly active in Tajikistan's border regions. The region bordering Afghanistan is a transit point for drugs and other smuggled goods.

Occasional clashes occur between government forces and criminal groups, particularly in the regions bordering Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.

To protect yourself from crime:

* leave valuables in a secure location
* carry a copy of your passport and visa
* take particular care if travelling alone or at night
* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. Kidnaps have occurred along the border of Afghanistan.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.
