#### Terrorism

Terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province, are active in Cameroon. There's a high threat of attacks, particularly in the Far North Region, including near Lake Chad and the area within 40km of the borders with Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR). However, attacks could occur anywhere, including in major cities like Douala and Yaoundé.

Terrorist attacks could take place at any time or timed specifically to coincide with holidays and important events and dates. Attacks may be indiscriminate and target a wide range of places visited by foreigners or where crowds gather, such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres, sporting and cultural venues, transport hubs, places of worship, government buildings and security installations.

Attacks could include the use of explosive devices (including suicide bombers and armed drones), knives, machetes, gunfire, kidnapping or a combination of the above.  
Terrorists may target foreign nationals, including business people, workers in extractives industries, tourists, journalists and humanitarian aid workers.

To reduce your risk, stay aware of your surroundings and be alert to suspicious behaviour and items being left in public places.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
Kidnapping is a risk in Cameroon. The threat is very high in:

* the Far North Region
* South-West and North-West Regions
* The borders with Central African Republic and Nigeria

Kidnappers have also targeted foreigners in urban areas of Douala and Yaoundé.

Pirate gangs regularly attack shipping in Cameroonʼs waters and have carried out several successful maritime kidnaps there. The Bakassi peninsula, adjacent to the Nigerian border, has a history of local militancy and kidnapping  
  
If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

 The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including muggings, robberies, and attacks on motorists, occurs in urban areas and on intercity highways. Armed highwaymen operate across the country. Armed gangs have targeted restaurants and hotels frequented by foreigners.

Armed criminals and bandits are common in the border areas with the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Chad. They have been known to set up false roadblocks and ambush victims.

Stay only in accommodation with adequate security measures in place. Avoid isolated and poorer urban areas, including in Yaoundé and Douala, particularly at night and when walking alone.  When travelling by car, keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight.

If you become a victim of violent crime, including rape, seek medical help straight away. The HIV/AIDS infection rate in Cameroon is high (see '[Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/cameroon#health)').

#### Petty crime

Thieves are active on trains, coaches, buses and taxis, and around bus stations, markets and hotels. Be aware of your surroundings, especially in busy areas. Always take care of your belongings when in public and take care to not show signs of affluence, including cash, expensive watches, jewellery and electronic devices.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

Commercial and internet fraud often originates in West African countries, including Cameroon. ATM, debit and credit card fraud is also common (see 'Money').

Online scammers defraud victims. Victims who have travelled to the originating country have put their lives in danger.

Criminals often seek details of 'safe' bank accounts overseas, such as yours. They claim they will transfer large sums of money into the account. Victims believe they will get a donation, or a percentage of the amount involved.

Be aware of other scams where criminals:

* give fake cheques for 'urgent' shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for fake government contracts
* pretend to be calling from your financial institution
* extort money from people the scammers convince to travel to Africa for business opportunities
* persuade victims to pay large amounts of money for false adoption schemes - Cameroon does not have adoption agencies

To protect yourself against a scam, be wary of:

* any request to send money to a person in Cameroon
* any invitation to Cameroon to meet someone you have met over the internet

Be careful about giving out personal information or disposing of personal documents in Cameroon.

Scammers can access your personal data when you use open networks. Be careful when and where you use internet banking and other sites that transmit or store your data or passwords.

If you're travelling to Cameroon, your family and friends may receive bogus phone calls and emails from Cameroon. Scammers may claim that you're in legal, financial or medical trouble and that you need money.

Some scammers may pretend to work for the Australian High Commission in Abuja and ask you to transfer money to the High Commission. Check with the High Commission first through its official contact details if you're asked to send money or information to them (see '[Local contacts](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/nigeria#local-contacts)').

Don't travel to Cameroon to try to get your money back or seek revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Bogus dating schemes

Criminals in West Africa operate fake online friendship, dating and marriage schemes.

Scammers use these schemes to defraud and threaten the lives of Australians. They do this by targeting Australians and other foreigners on internet dating sites or chat rooms. They may pose as a prospective friend or spouse and may use a completely false identity.

Once a friendship develops, the scammer asks for money to allow them to travel to Australia. Sometimes, the scammer ends the relationship once the money has been sent. There's little chance of getting the money back.

In other cases, foreigners are lured to Africa to meet their prospective friend or marriage partner. Once in Africa, they may become the victim of kidnapping, assault, robbery or extortion.

There have also been cases of sexual extortion or '[sextortion](https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/image-based-abuse/deal-with-sextortion)', where scammers develop a fake romantic relationship and then ask to exchange revealing photographs or videos. Once they have these, the nature of the relationship will often change abruptly, and the scammers will demand payment in exchange for not releasing these items to the victim's family, friends or work colleagues.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or when using Bluetooth. 

Social media use can be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Northwest and Southwest regions

Due to conflict between Anglophone separatists and Cameroon government forces, tensions in the Northwest and Southwest (Anglophone) regions are high. There have been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups in recent years. You should avoid travelling to these regions, including the Bakassi Peninsula, due to the high threat of localised violence and kidnapping. If you do travel through these areas, monitor the local media and comply with directions by local authorities.

People have been killed and injured in armed clashes and explosions in the regional capitals of Buea and Bamenda. Armed groups are increasingly using IEDs, which have previously been used to target civilians in these regions. Serious incidents have also taken place at informal roadblocks set up by non-state groups. There's continuing potential for this civil unrest to degrade into armed conflict. Restrictions, including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, remain in place in some areas.

The Northwest and Southwest regions experience:

* general strikes, including 'ghost town Mondays' when markets and offices are closed
* telecommunications disruptions
* movement restrictions
* curfews

#### Adamaoua and East regions

Sometimes, civil unrest and armed conflict in the Central African Republic has spilled across the border into Cameroon. That conflict mostly affects outposts in the Adamaoua and East regions.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests, demonstrations and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent without warning.

Civil unrest is possible in all parts of Cameroon, not only the Northwest and Southwest regions.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings
* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

Curfews could be imposed in parts of Cameroon. Obey local authorities on all curfews and movement restrictions.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Cameroon experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), flooding and volcanic eruptions.

To protect yourself during a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family

#### Flooding

The rainy season is:

* mid-March to mid-June, then mid-September to mid-November for the central and southern regions
* mid-June to mid-September for the northern regions

Heavy rain may cause flooding and landslides, making roads impassable during these periods. Essential services may be reduced during this time. Seek local advice and monitor local media.

#### Volcanoes

Mount Cameroon is an active [volcano](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") that may experience explosions and lava flows. Ask local authorities before climbing it.

The Nyos and Monoun volcanic lakes sometimes give off toxic fumes, which have caused deaths in the past. Seek advice from local authorities before visiting.
