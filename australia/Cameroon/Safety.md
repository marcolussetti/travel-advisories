# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorists are active in Cameroon, and there is a high threat of attacks, particularly in the Far North Region, including Lake Chad and the area within 40km of the border with Nigeria.

Terrorist attacks could take place at any time. Attacks may be random and target a wide range of places visited by foreigners, such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship.

To reduce your risk, be alert to suspicious behaviour and items near Cameroonian government and security installations.

Attacks remain possible in both urban and other areas around the country. You should remain vigilant and exercise extreme caution.

#### Terrorism in Northern Cameroon

Terrorist groups operate in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Central African Republic (CAR). Terrorist acts include suicide bomb attacks, kidnappings and armed violence.

Violent conflict in northeastern Nigeria by militant groups affects the safety of northern Cameroon. These occur in the adjacent Nigerian states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.

Militants cross the border to attack the Far North, North and Adamaoua regions of Cameroon.

Foreign nationals could be targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. 

Cameroon and its neighbours, including Nigeria, conduct regular military operations against terrorist groups. The security of Cameroon's border regions has worsened.

Large numbers of people have moved into and across parts of northern Cameroon. This includes displaced Cameroonians and Nigerian refugees.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping is a risk in Cameroon. The threat is very high in:

* the Far North Region
* South-West and North-West Regions
* border areas close to Nigeria's Borno and Adamawa states (North and Adamaoua regions in Cameroon).

Militants have kidnapped several foreigners from this area and there remains a heightened threat of kidnapping to foreigners in this region.

Kidnappers have also targeted foreigners in the Northwest and Southwest regions.

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to an area where there's a risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including muggings, robberies, and attacks on motorists, occurs in urban areas and on intercity highways. Armed highwaymen operate across the country.

Armed bandits are common in the border areas with the Central African Republic.

Avoid isolated and poorer areas of urban areas, including in Yaounde, particularly at night. 

Criminals target roads close to the borders with Nigeria, the Central Africa Republic and Chad.

#### Piracy

Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula.

Pirate attacks have been reported in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Guinea and, in some cases, further out at sea.

Pirates frequent the waters around the ferry crossings between Limbe or Tiko, Cameroon, and Calabar, Nigeria.

Pirates are heavily armed.

Attractive targets for pirates include:

* local fishing dhows
* commercial boats
* pleasure crafts
* luxury cruise liners

Don't travel in the Gulf of Guinea waters or surrounding areas.

If you need to [travel by boat](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel), you should:

* stay out of [designated high-risk War Listed areas](https://latitudebrokers.com/indian-ocean-removed-from-the-piracy-high-risk-area-from-1st-january-2023/)
* travel in groups or convoy
* always stay in close contact with convoy members
* arrange personal security

The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) publishes [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre).

#### Personal security

There is a high risk of mugging, armed robbery and violent crime throughout Cameroon. 

Gangs of gunmen have attacked restaurants and hotels that cater to foreigners.

To reduce your risk of crime:

* avoid travel after dark, especially outside city limits
* always pay attention to your personal security
* when travelling by car, keep doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight.

If you become a victim of violent crime, including rape, seek medical help straight away. The HIV/AIDS infection rate in Cameroon is high (see '[Health](#health)').

#### Petty crime

Thieves are active on trains, coaches, buses and taxis, and around bus stations. Always take care of your belongings when using public transport.

#### Scams and fraud

Commercial and internet fraud often originates in West African countries, including Cameroon.

Online scammers defraud victims. Victims who have travelled to the originating country have put their lives in danger.

Criminals often seek details of 'safe' bank accounts overseas, such as yours. They claim they will transfer large sums of money into the account. Victims believe they will get a donation, or a percentage of the amount involved.

Be aware of other scams where criminals:

* give fake cheques for 'urgent' shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for fake government contracts
* extort money from people the scammers convince to travel to Africa for business opportunities.

To protect yourself against a scam, be wary of:

* any request to send money to a person in Cameroon
* any invitation to Cameroon to meet someone you have met over the internet.

Be careful about giving out personal information or disposing of personal documents in Cameroon.

Scammers can access your personal data when you use open networks. Be careful when and where you use internet banking and other sites that transmit or store your data or passwords.

Don't travel to Cameroon to try to get your money back or seek revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Bogus dating schemes

Criminals in West Africa operate fake online friendship, dating and marriage schemes.

Scammers use these schemes to defraud and threaten the lives of Australians. They do this by targeting Australians and other foreigners on internet dating sites or chat rooms. They may pose as a prospective friend or spouse.

Once a friendship develops, the scammer asks for money to allow them to travel to Australia. Sometimes, the scammer ends the relationship once the money has been sent. There's little chance of getting the money back.

In other cases, foreigners are lured to Africa to meet their prospective friend or marriage partner. Once in Africa, they may become the victim of kidnapping, assault, robbery or extortion.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Northwest and Southwest regions

Due to conflict between Anglophone separatists and Cameroon government forces, tensions in the Northwest and Southwest (Anglophone) regions are high. There have been multiple clashes between the Cameroonian security forces and armed groups in recent years. You should avoid travelling to these regions, including the Bakassi Peninsula, due to the high threat of localised violence and kidnapping. 

People have been killed and injured in armed clashes and explosions in the regional capitals of Buea and Bamenda. Armed groups are increasingly using IEDs, which have previously been used to target civilians in these regions. There's continuing potential for this civil unrest to degrade into armed conflict. Restrictions, including night curfews and a ban on public meetings, remain in place in some areas.

The Northwest and Southwest regions may have:

* general strikes
* telecommunications disruptions
* movement restrictions
* curfews.

#### Adamaoua and East regions

Sometimes, civil unrest and armed conflict in the Central African Republic has spilled across the border into Cameroon. That conflict mostly affects outposts in the Adamaoua and East regions.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests, demonstrations and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Civil unrest is possible in other parts of Cameroon, not only the Northwest and Southwest regions.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings
* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

Curfews could be imposed in parts of Cameroon. Obey local authorities on all curfews and movement restrictions.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Cameroon experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), flooding and volcanic eruptions.

To protect yourself during a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family

#### Flooding

The rainy season is:

* June to September in the north
* July to November in the south

Rain may cause flooding and make roads impassable during these periods.

#### Volcanoes

Mount Cameroon is an active [volcano](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") that may experience explosions and lava flows. Ask local authorities before climbing it.

Nyos and Monoum volcanic lakes sometimes give off toxic fumes. Seek advice from local authorities before visiting.
