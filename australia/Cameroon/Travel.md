#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You must have a visa to enter Cameroon.

You'll need to apply for a Cameroonian visa online via the [Cameroonian Government's E-visa system](https://www.evisacam.cm/ords/dl_portal/r/public_portal/home) before departing for Cameroon. You cannot get a visa on arrival.

You must sign up to the online portal, complete the required information, upload supporting documents and pay the necessary fees before Cameroonian authorities will process it.

Applicants travelling from countries without a Cameroonian Embassy or High Commission will be issued an online visa authorisation with a QR code. You must bring a printed copy of this authorisation and original copies of all supporting documents with you. A visa sticker will be issued in your passport only after border control checks these on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [High Commission of the Republic of Cameroon](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/37) for the latest details and visit the [Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency's website](https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/covid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/) (in French) for the latest health measures in place for entry into Cameroon. 

Flight availability may change rapidly due to travel disruptions. Access via Cameroon's land and sea borders remains restricted.

#### Border measures

All documents presented to border authorities must be in one of the official languages of Cameroon, French or English.

In the past, borders with Cameroon's neighbours have closed with little or no warning. Monitor news and consult travel providers for the latest updates.

We continue to advise you not to travel within 40km of the border with the Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria due to unpredictable security conditions and the high threat of terrorist attacks, kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery, assault and carjacking. If, despite our advice, you travel to the border with Central African Republic, Chad or Nigeria, consider engaging professional security support and planning.

#### Gabon border

Very poor road conditions make it difficult to cross the land border with Gabon. If you plan to take this route:

* plan carefully
* travel in convoy wherever possible
* take a VHF radio and satellite phone
* don't rely on mobile phone coverage, which is limited

#### Other formalities

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Cameroon and neighbouring countries.

To protect yourself and to avoid entry issues, get vaccinated for yellow fever before you travel (see [Health)](/node/43).

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Cameroon is largely a cash economy.

The local currency is the Central African CFA Franc (XAF).

Large hotels usually accept US dollars and Euros. You can exchange US dollars and euros for local currency. Australian dollars are not accepted.

Credit card facilities are not widespread, but major hotels may accept them. Traveller’s cheques are not widely accepted.

ATMs that accept international cards are limited and may attract heavy fees. Check ATM locations with your bank before you travel.

Fraud and skimming are high risks when using debit and credit cards with ATMs or EFTPOS machines. Pay careful attention when using these or when others are handling your cards. Report any unauthorised transactions to your bank immediately.

#### Transport

#### Road travel

Driving in Cameroon is dangerous. Hazards include:

* poor road conditions
* poorly maintained vehicles
* local driving practices and unpredictable pedestrians
* poor signage, lighting and lack of working traffic lights

If bystanders believe you are at fault in a road accident, they may become hostile.

Avoid driving at night.

Be alert to security threats, particularly in traffic jams and at traffic lights. Keep your doors locked and windows up at all times.

Police and gendarmerie roadblocks are common in Cameroon. You may need to show your passport, driver’s licence, visa/residence permit and vehicle registration documents. 

Officers may detain you if you can’t produce identification, or they may seek small on the spot ‘fines’ for perceived infractions. You should ask the officer for a ticket setting out the alleged offence and pay any fines at a local court to avoid inadvertently paying a bribe.

You may be able to use your Australian licence to drive in Cameroon with an international driver’s permit for up to six months. If you are staying longer, you must get a local Cameroonian licence.

Rental cars may be available, but you should confirm their insurance coverage and maintenance record prior to driving. 

Fuel shortages occur occasionally in Cameroon. Local authorities may impose fuel rationing, leading to line-ups at petrol stations. 

If you are driving through rural areas, plan in advance, avoid travelling after dark, maintain an emergency supply of water, food and fuel, and bring multiple reliable means of communication including a satellite phone and VHF radio.

#### Taxis

We do not recommend using taxis or ridesharing apps and strongly advise against hailing taxis from the street due to high crime levels.

Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the vehicle. They often take indirect routes. Many don't meet basic safety requirements.

There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies of taxi and rideshare passengers.

If, despite our advice, you choose to travel by taxi, use only trusted registered taxis or transportation arranged by the hotel.

Avoid all travel on motorcycle taxis, locally called ‘okada’, as these are driven recklessly, helmets are not provided and they are frequently involved in accidents.

#### Rail travel

Rail travel is possible between Douala, Yaoundé and Ngaoundéré. However, many rail tracks and trains in Cameroon are in poor condition. Safety and security on board trains and around stations are not up to Australian standards.

#### Sea travel

At sea or on ships in port, you may encounter piracy, hijacking, kidnapping or armed robbery. While Cameroonian security forces patrol their waters, they may not have the capacity to respond to all events.

Piracy is a threat in the Gulf of Guinea, and particularly in the waters around the Niger Delta and the Bakassi Peninsula. Do not travel by boat in this region.

Pirates are heavily armed and target passenger ferries, local fishing boats, commercial boats, pleasure craft and luxury cruise liners.

The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) publishes [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/imb-piracy-reporting-centre-2/).

Safety and reliability of domestic and inter-country ferry services, especially between Cameroon and Nigeria, is a concern. Maintenance procedures and safety standards are not to Australian standards. If you travel on these services, insurance may not cover you.

#### Air travel

Scheduled flights to, from and within Cameroon are often delayed or cancelled. 

Arrange for someone to meet you on arrival at the airport. Make sure you have confirmed prearranged transport.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Cameroon's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TJ) with the Aviation Safety Network.
