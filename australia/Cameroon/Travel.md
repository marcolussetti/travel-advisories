#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need to apply for a Cameroonian visa online via the [Cameroonian Government's E-visa system](https://www.evisacam.cm/ords/dl_portal/r/public_portal/home) before departing for Cameroon.

You must sign up to the online portal, complete the required information, upload supporting documents and pay the necessary fees before Cameroonian authorities will process it.

Applicants travelling from countries without a Cameroonian Embassy or High Commission will be issued an online visa authorisation with a QR code. You must bring a printed copy of this authorisation and original copies of all supporting documents with you. A visa sticker will be issued in your passport only after border control checks these on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [High Commission of the Republic of Cameroon](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/37) for the latest details or visit the [Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency's website](https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/covid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/) (in French). 

Flight availability may change rapidly due to travel disruptions. Access via Cameroon's land and sea borders remains restricted.

#### Border measures

All documents presented to border authorities must be in one of the official languages of Cameroon, French or English.

In the past, borders with Cameroon's neighbours have closed with little or no warning. Monitor news and consult travel providers for the latest updates.

We continue to advise you not to travel within 40km of the border with the Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria due to unpredictable security conditions and the high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery, assault and carjacking. If, despite our advice, you travel to the border with Central African Republic, Chad or Nigeria, consider engaging professional security support and planning.

#### Gabon border

Very poor road conditions make it difficult to cross the land border with Gabon. If you plan to take this route:

* plan carefully
* travel in convoy wherever possible
* take a VHF radio or satellite phone
* don't rely on mobile phone coverage, which is limited

#### Other formalities

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Cameroon and neighbouring countries.

To protect yourself and to avoid entry issues, get vaccinated for yellow fever before you travel (see [Health)](/node/43).

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Cameroon is largely a cash economy.

The local currency is the Central African CFA Franc (XAF).

Hotels accept US dollars and euros. You can exchange US dollars and euros for local currency. Australian dollars are not accepted.

Credit card facilities are not widespread, but most major hotels accept credit cards.

ATMs that accept international cards are limited. Check ATM locations with your bank before you travel.

#### Transport

#### Road travel

Driving in Cameroon is dangerous. Hazards include:

* poor road conditions
* poorly maintained vehicles
* local driving practices
* poor lighting.

If bystanders believe you are at fault in a road accident, they may become hostile.

Avoid driving at night.

#### Flooding

Road travel during the rainy season may be difficult. Heavy rains and flash floods can make roads impassable (see [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/cameroon#safety)).

#### Proof of identity

Police checkpoints are common in Cameroon. Police may ask drivers and passengers to pay money.

Police might detain you if you can't show identification (ID). Make sure you carry an ID such as:

* residence permit
* driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* international driver's permit (IDP)
* certified copy of your passport

#### Taxis

We do not recommend using taxis and strongly advise against hailing taxis from the street due to high crime levels.

Taxis in cities operate like buses, picking up passengers while there is still room in the vehicle. They often take indirect routes. Many don't meet basic safety requirements.

There have been reports of violent assaults and robberies of taxi passengers.

If, despite our advice, you choose to travel by taxi, use only trusted taxis or transportation arranged by the hotel.

#### Rail travel

Rail travel is possible between Douala, Yaoundé and Ngaoundéré. However, many rail tracks and trains in Cameroon are in poor condition. 

#### Air travel

Arrange for someone to meet you on arrival at the airport. Make sure you have confirmed prearranged transport.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Cameroon's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TJ) with the Aviation Safety Network.
