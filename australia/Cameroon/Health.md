#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including hospital stays and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring any medication, check if it's legal in Cameroon. Take enough legal medication for your trip. Don’t assume the same medication will be available in Cameroon if your supply runs out. The quality of medication in Cameroon can’t be guaranteed and local pharmacies may not accept Australian prescriptions.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Other insect-borne diseases include:

* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in Cameroon. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

To protect yourself from diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* get vaccinated against yellow fever.

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection in Cameroon is high. Take precautions before you do anything that puts you at risk of infection.

#### Other infectious diseases

There's currently an outbreak of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa, including in Cameroon. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with infected people, animals (especially primates and rodents) and items that may have come into contact with them.

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are widespread. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in urban centres are very basic. They're extremely limited in rural areas.

Medical facilities often lack trained staff. They may have poor hygiene, outdated equipment, a lack of water and medical supplies.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency. You may need to bring or buy your own basic medical supplies, such as gloves, soap, sheets and other medical resources.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need evacuation to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Make sure your insurance covers this risk.
