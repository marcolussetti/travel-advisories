# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46), but we can't get you out of jail.

**More information:**

* [Arrested or in prison](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/arrested-jailed)

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They may include long jail terms and large fines.

#### Proof of identity

Always carry proof of your identification (ID), such as a residence permit or a certified copy of your passport.

Police might detain you if you can't show a valid ID.

#### Other laws

Penalties for serious crimes, such as murder, include the death penalty.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are illegal. Penalties for same-sex activity include both:

* 6 months to 5 years jail

#### Dual citizenship

Cameroon doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in Cameroon. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.
