# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The nearest Australian Embassy is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It doesn't have direct access to police, jails, hospitals and other services. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Bahrain may be limited.

The Australian Embassy has to formally ask for access through the Bahraini Embassy in Riyadh. Authorities approve this on a case-by-case basis, so there may be a delay.

Behaviour in Australia that you might consider offensive or anti-social, but not criminal, could be illegal in Bahrain. Anyone breaking Bahraini law, even without knowing, may be subject to severe punishment.

Bahraini law applies to you even if you're transiting and don't leave the airport.

It is illegal to give birth out of wedlock. Bahrain does not recognise children born outside marriage and does not issue birth certificates for children born outside marriage.

Non-Muslims who are officially residents in Bahrain may be allowed to marry in civil or religious ceremonies. However, all marriages must be registered with a Bahraini civil court. Civil courts also adjudicate matters such as divorce and child custody for non-Muslims. Seek local legal advice for more details.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, including buying, selling and possession, even if you are transiting Bahrain, are severe and include the death penalty and life sentences.

Some cosmetics products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Bahrain, such as Cannabidiol (CBD) oil. For more information, please contact and check with your nearest Bahraini Embassy or consulate prior to your departure to Bahrain.

You can be charged with possession if trace amounts of drugs are found on your body, clothing, or luggage.

Local police may detain you if you're accompanied by someone who is involved in drug cases, including trafficking, possessing, or using drugs. You may remain in detention until investigations of all parties are concluded.

#### Commercial and family law

Bahrain's laws differ from Australia's in several areas, including:

* commercial and employment matters
* Family law and divorce
* child custody
* child support

If you have family, employment or commercial interests in Bahrain, get professional legal advice from a lawyer in Bahrain on your legal rights and responsibilities.

Authorities might stop you from leaving Bahrain if you have a commercial or labour dispute, legal proceedings or unpaid debts. See ('Travel').

Read the [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

#### Other laws

You may face the death penalty for serious crimes, including murder and drug offences.

You may face imprisonment, deportation, fines, and future bans on re-entering the country for some offences, including stealing.

Always carry photo ID, or authorities may fine you.

You must have a valid work permit from the relevant Bahraini authority for any type of employment. Do not work in Bahrain on a tourist or non-work visa. Being involved in any kind of work or employment (paid or unpaid) without a valid and official work permit will result in detention, fine and deportation from Bahrain.

If you drive under the influence of alcohol, authorities will detain, fine and ban you from driving.

Drinking excessively while in transit through the airport could result in detention and a fine.

Be careful if you're using a taxi when intoxicated. If you have a dispute with a driver or vomit in a taxi, you may be:

* taken directly to a police station
* charged with public intoxication.

You may be arrested and jailed for criticising or mocking Government policies or people in Bahrain. This includes if you made comments on social media before you arrived in Bahrain.

Bahraini authorities have arrested and jailed people who made posts about Islam on social media. Bahraini law criminalises the mocking of any of Bahrain's recognised religious books, including some non-Muslim texts.

It's illegal to:

* try to convert a Muslim to another religion
* make offensive remarks about or insult Bahrain, the royal family, Islam, other religious beliefs, the local government or officials
* use offensive language, swear or abuse people, or make rude gestures in public or on social media
* join protests and demonstrations
* possess pornography
* have sex or give birth outside of marriage
* possess or sell homemade wine/alcohol

It's also illegal to:

* not comply with police officials' instructions
* support any group or organisation considered by Bahraini authorities to practice violence
* import, possess or trade in weapons
* earn an income from social media or any other platform without a license from the relevant local Bahraini authorities.
* be involved in charity and fundraising activities, including online or via social media, without prior approval from local authorities.

These actions may still be illegal, even if they were made outside Bahrain and years prior to your visit.

Ask for permission before photographing people. Don't take photos of locals, especially women and children, without permission.

In some cases, it's illegal to take photos of government buildings, official motorcades and sensitive infrastructure, including oil fields.

Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

Women may be taken into custody when reporting sexual assault, as they may have to prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged under extramarital sex laws. For more details, please check the local laws and seek legal advice from a local lawyer.

If you're associated with groups that are anti-Bahrain government, you could be refused entry or arrested and detained.

The personal and commercial use of drones in Bahrain is controlled by Bahraini rules and regulations. There are some restrictions to the use of drones in Bahrain. The [Civil Aviation Affairs](https://mtt.gov.bh/directorates/civil-aviation) (CAA) advises that drone operations are allowed in Bahrain, subject to regulations. Contact the [CAA](https://mtt.gov.bh/directorates/civil-aviation) and the Kingdom of Bahrain [Ministry of Interior Customs Affairs](https://www.bahraincustoms.gov.bh/en) for information and requirements on approval to bring or use a drone in Bahrain.

#### Media activity

You must obtain permission in advance from the Bahraini authorities to undertake media activity relating to the production, transmission or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video or visual information. If you fail to do this, you could be arrested, fined, and deported from Bahrain. Local authorities may also ban you from re-entering the country in the future.

Contact your nearest Bahraini Embassy/Consulate and the [Bahraini Ministry of Information for](https://www.mia.gov.bh/contact-us/?lang=en) more information on obtaining the necessary permits to carry out media activity in Bahrain and bringing media equipment into Bahrain.

* local Bahraini police on 999
* the Protection Centre & Helpline on 998
* [Ministry of Social Development](https://www.social.gov.bh/?lang=en) - (Family Counselling Center) on 80008001

Children and minors who may be victims of cybercrimes, cyberbullying, grooming, potential sexual or physical assault, and other forms of harm can contact the [General Directorate of Anti-Corruption and Economic & Electronic Security](https://www.bahrain.bh/wps/portal/en/BNP/AboutTheKingdom/CyberSecurity) on 992 from a local Bahraini mobile or landline number.

When reporting domestic violence:

* get a case reference number
* document any injuries and get a copy of any medical reports.

If you file a police report or use any Bahraini victim services, authorities may inform your sponsor or guardian.

#### Custody disputes

Sharia (Islamic) courts have jurisdiction over custody cases involving Muslim parents. The Embassy of Australia cannot intervene in court proceedings, private and/or legal matters including family and custody disputes. Seek advice from acompetent local lawyer.

Custody orders and judgments issued by foreign courts may not be enforceable in Bahrain.

Bahraini Civil courts also adjudicate cases related to divorce and child custody for non-Muslims. When a custody case arises between parents and one of the parents is Muslim, custody decisions may be based on Islamic law.

When custody disputes arise and a custody case is before the local court, the local court may impose a travel ban on the child/children.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Bahrain doesn't recognise dual nationality. Authorities may seize extra passports if they find them, and charges may be laid, including imprisonment if you hold a second nationality without permission from the relevant Bahraini authorities.

If you're a dual citizen and you enter Bahrain on your non-Australian passport, this may limit the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can provide you.

If you're a dual national of another country (for example, an Australian-UK citizen) you can only exit Bahrain with the passport that you used to enter.

#### Local customs

The Bahraini weekend is Friday and Saturday.

Respect religious and cultural sensitivities, rules and customs. Be aware of sensitivity around Ramadan and Shia religious festivals.

#### Ramadan

Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during the Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan").

Avoid dressing inappropriately, eating, drinking or smoking in public or around people who are fasting.

#### Dress and behaviour standards

Standards of dress and behaviour are generally more conservative than in Australia.

If you disrespect Islam, you'll cause great offence, and locals may report you to the local police.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Travelling as a couple

Hotels may refuse couples who can't prove they're married.

Avoid public displays of affection which may cause offence.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults aged over 21 years are not criminalised. However, LGBTI activity isn't socially accepted. It's likely to attract the attention of Bahraini authorities under some broader morality and public order laws.

Some LGBTI travellers have reported difficulties entering Bahrain on a passport bearing a name and photo that do not correspond to their gender identity. For more information, please contact your nearest Bahraini Embassy or Consulate prior to your departure to Bahrain.
