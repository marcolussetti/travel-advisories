## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions. There's an ongoing threat of attacks against Israeli interests across the region.
* Ongoing hostilities pose serious security risks across the region. Bahrain is host to regional security infrastructure, including the Combined Maritime Forces
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Demonstrations and protests may also occur, including those against foreign governments. Local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Public rallies and meetings of large groups are illegal. Don't get caught up in demonstrations. Take care around Friday prayers due to the possibility of unrest.
* The level of crime overall in Bahrain is low, although pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs. Take care near the old market areas (souks).
* The weather is very hot from June to August. Sandstorms and dust storms are common. Monitor local media for updates.
