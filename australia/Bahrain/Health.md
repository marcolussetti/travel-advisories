#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs and hospital stays, including medical evacuation. There's no healthcare agreement between Australia and the Kingdom of Bahrain. Tourists must pay for treatment. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) of Australia to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

If you need counselling services, contact the Australian Consular Emergency Centre on (+61) 2 6261 3305. Ask to speak to a Lifeline telephone counsellor.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Bahrain by contacting the nearest Bahraini [Embassy or Consulate](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=6089&language=en-US) or [Bahraini Customs](https://www.bahraincustoms.gov.bh/en) prior to your departure to Bahrain.

Some skincare products and E-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Bahrain such as Cannabidiol (CBD) oil. CBD oil or products are illegal in Bahrain even if they are for medical or recreational purposes. It is considered a serious crime to carry illegal drugs or CBD oil or products in Bahrain, even if you are transiting through the airport Bahrain from another country. Punishment can result in imprisonment and deportation. 

For more information, please contact and check with your nearest Bahraini Embassy or consulate prior to your departure to Bahrain.

Take enough legal medicine for your trip. Carry your medicine in its original packaging and a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor that states:

* your name
* the medicine's brand and scientific (chemical) name
* the prescribed dosage and the duration of treatment, and
* that it's for your personal use

Get DFAT to [authenticate medical documents](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") before you leave, if required.

Bahraini authorities may detain or deport travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis - see [Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/united-arab-emirates#health)

Health facilities and pharmacies are required to report HIV-positive foreigners to the Ministry of Health, which could lead to detention and deportation.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical care is high. In some facilities the care may be below Australian standards. Facilities for travellers with a disability are different from those in Australia. 

You may have to pay before treatment begins. Costs can be high.

The Bahraini Government may ask you to repay all costs of emergency treatment.

If you did not pay or can't afford to pay your medical bill and you didn't get travel insurance:

* you could be arrested or jailed
* you could be sued by the hospital
* you may not be able to leave the country until you pay

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure that your insurance can cover these costs.
