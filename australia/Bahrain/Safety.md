# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Terrorists have killed and injured people in recent years. Targets have included police and security services.

Bahraini authorities warn residents and foreigners to avoid suspicious packages and objects.

Attacks could occur at any time. Possible targets include:

* government and military sites, and security personnel
* police patrols
* critical infrastructure including oil refineries and storage sites
* public areas and parks
* places of worship
* places popular with foreigners, such as tourist sites, hotels, shops, restaurants, bars and cafes
* crowded areas, sporting and cultural events and other high-profile events
* foreign embassies and other symbols of western culture

Authorities have increased security. They may reinforce these measures at short notice.

Maintain personal security and awareness. Monitor local media and security developments and announcements from local authorities. Adjust your plans if conditions become unsafe.

For assistance and emergency services, call 999.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning. Ongoing hostilities pose serious security risks across the region. There are reports of military debris falling in various locations. Bahrain is host to regional security infrastructure, including the Combined Maritime Forces.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw groups of people can turn violent.

Demonstrations and protests can take place at any time and place. Even peaceful demonstrations and protests can turn violent without warning.

Since 2011, protests and clashes have occurred throughout Bahrain, including in:

* Manama
* Shia-majority villages
* Budaiya
* Hamad Town
* Saar
* Sanabis
* Sitra

Protests and clashes may take place in other locations. Security forces sometimes use force to disperse protesters. Demonstrations can result in blockages to roads, highways, and other routes, including to or from the airport, and the causeway with Saudi Arabia. Security checkpoints can be deployed in or around the areas of demonstrations and protests.

Public rallies and meetings of large groups without the permission of the authorities are illegal. You could face legal action if you join them. If you're caught up in unrest, authorities could arrest you.

Monitor the media for political and regional tensions, and any announcements or warnings by the local authorities.

Avoid:

* public gatherings and protests
* Wearing clothing of a political nature that may be seen as a form of protest
* places where Bahraini Ministry of Interior forces gather
* potential unrest on days of national or commemorative importance
* travel outside the inner-city area at night

Take extra care around the time of Friday prayers, periods of mourning and religious anniversaries and festivals.

If you're in an affected area:

* be prepared to change your travel plans
* leave the area as soon as it's safe, or stay indoors and away from windows
* follow the advice and instructions of local authorities

If unrest disrupts transport, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for advice.

#### Crime

The overall level of crime in Bahrain is low, however pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs. Criminals target the old market areas (souks).

To protect yourself against petty theft:

* be aware of your surroundings
* keep a close eye on your belongings
* leave valuables in a safe place and carry only what you need
* keep your passport and other travel documents safe
* keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* monitor local sources for information about possible safety or security risks

Where possible, avoid travelling alone or at night in isolated places.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Make sure any unused SIM cards are kept in a safe place or deactivated by contacting your service provider to prevent misuse by others. Do not share any verification code received on your mobile with others. Verify any text message claiming to be from the bank by communicating directly with the bank.

* follow the advice of local authorities

At the beach, be aware of strong currents and obey warning signs. There may be no safety information displayed at some beaches.

To protect yourself at the beach:

* get local advice before swimming
* be alert to changes in sea conditions, including rips
* swim within your ability.

**Tours and adventure activities**

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts
* if proper safety equipment isn't available, use another certified provider.
