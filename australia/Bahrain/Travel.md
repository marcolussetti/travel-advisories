#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit rules can change at short notice. Contact your nearest Bahraini Embassy or Consulate for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Bahrain has resumed visas on arrival for Australian passport holders. Please check with local authorities for further details on visa requirements. Visas to enter Bahrain can also be obtained online through their [eVisa](http://www.evisa.gov.bh/) portal.

If you're already in Bahrain and need to renew your Bahraini visa or require any information on Bahraini visas while in the country, you can contact the office of [Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs](https://www.npra.gov.bh/en/) (NPRA) at the Ministry of Interior.

If you've had a travel ban placed against you in the past to prevent you from re-entering Bahrain, you should check the duration of the ban prior to your arrival, or you may be denied entry.

You may be arrested when you arrive if you have a previous unresolved legal case in Bahrain. This is regardless of the passport you use to re-enter the country. 

Tourists under 18 may not be allowed to enter Bahrain unless accompanied by a guardian.

If you overstay your visa, you may face:

* a significant fine
* detention while waiting to be deported
* a ban from re-entering the country.

Deportation processes may take time to resolve.

There's no Bahraini Embassy in Australia. The nearest [Embassy of Bahrain](https://www.mofa.gov.bh) is in Jakarta, Indonesia.

#### Staying in Bahrain

Mandatory [COVID-related health preventative measures](https://healthalert.gov.bh/en/category/covid-19-protocols) may be in place. Please check with local authorities for up-to-date information.

#### Other formalities

Authorities may ask detailed questions about why you're visiting. They sometimes refuse entry to Australians based on their answers.

They may not let you enter or exit Bahrain:

* if you're travelling on an emergency passport
* if your passport shows 'X' for indeterminate, intersex or unspecified in the sex field
* if the name and/or photo in your passport are different from how you present

The legal age of maturity in Bahrain is 21. A child of a Bahraini father does not need his permission to leave Bahrain unless there's a travel ban imposed on the child in connection with custody proceedings. 

#### Border areas

Bahrain's only land exit is into Saudi Arabia. The King Fahd causeway land crossing border is open. If you're exiting Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, please read the travel advice for Saudi Arabia. If exiting by vehicle, your vehicle will likely be searched.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. If you're travelling on an Emergency Passport, you may not be allowed entry to Bahrain. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Australian travel-related documents issued to non-Australian citizens may not be accepted to enter Bahrain with an electronic visa (even if you obtained the visa online before your arrival). You'll need to contact your nearest Bahraini Embassy/Consulate for up-to-date advice and information on accepting your travel document and to seek options and confirmation on the appropriate visa that will be accepted to enter the country. If your entry into Bahrain is denied despite you having a valid Bahraini visa, the Embassy of Australia in Riyadh won't be able to assist you in facilitating your entry.

Airlines may not allow holders of Australian travel-related documents issued to non-Australian citizens to board flights to Australia. Check your eligibility to re-enter Australia with the Department of Home Affairs and confirm with your airlines before your departure.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx) of Australia.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) of your destination before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Bahrain has rules about the amount of currency you can bring in and take out. Currency limits can change. Check details with your nearest [Bahraini Embassy](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/) or [Bahrain Customs](https://www.bahraincustoms.gov.bh/en) before your departure to Bahrain.

The local currency is the Bahraini Dinar (BHD).

Credit card facilities and ATMs are widely available.

Ask your bank if your cards will work in Bahrain.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Road travel can be dangerous. Unsafe driving is common, especially speeding. Public transport buses in Bahrain are very limited.

Visitors can use a foreign driver's licence and an international driver's licence for a certain period. The international licence must be endorsed by an office of the Bahraini traffic department or at any car rental office (available at the airport).

Be aware that:

* driving in Bahrain is on the right-hand side of the road
* police can detain drivers for traffic violations
* it is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.

If an accident has led to legal proceedings, both drivers may be banned from leaving Bahrain until the issue is resolved. 

Visitors to Bahrain can only drive hire cars and not privately owned vehicles. You may only be allowed to use your Australian driving licence and International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 3 months from arrival in the country. Check with the local Traffic Police and your rental company for up-to-date information.

If you have a residency permit in Bahrain, you must obtain a Bahraini driver's licence. This can be done in one day through Bahrain's traffic department. Applicants for the licence need to pass a vision test.

You must carry your driver's licence and vehicle registration cards when driving. If you're involved in an accident, notify the traffic police and ask for their instructions.

Watch for roaming animals and drifting sands.

Off-road driving can be dangerous. Ensure vehicles are suitably equipped and maintained.

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance covers you
* learn and adhere to local traffic rules and behaviour, including speed limits
* do not cross any red lights
* know what to do in case of an incident or accident
* always keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* stay alert, especially when driving at night

The minimum driving age is 18 years old.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use licensed taxis, ride-hailing service providers, and limousines, preferably arranged through your accommodation or licensed rideshare services.

If you choose to use official public marked taxis, ensure that the driver turns the meter on before you start the journey.

Don't share taxis with unknown passengers and refuse offers from drivers who approach you.

#### Sea travel

Many areas of the Gulf are sensitive to security issues and territorial disputes.

Disputes about sea boundaries can occur. There are disagreements about the sea boundaries and control of Abu Musa and Tunbs islands in the Southern Gulf.

Authorities can inspect your vessel, detain you and arrest you. There can be government curfews on the waters.

Ships and boats might not meet the safety standards you'd expect in Australia.

Always use available safety equipment, such as life jackets, even if others don't.

If the right safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

You may be at risk of [piracy](/node/358) in the Gulf. Read the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre).

Current regional tensions pose an increased threat to maritime security, including the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz. Monitor the local and international media for up-to-date information.
