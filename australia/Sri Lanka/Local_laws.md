# Local laws

#### Local law

Legal proceedings in Sri Lanka are often lengthy. You may not be permitted to depart the country while legal proceedings are ongoing, and this may also apply when you are the victim of a crime.

In certain cases, Sri Lankan law permits:

* arrest without warrant
* extended detention without charge or trial
* reversal of the onus of proof

Public Emergencies can be declared, and curfews imposed at short notice.

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for carrying or using illegal drugs are severe and include the death penalty.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in Sri Lanka. Respect religious traditions and objects. Take care not to offend.

Respect local restrictions and observances around religious holidays.

Full moon (Poya) days are celebrated once a month. Authorities ban the sale and purchase of alcohol and fresh meat on these days.

Seek local advice before you take photos of places of worship and nearby areas. You may cause offence.
