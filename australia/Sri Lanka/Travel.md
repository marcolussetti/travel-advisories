#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

To enter Sri Lanka, you'll need a visa in the form of an [Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)](https://eta.gov.lk/slvisa/). You should do this before you travel, as there are limited facilities to obtain an ETA on arrival at Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport.

If you engage in activities that breach your visa conditions, authorities could detain or deport you.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

Contact the [High Commission of Sri Lanka](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/186) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Pay close attention to the date your visa expires. You could receive a large fine if you overstay your visa.

#### Yellow fever and Cholera

If you're travelling from a country with yellow fever or cholera you need to present evidence that you've received the relevant immunisations.

You need a yellow fever vaccination certificate even if you've only transited through an affected country. This rule applies for the 9 days before you enter Sri Lanka. Babies under one year old are exempt.

Border authorities and airlines may request evidence of immunisations. All travellers should carry proof of vaccination status in English.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR).

You can change Australian dollars for LKR at:

* the airport
* commercial banks in major centres

Most major towns and cities have ATMs. Some ATMs don't accept international cards.

You can withdraw cash from Visa and MasterCard cards at most major banks.

Hotels and major shops will accept credit cards.

Before you travel, ask your bank if your cards will work in Sri Lanka.

Check your statements, as credit card fraud and card-skimming occur.

#### Local travel

#### High Security Zones

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence to:

* meet military officials
* visit military establishments
* enter High Security Zones

Limit travel in High Security Zones and near military and government installations.

Be ready to present your approval documents at roadblocks and checkpoints.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Sri Lanka, you need either:

* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP) endorsed by the Automobile Association of Sri Lanka (AA)
* a temporary Sri Lankan driver’s licence from the [Department of Motor Traffic](https://dmt.gov.lk/index.php?lang=en)

To apply for a local licence, you must pay the fee and provide:

* your Australian driver’s licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* a copy of your passport
* a copy of your Sri Lankan visa
* passport photos

If you drive without an IDP or Sri Lankan driver's licence, you may not be covered by your travel or vehicle insurance.

#### Road travel

Demonstrations in Sri Lanka can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transport.

Driving in Sri Lanka is hazardous. Road accident injuries and deaths are common.

Driving standards are poor. Vehicles aren't well maintained.

If you plan to drive in Sri Lanka:

* learn local traffic laws and practices

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

If you have a local SIM card, ridesharing apps are available in major cities. However, vehicle standards vary.

#### Public transport

Demonstrations in Sri Lanka can lead to disruptions to public transport.

Safety standards on buses and trains may be lower than in Australia.

There are a high number of road deaths and injuries, especially on intercity buses. There have also been fatal accidents on Sri Lankan railways in recent years.

Take care of your belongings because theft occurs. See [Safety](#safety).
