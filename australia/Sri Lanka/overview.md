## Overview

### Safety

* Public demonstrations can occur throughout Sri Lanka. Demonstrations can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transport. Avoid areas impacted by demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media for updates.
* Public emergencies can be declared, and curfews imposed at short notice. Carry relevant travel and identification documents with you at all times.
* Always carry travel and identification documents. Allow additional time to clear security checks, especially at airports.
* Crime, including sexual assault, harassment and robbery, can occur. If you're travelling alone, arrange travel through a reputable company.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas.](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying)
* There are marked and unmarked minefields and unexploded weapons in the Northern Province and parts of the Eastern Province. Stay on the main roads. Pay close attention to landmine warning signs.
* Scams and fraud are common, including credit card fraud, overcharging and fake goods. Be alert to fake goods, especially jewellery and gems. Check your bank statements often.
