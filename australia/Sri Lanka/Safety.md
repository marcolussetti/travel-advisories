# Safety

#### Terrorism

There is an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and tourists, including in regional and coastal towns.

The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Terrorism can occur anywhere at any time. Be alert to possible threats. Take official warnings seriously. Terrorists may target areas popular with foreigners and/or visited by tourists.

To reduce your risk of being involved in a terrorist attack:

* avoid crowded areas
* always be alert
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media and other sources

A terrorist attack on 21 April 2019 targeted prominent hotels and churches in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. Over 250 people were killed, and more than 450 injured.

When you're travelling:

* carry travel and identification documents for any checkpoints
* allow additional time to clear security formalities
* be prepared to undergo increased security checks at [Bandaranaike International Airport](https://www.airport.lk/)

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public demonstrations can occur throughout Sri Lanka and may become violent. Tear gas and water cannons may be used.

Demonstrations can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transport. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media for updates.

Public emergencies can be declared, and curfews imposed at short notice. Carry relevant travel and photo identification documents with you at all times.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid all protests and large public gatherings
* monitor the news for planned or possible unrest
* obey curfews and seek local advice on safety and security
* follow the instructions of security personnel

If you're detained, ask to contact the Australian High Commission (see '[Local contacts](#local-contacts)').

Security forces are visible, particularly in the Northern and Eastern provinces.

Military and police have wide-ranging powers and may:

* establish checkpoints or road closures without warning
* impose curfews
* detain people without charge for long periods
* search people, vehicles, homes or commercial premises

Authorities may apply travel restrictions for foreigners without notice.

#### Landmines

Marked and unmarked minefields and unexploded weapons remain in some areas. Most are in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Most of the Eastern Province has been cleared but some isolated areas remain uncleared.

There are marked and unmarked minefields and unexploded weapons in the Northern Province and parts of the Eastern Province. Stay on main roads. Pay close attention to landmine warning signs.

#### Crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching, and other petty crime are risks. Be careful of theft in crowds and these locations:

* markets
* sporting events
* public transport
* hotels and guesthouses

Avoid unlit areas and places away from crowds, including city streets, village lanes and beaches.

Crimes can include:

* verbal harassment
* physical advances
* drink-spiking

To protect yourself:

* keep your belongings close, especially in crowded areas
* don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from strangers
* don't leave your drinks unattended
* if you aren't sure if a drink is safe, leave it
* stay with people you trust at parties and in bars, nightclubs and taxis

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas.](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying)

#### Sexual Assault

Women may experience:

* unwanted attention
* sexual harassment
* assault
* sexual assault

It's rare for people who commit these crimes to be successfully prosecuted by the law.

Take care in:

* areas popular with foreigners
* markets
* public buses
* 3-wheeled vehicles (tuk-tuks)

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/node/363) and fraud are a problem, such as:

* credit card fraud, including skimming
* traders overcharging foreigners for goods or services
* traders selling travellers fake goods, especially jewellery and gems

Ask your credit card provider how to prevent credit card fraud.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as water sports.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/node/356):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check operators' credentials
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Swimming safety

Swimming conditions at some beaches are unsafe, and there can be strong rips.

Lifesaving services are rare and not to the same standard as Australia.

Take appropriate precautions.

Saltwater crocodiles are present in some locations in Sri Lanka, and fatal attacks have occurred. Ask for local advice, and don't swim in rivers or lagoons.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Sri Lanka experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including flooding and landslides.

Tsunamis can occur. There is minimal tsunami evacuation route signage, and many tsunami warning towers are not operational.

If there is a tsunami:

* know the emergency plan at your accommodation
* follow instructions and advice from local authorities
* follow evacuation orders

The monsoon season is from:

* December to March in the north-east
* May to October in the south-west

Flooding and landslides are frequent.

If a [natural disaster](/node/346) occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location or carry it on you at all times (in a waterproof bag)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media and other sources
* keep in touch with friends and family
* consult with your tour operator about disruptions to your travel plans
