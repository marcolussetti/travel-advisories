# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

The minimum age for buying alcohol and tobacco is 18 years.

You can only buy or use marijuana (cannabis) in designated shops if you're a resident of the Netherlands and 18 years or older.

You could face criminal penalties, including fines and jail, if:

* you buy or use cannabis outside of designated places
* you buy or use cannabis in a designated place, but you're not a resident of the Netherlands
* you possess or sell illegal drugs or narcotics, including psychoactive 'magic mushrooms'.

Taking drugs will weaken your decision-making ability, putting you at greater risk of violence, robbery or [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

#### Other laws

Under Dutch law, everyone over 14 years old must carry an ID. You could show either:

* a valid passport
* a driver's licence
* an identity card or
* a Dutch residency card
* Dutch police officers and other authorities can request to see these documents at any time. They may fine you if you can't show your ID.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
