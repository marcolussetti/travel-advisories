#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

The Netherlands is part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries, meaning you can enter the Netherlands without a visa in some cases. In other situations, you'll need a visa before you travel.

Always carry your passport when crossing borders, in the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), even by road or rail.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. 

From 9 December 2024, the Netherlands will have temporary border checks along its land borders with [Belgium](/destinations/europe/belgium "Belgium") and [Germany](/destinations/europe/germany "Germany") for 12 months.

#### Travelling with Children

Border control authorities may be wary of [children travelling](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") with only one parent or guardian. Non-travelling parents can complete a '[Permission to Travel](https://www.government.nl/documents/forms/2016/06/17/consent-letter-for-minors-travelling-abroad)' form to make this easier.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. 

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/142) [the Netherlands](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/142) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* in Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* if you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of the Netherlands is the Euro.

The Netherlands is a member of the European Union (EU). If you travel between the Netherlands and any non-EU country, you must declare over 10,000 euros (or equivalent) cash. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll need to pay a fine if you don't declare or give the wrong information on entry or exit.

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling to or from another EU country. 

**More information:**

* [Government of the Netherlands](https://www.government.nl/topics/holidays-and-travels/declaring-cash-you-are-carrying-into-or-out-of-the-eu)

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the Schengen Area. Stay informed about border conditions by checking local news and asking transport providers.

#### Driving permit

For short visits, you'll need both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

You must be at least 18 years old to drive in the Netherlands.

After 185 days, you'll need to apply for a Dutch licence.

Car rental companies may require both documents.

Digital driver's licences may not be accepted.

Driving without an IDP where one is required can void your travel and vehicle insurance.

You must be at least 21 to hire a car in the Netherlands.

#### Road travel

Road conditions are similar to those in Australia, but some basic rules differ. Drive on the right-hand side and overtake on the left. This is the 'priority to the right' system.

Give way to traffic and cyclists approaching from the right unless otherwise indicated.

Trams, cyclists and mopeds have the right of way.

Get to know the local road rules before you drive or ride a vehicle.

#### Pedestrians and bicycles

* bicycles are common
* many roads have bicycle pathways, usually coloured red, between the pedestrian footpath and the roadway, as well as bicycle traffic lights
* don't walk on these pathways. Cyclists travel fast and have the right of way
* accidents and injuries resulting from collisions between cyclists and pedestrians are common.

#### Mopeds

* Mopeds with a maximum speed of 45kph must be driven in the street, not on bicycle pathways or dedicated bike lanes.
* Both a driver's licence and moped insurance are required.

E-Scooters are illegal.

#### Motorcycles

Ensure your travel insurance covers you when riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use licenced, official metered taxis. Licenced taxis have a blue number plate.

Unlicenced taxis are a problem in larger cities, particularly in Amsterdam.

Rideshare options are legal and readily available.

#### Public Transport

The Netherlands has a well-developed rail transport system between cities and a large tram and bus network in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague.

Pickpockets operate on intercity and international trains.

Pay close attention to your passport and other valuables when on trains, especially when taking international services to Belgium and France.

Check [Home | NS](https://www.ns.nl/en) for timetable, routes, and any service disruptions.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [the Netherlands' air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=PH) with the Aviation Safety Network.
