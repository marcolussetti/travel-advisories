#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the Netherlands. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Health risks in the Netherlands are similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities and care standards are similar to that in Australia. Major hospitals are in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague, and most Doctors and medical professionals speak English. Medical costs are high.

Australia has a [reciprocal health care agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreement-visiting-netherlands?context=22481) with the Netherlands, meaning you can access urgent or emergency treatment in the public hospital system with a valid Medicare card. You can [apply](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreement-visiting-netherlands?context=22481) for your A111 Certificate of Eligibility when you arrive in the Netherlands or before you travel.

The reciprocal health care agreement doesn't:

* cover treatment in private hospitals or as a private patient in a public hospital
* cover treatment if you travel to the Netherlands specifically to get medical treatment
* replace the need for travel insurance.
