#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

The [national terrorism threat level](https://english.nctv.nl/) was raised in December 2023 and remains at level 4 'substantial', meaning there's a realistic possibility of an attack. 

Tourist areas, public transport and transport hubs are possible targets. 

Previous incidents include:

* November 2020 - shots were fired outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in The Hague.
* November 2019 - police arrested two individuals allegedly planning a jihadist terrorist attack.
* March 2019 - a shooting on a tram in Utrecht resulted in 4 dead and 6 injured. Police treated the incident as terror-related.

Terrorist attacks happen across Europe. Targets may include:

* public transport
* transport hubs
* public places frequented by foreigners.

European security services have also stopped some planned attacks.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public areas
* report any suspicious activity to the police
* monitor the media for any new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities.

If there's an attack, leave the area immediately as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Crime

Crimes such as theft, including passport theft, pickpocketing and bag snatching, are more common in summer in urban and tourist areas, particularly in Amsterdam. Thieves often work in pairs, with one distracting and the other stealing from you. ATMs around nightclubs, coffee shops and bars are frequent targets. There's been an increase in reports of theft whilst eating in restaurants, including hotel breakfast rooms.

Pickpockets also target passengers in transportation hubs such as central train stations and Amsterdam Schiphol airport, focusing on bag snatching and mobile devices.

Incidents of petty crime on trains along the Amsterdam—Brussels-Paris routes are frequent. 

To stay safe from crime:

Take care of your belongings, particularly on public transport and in busy tourist spots. When on public transport, ensure you always have visibility and possession of your personal belongings. 

Thieves sometimes pose as plain-clothed police officers. They may ask to check money and credit cards to look for counterfeits. They'll then rob you.

If plain-clothed police ask to check your money or credit cards, offer to walk them to the nearest police station to verify their identity and demands.

In the event of theft, contact the nearest police station and get a police report.

#### Drink Spiking

Drink spiking can occur at popular nightclubs and bars, often leading to [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault).

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* don't leave drinks unattended
* don't accept drinks from strangers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare, and protests are generally peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. 

Avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.
