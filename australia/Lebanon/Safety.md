# Safety

#### Security situation

We continue to advise do not travel to Lebanon due to the volatile security situation and the risk of it deteriorating with little notice.

The security situation remains dangerous. Although a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hizballah was announced on 26 November 2024, Israeli military operations and airstrikes in Beirut, southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley could take place at any time. Australians in Lebanon should avoid known or suspected areas of military activity.

The conflict could escalate quickly or spread to other areas in Lebanon with little notice. This could affect your ability to move to safety. Australians in Lebanon should be prepared to shelter in place for an extended period. Make sure you have enough supplies, including food, water, medicine, radio, torches and batteries. Keep your identity documents, including your passport, handy. See our [advice on armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/theres-armed-conflict).

Some commercial airlines have suspended their services to Beirut International Airport. Flight cancellations and disruptions could occur with little or no notice. Beirut airport could close without notice, and you may be unable to leave for an extended period. The Australian Government may not be able to assist you to leave.

Significant military action has taken place in Beirut, southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, including rocket, missile and drone attacks, as well as airstrikes. The conflict could resume and escalate quickly. This could affect your ability to move to safety. Avoid areas where military activity may occur.

To be well prepared to leave quickly, make sure you have:

* up-to-date travel documentation
* passports for children born in Lebanon
* current passports for family members travelling with you
* resolved any visa overstay issues with General Security
* any visas your family may require for onwards travel
* any medications you may need while travelling

If violence increases, roads and highways could become blocked. This includes routes to airports and borders.

Follow the advice of local authorities, including alerts to seek shelter. Monitor local media for updates. 

If you need emergency consular assistance, contact the Australian Government's Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 62613305 (from overseas) or 1300 555 135 (in Australia).

Be extra cautious. The security situation is unpredictable and is affected by events including:

* clashes across the Lebanese/Israeli border
* clashes along the Lebanese/Syrian border
* the threat of terrorist attacks
* ongoing economic crisis, political and sectarian tensions

The ongoing crisis has reduced Lebanese law enforcement capacity.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

Political changes in the region and international developments may prompt large demonstrations or violence. Planned and spontaneous demonstrations can take place.

Anti-government protests occur. Protests may target key institutions and sites, including banks. Some can be large and escalate into violent clashes between protesters and security forces.

Authorities use various measures to break up crowds, including:

* water cannons
* tear gas
* live ammunition

These measures have resulted in injuries.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent, including the use of weapons. You could be caught in violence directed at others.

During civil unrest and times of heightened tensions:

* avoid all crowds, protests and demonstrations
* pay close attention to your personal security
* monitor the media and other sources for news on planned and possible actions
* avoid areas where violence has occurred or is likely to occur
* plan your activities to avoid potential unrest on days of national significance
* be prepared to change your travel plans in case of disruptions

If you're in an area affected by clashes:

* stay indoors and away from windows and balconies
* follow the advice of local authorities

Stay indoors during celebratory gunfire, which has caused casualties, and often happens during and after political speeches, weddings, funerals as well as religious and new year holidays.

If transport disruptions affect your travel plans, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Beirut

In times of civil unrest, avoid areas of Beirut where protests are known to occur.

In Beirut, protests sometimes close main highways. Burning of tyres to block main roads is common. Groups protest against:

* government policies
* the security environment
* the deteriorating social and economic situation
* the presence of Syrian refugees in Lebanon

Civil unrest can affect the highways between central Beirut and the international airport. Armed clashes have occurred in some areas of Beirut.

#### Southern suburbs (Dahiyeh region) of Beirut

Don't go to the Dahiyeh region.

This area does not include the main airport highway.

Security in the area is still unstable. You may be caught up in violent attacks between armed groups.

#### Palestinian refugee camps

Don't visit Palestinian refugee camps in any part of Lebanon.

Extremist groups operate inside camps. The security situation could deteriorate without warning.

The Lebanese state has no formal security presence in the camps. Armed clashes between rival groups happen. Violent crime is common.

Also avoid areas around the camps when there's heightened tension or armed clashes. Stray ammunition has caused casualties.

#### Tripoli and northern Lebanon

Don't go to Tripoli's Jabal Mohsen and Bab-al-Tabbaneh neighbourhoods. The risk of civil unrest remains high and can turn violent.

Lebanese authorities say extremists have taken refuge in northern Lebanon, including throughout the Akkar district.

#### North-eastern Beka'a Valley

Don't go to the north-eastern Beka'a Valley region, extending east and north from Rayak. This includes:

* Hermel-Baalbek region
* the towns Arsal, El Qaa and Ras Baalbek

Clashes between Lebanese security forces and militants, as well as Israeli strikes, are possible.

#### Other parts of the Beka'a Valley

Take extra care in the Beka'a valley, south of Zahle and Rayak, where the security environment is uncertain.

#### Regions within 5km of the Syrian border

Don't travel within 5km of the border with Syria, including:

* north of the Halba-Qoubaiyat Road, northern Akkar
* Arsal
* Hermel Wadi Khaled
* the Golan Heights
* Shebaa Farms

Border clashes and violent incidents between Lebanese security forces and Syria-based groups, as well as airstrikes, occur in these areas.

#### Southern Lebanon

Don't travel to areas south of the city of Sidon (Saida). 

Military action could occur and escalate quickly. This could affect your ability to move to safety. There are also landmines and unexploded ordnance.

Avoid crowds and large gatherings. You could be caught up in violence directed at others.

Although the Lebanese Armed Forces and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) are present in southern Lebanon, the situation could change quickly.

Israeli forces occupy large portions of the southern border. Tensions remain high in the surrounding region.

You could be caught up in violence directed at others.

Avoid areas where military activity may occur. Be ready to leave at short notice.

Don't visit the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein El-Hilweh. There are ongoing clashes between rival groups, including the use of heavy weapons and snipers. Many people have been killed or injured. Lebanese authorities have limited capacity to impose law and order.

Stray ammunition has caused casualties.

#### Terrorism

There's a threat of terrorism in Lebanon. Attacks could occur anytime and anywhere, including in Beirut, Tripoli and areas close to the Syrian border. Tactics used by terrorists can include car bombing, suicide bombing and rocket fire. Foreigners may be targeted.

Security services are on a high state of alert and continue to carry out operations to prevent attacks.

If you notice a security operation is underway, leave the area straight away.

Targets associated with the Lebanese Government include:

* government institutions, senior politicians, and officials
* the Lebanese Armed Forces
* infrastructure such as airports and public building

Terrorists may also target areas frequented by foreigners, such as:

* buildings associated with embassies, foreign companies, and international organisations
* schools and places of worship
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars
* shopping centres, markets and grocery stores
* public transport
* promenades, cinemas, outdoor recreation events and other tourist areas

Extremists have increased attacks in the lead-up to and on days of national and religious significance.

Always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

Report any suspicious items or activities to police.

To reduce your risks:

* take official warnings seriously
* consider the likely level of security at known terrorist targets when planning your activities
* monitor the media for threats
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks.

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This also applies if you're evacuated from a building for safety or security reasons.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, criminal motives, and family disputes. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.   
   
To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.   
   
Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

Crime in Lebanon has increased due to the declining economic situation.

It could include:

* vehicle crime
* petty theft such as bag snatching (including by motorbike riders)
* home break-ins and armed [robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) (especially at banks)
* physical and sexual assault

Always be aware of your surroundings.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Lebanon experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

Lebanon is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone.

[Bush and forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occur in the summer months (July to September), especially in heavily forested areas. Avoid fire-affected areas. Monitor the media for updates.

Sand and dust storms are common. They may pose health risks, especially to people with breathing problems.

If a natural disaster or severe weather happens:

* monitor the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
