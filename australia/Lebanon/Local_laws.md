# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Crimes under Lebanese laws may not be considered offences in Australia. Religious law has the same standing as civil law, which incorporates family law, marriage, divorce and custody.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Family law

All family law matters are based on local religious laws. This includes child custody and divorce decisions.

If you're involved in custody or other family disputes, speak to a lawyer before you leave Australia. Ask for advice on how religious law may affect your family circumstances.

Lebanon has not signed the [Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction](https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=24). There may be significant delays in returning a child abducted by a parent to Lebanon back to Australia.

Australian citizens can be prevented from leaving Lebanon if there are pending family court matters.

Authorities have stopped Australians and Australian-Lebanese dual nationals, including mothers with children, from leaving Lebanon. Relatives have legally placed border alerts ('stop orders') where there are pending family court matters. Overturning stop orders can be a time consuming and complicated process.

The Australian Government can't prevent or overturn a stop order on an Australian citizen.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include mandatory jail terms.

#### Other laws

Serious crimes, such as murder and treason, may attract the death penalty.

Access to some areas of Lebanon is restricted.

Authorities may detain you and take your camera if you photograph or film:

* military personnel or facilities
* government buildings
* major civilian infrastructure (such as power stations)

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relations are illegal in Lebanon. Penalties include jail terms of up to one year.

There's been an increase in anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric in the community. Some incidents of targeted harassment have occurred.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

Australians may be charged under Australian law if they take part in conflict in other countries.

#### Dual citizenship

Lebanon recognises dual nationality. However, Lebanese citizenship takes precedence over the second nationality.

If you're a dual national, Lebanese authorities will treat you as a Lebanese citizen. This may significantly limit the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can provide if you're arrested or detained.

If you're a dual citizen re-entering Lebanon on your Lebanese passport or identity document, make sure:

* your Lebanese documentation is up to date
* you meet all entry requirements

* [Dual nationals](/before-you-go/who-you-are/dual-nationals "Advice for dual nationals")

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are modest in parts of Lebanon, particularly at religious sites.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

Public displays of affection may cause offence in conservative and religious areas.

Some hotels ask for proof of marriage before renting rooms to couples. Hotels may refuse you accommodation if you can't provide proof.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Lebanon. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public, or in front of people who are fasting.
