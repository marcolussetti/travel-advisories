Australians in Lebanon should avoid known or suspected areas of military activity.

* Ensure your travel documents are up to date. Ensure you have valid passports for children born in Lebanon and for all family members travelling with you.
* Due to the current security situation and the risk of it deteriorating with little notice, the Australian Embassy has temporarily suspended all non-essential in-country travel outside Beirut for Australian officials and their families posted to Lebanon.
* Avoid areas where military activity is ongoing or may occur. GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Lebanon. See our [advice on ‘Armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/theres-armed-conflict)’.
* An increased threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region and ongoing military action in the Occupied Palestinian Territories could lead to increased tensions in other locations in the Middle East. This may result in travel disruptions, including airspace closures, flight cancellations and diversions.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may occur, and localised security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Terrorist attacks could occur anytime and anywhere, including in Beirut. Attacks involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs), small arms and kidnappings have occurred in Lebanon. Extremists may target foreigners. Take safety precautions. Always be alert to possible threats and avoid potential targets.
* Large protests happen and can turn violent. Tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition may be used. Avoid large public gatherings. Celebratory and warning gunfire often occurs and has caused casualties. Stay inside during celebratory and warning gunfire or if you're caught in civil unrest. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* There's a high threat of armed conflict in southern Lebanon. Israeli forces occupy large portions of the southern border. Tensions remain high in the surrounding region. Avoid areas of military conflict.

### Health

* Shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies could occur without notice. Make sure you have enough medication with you, including if you need to depart Lebanon.
* The public health care system is limited. Most reputable hospitals are private and expensive. You'll probably have to pay up front.
* Health risks include possible water contamination, waterborne illnesses and air pollution caused by burning waste and backup generators. Drink only boiled or bottled water from bottles with sealed lids.

### Local laws

* Religious law and civil law are treated equally. All family law matters are based on local religious laws. Stop-orders that prevent you from leaving Lebanon may arise from family disputes. If you're involved in divorce, custody or other family disputes, speak to a lawyer before you leave Australia.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties are severe and include jail terms.
* Serious crimes like murder and treason may result in the death penalty.
* Lebanon recognises dual nationality. However, Lebanese authorities treat Lebanese dual nationals as Lebanese citizens. This may limit our ability to help you if you're arrested or detained.
* Standards of dress and behaviour are modest in parts of Lebanon, particularly at religious sites.  Public displays of affection may cause offence.
* Be careful when taking photos. Photographing military personnel or sites, government buildings and major civil infrastructure, such as power stations and other installations is illegal.

### Travel

* You should not travel to Lebanon at this time.
* If you decide to travel to Lebanon despite our advice, you can get a tourist visa on arrival in Lebanon. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Lebanon for the latest details.
* Always carry ID. You'll need to show it at road checkpoints. Lebanese General Security (border control) will check your name against a database of people wanted for or convicted of an offence. If your name matches an entry, you may be detained. You'll have to prove that the record doesn't relate to you. Carry supporting documents, such as a copy of your birth certificate or other official documents.
* GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Lebanon. This can disrupt navigational apps and devices.
