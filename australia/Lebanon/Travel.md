#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If you decide to travel to Lebanon despite our advice, you can get a tourist visa on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Lebanese embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/111) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### Border measures

Land border crossings between Lebanon and Syria have witnessed clashes and violent incidents between Lebanese security forces and Syria-based groups, as well as airstrikes. Due to instability in Syria, land border crossings from Syria to Lebanon may close at short notice. 

For measures regarding travel between Syria and Lebanon, contact Lebanese and Syrian authorities.

#### Other formalities

#### Travel to Israel

It's against Lebanese law to travel to Israel.

If there's evidence that you've travelled to Israel, or intend to, you will be refused entry to Lebanon and deported. You may be arrested and imprisoned. Evidence includes:

* Israeli exit or entry stamps in your passport
* Egyptian or Jordanian stamps from border crossings with Israel
* travel itineraries or tickets that include Israel as a destination
* souvenirs from Israel
* airline tags on your bags
* SIM cards, literature, or other items with obvious links to Israel

Authorities can hold anyone for questioning for several days and then deport them.

#### Border alerts

Lebanese General Security (border control) checks all traveller names on arrival and departure against a database of border alerts ('stop orders').

Border alerts are raised if there are pending court cases or warrants for people:

* who are wanted for an offence in Lebanon
* who have been convicted of an offence in Lebanon
* with pending family court matters (see [Local laws](#local-laws))

If your name matches an entry in the database, authorities may detain you. You'll have to prove the record doesn't relate to you.

Carry supporting identity documents.

Travellers have been detained due to cases of mistaken identity.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Both the USD and the Lebanese Pound (also known as the Lebanese Lira) are accepted throughout Lebanon.

Currency exchange facilities and ATMs are widely available in Beirut and other large cities. Daily withdrawal limits and high withdrawal fees may apply. It can be difficult to access smaller denominations of USD.

Credit and debit cards are not widely accepted. Make sure you have access to enough hard currency cash during your stay. Contact your bank and monitor media reports before you travel to Lebanon.

#### Local travel

#### Shortages

Fuel and power shortages frequently occur, disrupting public water supply and telecommunication networks, including mobile and internet.

Expect delays and closures at service stations during fuel shortages. Violence and security incidents have occurred at fuel distribution and storage sites.

Public and private sector industrial strikes occur occasionally, which may affect essential services, including telecommunications and the banking sector.

Shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies can occur without notice.

Monitor the media for updates on changes that may affect your safety and access to essential services.

#### Road travel

If you plan to drive in Lebanon, you should hold an International Drivers Permit.

Armed security is present throughout Lebanon, including at road checkpoints.

Always carry ID. Follow the advice of security personnel.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* snow and ice in winter
* traffic conditions
* poor local driving habits
* lack of streetlights and functioning traffic lights

There are many unexploded ordinances throughout Lebanon, especially south of the Litani River, including:

* cluster bombs
* landmines

Minefields aren't always clearly marked.

To protect yourself from landmines:

* ask local residents for advice
* stay on sealed roads
* avoid walking or driving cross-country

Roads may be blocked during demonstrations and civil unrest. This includes routes to and from the airport and border crossings.

GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Lebanon, disrupting navigational apps.

#### Taxis

Don't use service (shared) taxis or taxis hailed on the street, especially late at night.

Australian Embassy staff in Beirut have been advised to use Allo Taxi.

#### Air travel

An increased threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region and ongoing military action in the Occupied Palestinian Territories could lead to increased tensions in other locations in the Middle East. This may also result in airspace closures, flight cancellations, diversions and other travel disruptions.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

For more information, refer to [air travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/air-travel) and check with airlines before booking. Flight paths are subject to change. Check with your airline or travel agent for updates and flight options.

#### Adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes for adventure activities.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
