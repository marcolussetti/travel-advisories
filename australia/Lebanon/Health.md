#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars upfront for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

#### Medication

Shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies can occur without notice.

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Lebanon. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicationÂ is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Health risks include possible water contamination, waterborne illnesses and air pollution caused by burning waste and exhaust fumes from diesel generators. Drink only boiled or bottled water from bottles with sealed lids.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities and care in many of Lebanon's large private hospitals is generally as good as in Australia. However, the public health system doesn't work in the same way. Most reputable hospitals are private and expensive.

The ability of some hospitals to provide medical care may be impacted by the economic situation, shortages of medical supplies and frequent power cuts.

Doctors usually accept upfront cash payment for services. Treatment can be expensive.

Before treating patients, hospitals usually require a guarantee of payment such as:

* confirmed travel insurance with medical cover
* an up-front deposit
