#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

In Azerbaijan, many painkillers and other prescription narcotics available in Australia are subject to strict restrictions. You should avoid carrying or shipping these medications. If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Azerbaijan. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

For more information, contact the Azerbaijan Embassy in Canberra: [canberra@mission.mfa.gov.az](mailto:canberra@mission.mfa.gov.az).

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are adequate in private hospitals in Baku.

Services in government hospitals and other areas of the country are often limited. Shortages of basic medical supplies are common.

Serious illness or injury may require evacuation to Turkiye or Western Europe. Make sure your insurance covers this. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Doctors and hospitals will usually need up-front payment before treatment.

Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill is likely to be significantly below the standards available in Australia.
