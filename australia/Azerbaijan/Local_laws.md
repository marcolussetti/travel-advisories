# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They can include long prison sentences and heavy fines.

#### Other laws

Always carry your passport and visa. Routine police checks in public and tourist spots are common.

You could be fined or jailed if you don't show a valid travel document when asked.

In Azerbaijan, it's illegal to:

* visit or take photos of military equipment and sites
* take photos of military personnel
* buy antique or cultural artefacts without a permit
* export antiques or cultural artefacts without an official certificate and receipt of purchase
* convert a person to another faith

Export rules apply to religious objects, carpets, artworks and caviar. Check with local authorities before you export any items.

If you're suspected of a crime, even a minor crime, you may have to stay in Azerbaijan while your case is investigated. This may last for several months.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Azerbaijan doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual Australian-Azerbaijani citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/node/44).

Azerbaijan citizens may need to do military service. If you're an Australian-Azerbaijani dual national, get advice on your service obligations from the [embassy or consulate of Azerbaijan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/17). Do this well before you travel.

#### Local customs

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Azerbaijan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

#### Dress and behaviour

Dress standards can be conservative outside of Baku. Public displays of affection may not be welcome. Dress conservatively. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are legal but not widely accepted.

Intolerance, discrimination and violence towards LGBTQIA+ people happens in Azerbaijan. Avoid public displays of affection.
