## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas and attractions or other places frequented by foreigners. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities. There's an increased threat of attacks against Israel and Israeli interests.
* Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding region can have unmarked landmines. There is limited infrastructure. If, despite our advice, you travel to these areas, get professional security advice.
* Protests can turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings and exercise heightened caution in locations where foreigners may gather.
* Violent crime is rare in Azerbaijan, but foreigners have reported serious crimes, including home burglaries, robbery and assault. Be alert when walking after dark, including near hotels and residential areas. Don't use unofficial taxis. Don't use ATMs on the street.
