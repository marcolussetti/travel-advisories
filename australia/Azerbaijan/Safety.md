# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas, attractions, or other places frequented by foreigners. There's an increased threat of attacks against Israel and Israeli interests.

Exercise heightened caution in locations where foreigners and large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there is an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Police sometimes use force to break up demonstrations.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid public protests and rallies
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Conflict zones

The region of Nagorno-Karabakh is now under the control of Azerbaijan following military action in September 2023.

We recommend you do not travel to Armenia-Azerbaijan border areas or Nagorno-Karabakh.

Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding region can have unmarked landmines. There is limited infrastructure. If, despite our advice, you travel to these areas, get professional security advice.

#### Crime

#### Serious crime

Violent crime is rare in Azerbaijan.

Foreigners have reported serious crime, including home burglaries, [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault").

Be careful walking after dark, including near hotels and in residential areas.

#### Drink and food spiking

Watch out for drink and food spiking. This can occur in bars and nightclubs in Baku. You're at higher risk of theft if you get drugged.

Never accept food or drinks from strangers or new acquaintances.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty crime and scams

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, can happen. Take care at outdoor markets and on public transport, including the Baku Metro.

Travellers and expats have reported thieves posing as police officers who demand money. Ask to follow the police officer to the nearest station to pay the fine.

Avoid using unofficial taxis. Ask your hotel to arrange one, or go to an official taxi rank.

Use ATMs in controlled areas, like banks, shops and shopping centres. Avoid ATMs that open onto the street, especially at night.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.  
  
Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.
