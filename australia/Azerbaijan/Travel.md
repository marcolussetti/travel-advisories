#### Visas and Border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need a visa to visit Azerbaijan.

You can apply for an electronic visa (e-visa) valid for 90 days. You can do this online through [Azerbaijan's Official Electronic Visa Portal](https://evisa.gov.az/en/). Allow at least 3 business days for processing a standard e-visa and 3 hours for an urgent e-visa (additional service fee applies).

If you don't abide by your visa or permit terms, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering Azerbaijan.

Ensure your passport is valid for at least 3 months from the expiry date of the e-visa.

#### Visa extensions

You can apply to extend or renew your visa through Azerbaijan's [State Migration Service](https://migration.gov.az/). Keep a copy of your passport and existing visa while your application is being processed. The Ministry of Interior Police may ask to see your documents at any time. See [Local laws](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/laws ).

#### Border crossing with Iran

For Australians travelling from Iran, Azerbaijan authorities have reopened the crossing on its southern border at Astara for 'exceptional' crossing by third-country nationals.

You will still need a visa to enter Azerbaijan. You can get a visa online: <https://evisa.gov.az/en/>

To depart Iran at the border, we must register your details with Azerbaijan authorities to get a border crossing code (for Australian passport holders). This is different to the visa. Contact the Australian Embassy in Türkiye ([consular.ankara@dfat.gov.au](mailto:consular.ankara@dfat.gov.au)). It can take up to 48 hours or longer for a border crossing code to be issued by authorities. Due to 26-27 June being a public holiday in Azerbaijan, new applications will not be processed until next week. If you have a crossing code, we have been advised you can cross the Azerbaijan border during the holiday.

You will need to provide your full name, passport number, your e-visa for Azerbaijan, and contact details for all individuals seeking to transit. If possible, send a scan of your passport biodata page.

Some travellers have been able to cross into Azerbaijan at Astara without this code. Waiting times can vary significantly. Internet and telephone connectivity in Iran, including at the Azerbaijan border, can be very poor.

#### Registering with the police

If you plan to stay in Azerbaijan for over 15 days, you must register with the State Migration Service online (registration upon place of stay) or at regional migration departments ([www.migration.gov.az](http://www.migration.gov.az/)), even if you have a 90-day visa. Do this within 10 days of arrival. If you don't, you'll be fined.

You may not be able to leave Azerbaijan until you pay the fine and get an exit permit from the [State Migration Service](http://www.migration.gov.az/index.php?section=012&subsection=111%E2%9F%AA=en).

#### Travel via Nagorno-Karabakh

If your passport has visas or stamps from Nagorno-Karabakh, you could be refused entry into Azerbaijan. Land borders are currently closed except for freight.

#### Travel via neighbouring countries

Travel restrictions may apply to Australians travelling overland from Azerbaijan to neighbouring countries.

Check the nearest [embassy or consulate of Azerbaijan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/17) for any travel restrictions. You'll also need to check the rules of neighbouring countries.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/node/44).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Azerbaijan's currency is the Azerbaijani Manat (AZN).

Declare any amount of foreign currency on arrival. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can export up to $US10,000 without documentation. Contact the [embassy or consulate of Azerbaijan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/17) for details.

US dollars and euros are also common. You can change notes in good condition for local currency.

Credit cards are becoming more common in major cities. They may not be accepted in smaller restaurants and stores.

Traveller's cheques aren't often accepted, except in major hotels, some restaurants and banks.

ATMs are available in major cities.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Azerbaijan with a current Australian driver's licence. Foreigners staying for more than one month may need to get a local driver's licence through ASAN Service Offices.

You may also need an International Driving Permit (IDP) for travel and car insurance. Check with your insurer and car provider before you drive.

#### Road travel

Driving in Azerbaijan can be dangerous. Common dangers include:

* roads and vehicles in poor condition
* drivers who ignore traffic signals and rules
* high-speed crashes that cause serious injury or death
* rural roads without lights or road signs
* sharing the road with pedestrians, slow-moving farm equipment and livestock

Right-hand drive cars are illegal in Azerbaijan.

It's illegal to drive with a blood alcohol reading above 0%.

Before you drive in Azerbaijan:

* check if your travel insurance will cover you
* get to know local road rules

Look out for pedestrians, livestock and farm equipment when you drive, particularly in rural areas.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and authorised limousines. It's best to get your hotel to arrange a taxi for you.

Avoid flagging down taxis in the street.

Always use an official taxi rank.

Sit in the back seat rather than the front.

#### Public transport

Public transport can be overcrowded, especially buses. It may not meet Australian safety standards.

Take care of your belongings because petty crime occurs.

#### Rail travel

The Baku Metro has standard safety equipment and procedures. Metro signs are in Azerbaijani.

To reduce your risks if you travel by overland train:

* secure your valuables
* don't leave the compartment unattended
* lock the door of your compartment from the inside

#### Air travel

Before you travel on Azerbaijan's domestic airlines, be aware that:

* planes may not meet international standards for maintenance
* overbooking and overcrowding is common
* cancellations and delays can occur without explanation

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Azerbaijan's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/) with the Aviation Safety Network.
