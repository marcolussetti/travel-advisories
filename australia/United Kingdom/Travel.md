#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian government can't help you if you don't.

If you're travelling to the UK as a tourist for less than 6 months, you usually won't need a visa.

If you're travelling to the UK for other purposes, seek guidance from the [UK's Visa and Immigration Service](https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk) on obtaining a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [UK High Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-canberra) for details about visas, currency and customs. 

#### Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)

From 8 January, Australians who don't currently need a visa for short stays or don't already have a UK immigration status will need an ETA to travel to or transit through the UK.  

An ETA permits multiple visits to the UK for stays of up to 6 months at a time over 2 years or until the holder's passport expires, whichever is sooner.

An ETA does not guarantee entry to the UK.

#### Online Immigration Status (eVisa)

UK Visas and Immigration is replacing physical documents (such as Biometric Residence Permits) with online immigration status records – known as eVisas.

The documents being replaced are:

* [biometric residence permits (BRP)](https://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits)
* [biometric residence cards (BRC)](https://www.gov.uk/uk-residence-card)
* passport endorsements, such as indefinite leave to enter wet ink stamps
* vignette stickers in passports, such as entry clearance or visa vignettes.

For more information, see [Online Immigration Status (eVisa)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/online-immigration-status-evisa) 

The UK can refuse entry without a visa if they think you're trying to enter for reasons other than tourism. You'll need a visa if you plan to do [paid or unpaid work](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/volunteering), [volunteer](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/volunteering) or [get married](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/marriage). Arrange this before you travel.

Australian Government officials can't help you change your UK visa status.

#### Visa scams

Travellers have been scammed by private online visa services and travel agents.

Only apply for your visa through the [Visas and immigration - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration) website.

#### Other formalities

You can usually use eGates on arrival in the UK (free of charge) if you:

* have a biometric symbol on the cover of your passport; and
* are aged 10+ with an Australian ePassport (10 to 17 year olds must be accompanied by an adult).

You don't need to complete a landing card.

You must see a Border Force officer and get your passport stamped if you're coming to the UK with a [Temporary Work - Creative Worker Certificate of Sponsorship](https://www.gov.uk/creative-worker-visa) for short-term assignments (up to 3 months).

Read the[Guide to faster travel through the UK border](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coming-to-the-uk/faster-travel-through-the-uk-border), as these requirements can change at short notice.

#### Security

UK airports have extensive security screening. Allow extra time if you're flying to or transiting through the UK. Check [UK Department of Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-uk-aviation-security) for details.

Check [UK Visas and Immigration](https://www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions/overview) for details. Also, check the UK's hand luggage rules.

Contact your airline or travel provider for more details.

#### Brexit

The UK and the EU provide updated guidance on the implications of Brexit for issues such as travel, residency, education and employment. The latest information can be found on the websites of the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/brexit) and the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit_en).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Pound Sterling (GBP).

ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used. Contactless payment is widely accepted.

If you're travelling to or from a non-European Union (EU) country, declare cash of more than 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You may have to pay a penalty if you don't declare this cash.

Severe weather can affect airline, bus and train services. Check with local transport providers for up-to-date details.

#### Driving permit

You can drive a car or motorbike for up to 12 months. You need a full Australian licence for the relevant vehicle. After 12 months, you'll need to get a UK driver's licence. An International Driving Permit isn't required.

If riding a motorcycle, always wear a helmet.

#### Road travel

Road and safety conditions in the UK are comparable to those in Australia. Follow the advice from local authorities.
