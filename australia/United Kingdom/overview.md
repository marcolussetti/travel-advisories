* Islamic extremism, extreme right-wing ideology and the status of Northern Ireland contribute to the threat. Always be alert to terrorism. Take official warnings seriously.
* Avoid areas where protests and riots are occurring due to the potential for disruption and violence. Monitor the media and follow the instructions of local authorities.
* Crimes such as passport theft, pickpocketing, mobile phone and bag snatching, and muggings are common, particularly in summer.  Take care to protect your belongings on public transport, in crowded tourist areas and at landmarks.
