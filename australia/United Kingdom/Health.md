#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

You may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care if you're not insured.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered).

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and [mental health](/before-you-go/health/mental-health "Managing your mental health") before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you need counselling, the Samaritans provide private phone support. You can call 116 123 (UK free call) 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring [medication](/before-you-go/health/medications "Medication and medical equipment"), check if it's legal in the UK. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating the following:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

Check the UK [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs) for advice about medication.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is similar to that of Australia.

Call the [National Health Service (NHS)](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx) on 111 to find your nearest GP surgery or hospital.

If you need urgent medical care, go to your nearest hospital.

#### Accessing NHS medical services

There's a reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and the UK.

Some GP and hospital treatments are free if you're in the UK for a short visit.

Check the [Department of Human Services](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/medicare/reciprocal-health-care-agreements) to find out what's covered. You'll need to prove you're eligible.

If you stay for over 6 months, you'll pay an [Immigration Health Surcharge](https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application), which will be charged when you apply for your visa.

Your details will be shared with the NHS when your visa is approved, allowing you access to medical care.

When you access healthcare in the UK, you may need to:

* provide your biometric residence permit if you have one
* [prove your status online](https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status) using a share code if you have a digital immigration status.

There may be delays in accessing medical treatment through the NHS.

The NHS won't cover the cost of a medical evacuation, which can be very expensive. Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave Australia.
