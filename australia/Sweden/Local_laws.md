# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46), but we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Children

It's illegal to use physical punishment against children in Sweden, including threatening a child with physical punishment.

If you use or threaten physical punishment against your child, local authorities can take custody of your child and prosecute you.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, even for small amounts, include heavy fines and jail.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Sweden recognises dual nationality.

The Swedish Government has reinstated compulsory military service for citizens who are 18 years of age, starting with those born between 1999 and 2000.

If you're a dual Australian-Swedish national, check your military service obligations with the [Swedish Defence Conscription and Assessment Agency](https://www.pliktverket.se/om-myndigheten/in-english).
