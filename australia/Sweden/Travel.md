#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Sweden is part of the European Union (EU) and the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") and has abolished passport and border controls within the Schengen area.

When you first enter the Schengen area, get an entry stamp from border control on your passport.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy of Sweden](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/190) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Sweden](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/190) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

Carry a valid passport to enter or leave Sweden. Do this even if you're travelling from another Schengen country.

Always carry your passport. If you have one, carry your Swedish residency permit. Authorities may ask for proof of identity.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Sweden's official currency is the Swedish Krona (SEK).

Some businesses no longer accept cash.

Declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Sweden and any non-European Union (EU) country. This includes all forms of currency, not just cash.

You'll be fined if you don't declare it or give the wrong information on entry or exit.

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Sweden's roads are usually in very good condition.

Roads can be dangerous in winter due to ice. Long periods of darkness can make it hard to see. Accidents with wildlife are common.

Get details on road conditions from the [Swedish Transport Agency (Swedish).](https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/sv/vagtrafik/)

Vehicle headlights must always be on.

Winter tyres must be fitted:

* from 1 December or when it first snows
* until 31 March or later if roads are still icy

The legal blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0.02%. Penalties for drink driving are severe and can lead to a prison sentence. Police may give you a fine even if the alcohol limit in your blood is lower than 0.02%, depending on your capability to control your vehicle.

There's a congestion tax for vehicles entering and exiting Stockholm and Gothenburg at certain hours of the day.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike or quad bike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Public transport

Public transport, including buses and trains, is generally reliable and safe.

Taxis are widely available but may be expensive. Use only officially marked taxis.

Taxi fares in Sweden are not regulated. Fares may vary and have no upper limit. Consult information boards at airports. Always confirm the rates before your journey.
