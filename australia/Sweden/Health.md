#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Check the status of your medicine with the [Swedish Medical Products Agency](http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/english/).

You can bring a 3-month supply of medicine for personal use to Sweden.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Health risks in Sweden are similar to those in Australia.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) and [Lyme disease](https://www.1177.se/en/Halland/other-languages/other-languages/symtomsjukdom---andra-sprak/biten-av-fasting---andra-sprak/) are risks. Ticks are very common in country areas, especially in some coastal regions and around major lakes. They're active from March to November. Prior vaccination is recommended.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* always use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* avoid peak activity times, dawn and dusk

To reduce your risk of tick-borne disease:

* check your body for ticks during and after visiting forests
* remove ticks as soon as possible, making sure to remove the whole tick
* monitor the tick bite for any signs of infection

#### Medical care

Swedish medical facilities have standards similar to those in Australia.

Emergency services are limited in remote areas.

The main hospitals are located in the Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö regions. English is widely spoken.

Australia has a healthcare agreement with Sweden. It's called the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA). If you're in Sweden for less than 90 days, you can access emergency medical services for free.

It doesn't give you the same coverage as Medicare in Australia and doesn't cover the following:

* ongoing treatment of pre-existing health conditions
* medical evacuation
* prescription medicine
* elective surgery

Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

You must present an Australian passport and a valid Medicare card to get emergency treatment. You may also need to refer to the RHCA.

If you can't show your passport and Medicare card, you may need to pay the same costs that apply to non-residents.

The RHCA does not replace the need for private travel health insurance.
