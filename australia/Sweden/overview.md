## Overview

### Safety

* Swedish authorities assess that Sweden is a prioritised target for terrorist attacks, with increasing threats by violent Islamist groups. The current threat level is 'high threat' or level 4 out of 5, meaning the probability of an attack is high.
* Terrorist attacks can occur at any time. Maintain high vigilance in public spaces and take official warnings seriously. Avoid crowds, be aware of your surroundings, and stay i[nformed](https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/terrorism).
* Petty crime is common. Take care in hotels and restaurants. Violent crime is rare. However, gangs and organised crime do occur. Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings.
* Winter is extremely cold, with heavy snowfall and severe transport delays. Public facilities can also be interrupted. Check the media, emergency information from Swedish authorities and other local sources for the latest details.
