#### Terrorism

Sweden’s [domestic terror alert](https://sakerhetspolisen.se/ovriga-sidor/other-languages/english-engelska/press-room/news/news/2025-05-23-decrease-in-the-terrorist-threat-level-from-high-to-elevated.html) is now at ‘elevated’ or level 3 out of 5. An elevated threat level still includes the possibility that a terrorist attack could occur.

Terrorist attacks can occur anywhere and at any time. Maintain high vigilance in public spaces and take official warnings seriously. Avoid crowds, be aware of your surroundings, and stay [informed](https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/terrorism).

Gathering sites, such as places of worship, could be targeted. Use caution when in and around any diplomatic facilities. Report suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.

​In recent years, terrorists have attacked some European cities. Targets have included:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

European security services have also stopped several planned attacks.

Areas attracting large groups of people are also targets. These include:

* places popular with foreigners, such as Christmas markets
* religious holiday events
* large political events, such as protests
* other public celebrations

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* avoid places that could be terrorist targets
* consider the level of security around you
* avoid visiting at peak times
* have a clear exit plan if there's a security incident
* report any suspicious actions or items to the police
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Monitor local media for updates and other sources for possible unrest.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To protect yourself in periods of unrest:

* avoid crowds, protests and demonstrations
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

While violent incidents are rare in tourist locations, you should still be cautious. There are incidents of gang-related violent crime in Sweden, including gun violence and bombings, mainly in the three largest cities:

* Stockholm
* Gothenburg
* Malmö

Always be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. In Gothenburg and Malmö, gang-related violence does occur more frequently in the city centre, especially at night.

Pickpocketing and bag snatching are common and on the rise in Stockholm, especially in the Old Town (Gamla Stan)

Criminals may work in teams. One distracts the victim while the other carries out the theft.

Take care in hotels and restaurants. Thieves can steal bags and purses when you're distracted.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.
