#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Sierra Leone.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Sierra Leone](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/178) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Entry to Sierra Leone

All inbound and outbound travellers from internationalairports in Sierra Leone are required to pay a US$25 airport security fee prior to travelling. Payment can be made [online](https://securipass.sl), via Orange Money, Afrimoney, at any branch of United Bank for Africa (UBA) or Sierra Leone Commercial Bank (SLCB).

Border closures are possible with short notice.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Sierra Leone. You may be asked to show your certificate when you leave.

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to travel to other countries after visiting Sierra Leone.

#### Other formalities

#### Dual nationals

If you're an Australian-Sierra Leonean dual national, you must show proof that you've paid taxes on money earned in Sierra Leone.

If you don't, you won't be allowed to leave the country.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Leone (SLL).

Euros and US dollars are the easiest foreign currencies to exchange.

Only exchange money at banks and official exchange bureaus.

The economy is cash-based. There are strict rules limiting the amount of foreign cash that can be brought into the country.

Credit cards and traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted.

There aren't many ATMs in Freetown. Contact your bank to check if your cards will work in Sierra Leone.

#### Local travel

#### Airport transfers

All transport options between Lungi airport and Freetown carry risks. This includes travel by:

* helicopter
* ferry service
* private boat service
* hovercraft
* road

Safety and security risks include:

* overcrowding
* poor maintenance
* lack of basic safety equipment
* crime

Risks increase after dark. You should avoid travelling at night, including taking public transport.

Accommodation options if you arrive at Lungi at night are very limited.

To reduce your risks:

* stay overnight at Lungi and transfer to Freetown the next morning
* arrange airport accommodation or transfers before you travel
* try to arrive during daylight hours

#### Driving permit

You can drive for one month with

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

After that, you'll need a local licence.

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Serious accidents are very common in Sierra Leone. You should avoid travelling at night, including on public transport. Road conditions vary and only the main roads are paved outside Freetown. Road conditions may worsen during the rainy season.

There is limited assistance available from emergency services in the case of an accident. Large mobs often form at the scene of an accident and threaten the safety of the driver. Go to the nearest police station for safety, even for minor accidents.

Hazards include:

* poor driving standards
* speeding
* motorcycle taxis
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* lack of lighting on roads
* high traffic levels
* pedestrians and animals

You may have trouble at roadblocks and checkpoints, including requests for money. Unofficial checkpoints may be established by children and road repair crews requesting money, often on weekends near tourist beaches. Always carry ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers.

To stay safe on the road:

* get to know local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to possible hazards, especially at night
* keep your windows up and doors locked, even when driving
* use a well-maintained vehicle, preferably a four-wheel-drive if leaving Freetown
* be alert to groups stopping your car under false pretences
* complete your travel during daylight hours when possible
* consider travelling in a convoy

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle. Motorcycle taxis are common in Freetown but are often involved in serious accidents.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Avoid using taxis. Ask your accommodation host or tour guide for advice. Book local transport through a reputable provider.

#### Public transport

[Public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport) is limited. Use of public transport is not recommended. Safety and maintenance standards are unreliable and pickpocketing and other crime is common.

#### Sea travel

Ferry and water taxi travel is risky due to low safety standards and bad weather. Rough conditions may cause cancellations or delays during the rainy season. 

Vessels may be overcrowded and have limited life jackets and lighting. Be vigilant, particularly for pickpocketing, as petty crime is common on these vessels.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others aren't.
