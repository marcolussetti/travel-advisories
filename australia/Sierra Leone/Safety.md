#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security environment in Sierra Leone remains fluid. 

Civil unrest, demonstrations, public protests and events that draw large numbers of people can turn violent. Clashes between protestors and security forces have resulted in serious injuries and casualties in the past. Avoid demonstrations, protests and areas where large gatherings are taking place.  
  
Nationwide curfews, checkpoints and additional security measures could be implemented at short notice. Disruptions to communication networks and internet service can occur with little notice, especially during civil unrest. The telecommunications network can be unreliable, and some areas do not have mobile coverage. Follow the instructions of local authorities and monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations.

#### Crime

#### Violent and petty crime

Crime levels are high in Sierra Leone, including in Freetown.

Common crimes include:

* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* violent [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* carjacking
* pickpocketing and mugging
* bag snatching

Petty crime is increasing. It is common on the ferry to and from Lungi International Airport, near beach resorts and in bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.

Security risks increase at night. Some criminals target travellers and foreigners.

To reduce your risk of crime:

* watch your personal belongings and avoiding displaying signs of personal wealth
* avoid walking in isolated areas or going out after dark
* lock your accommodation, even when you're in it
* arrange your transport in advance
* avoid using public transport
* keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving

#### Reporting Crime

The Sierra Leone Police charge foreign nationals a fee for police reports. They will not issue a crime reference number, which is needed for most insurance claims, without a police report. Do not pay the police directly. Make your payment to the Sierra Leone Police Revenue Generation Fund account at the Bank of Sierra Leone and get a receipt.

There's no charge if you want to report a crime but don't need a crime reference number.

#### Border areas

The security situation in border areas could deteriorate rapidly. Violent clashes have occurred. Criminal gangs and smugglers operate in these areas. Border closures may occur with little notice.

#### Scams and fraud

Internet [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) come in many forms, including romance, friendship, business and job offers. These scams often come from West Africa and usually start in internet dating sites, chat rooms or via email. 

Once the online friendship develops, your friend or prospective business or marriage partner might ask you to send money to help them in a difficult situation or for an investment opportunity.

Criminals might also:

* ask to transfer large amounts of money to an overseas bank account and offer you a percentage
* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for fake government contracts
* offer to purchase precious minerals or diamonds on your behalf
* lure you to Sierra Leone for a business opportunity

In some cases, the relationship ends, and your money is gone. In other cases, you could be lured to Africa to meet your friend. You may [be kidnapped](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping), [assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault) or robbed.

Don't travel to Sierra Leone to get your money back. Some victims have been killed. 

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them
* be cautious when posting information on social media
* check your bank statements for any authorised transactions
* use ATMs located inside a bank or business

If you're the victim of a scam, get legal advice.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to public Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Swimming safety

Strong coastal currents are common and drownings occur.

There are no lifeguards or emergency services to rescue swimmers.

To reduce your risks, you should:

* get advice from locals before swimming
* avoid swimming alone
* be aware of hospital waste, including needles, on Lumley Beach

#### Climate and natural disasters

The rainy season is from May to November. Flooding may occur, and roads may be blocked.

Floods have caused mudslides, deaths and displaced large numbers of people.

Monitor weather reports and plan your travel.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") happens:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* closely monitor local media and other sources
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Power and water shortages

Power and water shortages can occur in Sierra Leone.

Blackouts can affect water availability, internet connectivity, mobile phone network coverage, fuel availability, residential security features, and food supply. 

Be prepared for blackouts: 

* have a communications plan for when there is no or limited power (landline locations, external mobile phone battery/power banks, additional charging cords, hard copies of important numbers).
* maintain several days worth of non-perishable food, drinking water, and other essential items, including medicine and first aid supplies.
* keep torches, batteries, radios and basic tools in quick-access locations.
* identify safe areas around the city, including hotels, hospitals or police stations that may not lose power.
* monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.
