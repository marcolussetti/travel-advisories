#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Sierra Leone. Take enough legal medication for your trip as it may not be available in Sierra Leone.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as Monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Sierra Leone.  
  
Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.  
  
Symptoms include:  
•    rash  
•    fever  
•    sore throat  
•    headache  
•    muscle aches  
•    back pain  
•    low energy  
•    swollen lymph nodes  
  
Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.  
  
Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.  
  
See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### Lassa fever

[Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever) (World Health Organization) is a risk in West Africa. It can be fatal, and there's no vaccine. It passes to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings.

To protect yourself from disease:

* avoid contact with live or dead rodents, their droppings, burrows or nests
* ensure all foods are well-cooked and covered in rodent-proof containers
* keep your body, personal belongings, utensils and common contact surfaces (including doorknobs and counters) clean
* avoid places where dust is raised, such as from sweeping and vacuuming rodent droppings

Get immediate medical help if you develop any symptoms of Lassa fever, including fever, weakness in your body or unexplained pain.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is common in Sierra Leone. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel. You'll need to show proof of Yellow Fever vaccination when you enter Sierra Leone.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)(World Health Organization) and other insect-borne diseases are common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Other common waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases, including those listed by the World Health Organization:

* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

If there is an outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you specifically request bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in freshwater

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are extremely limited in Sierra Leone, and only offer basic services. Ambulances are not reliable in Freetown, and are unavailable in most of the country. Paramedics may not have training and often have little or no equipment.  
  
You'll need to pay cash up-front before you can get treatment, even in an emergency. Carry basic medical supplies with you.  
  
If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.  
  
Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.
