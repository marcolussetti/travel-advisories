# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe and include mandatory terms.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to:

* export precious minerals without a licence from the Ministry of Mines and Resources
* take photos or videos of government buildings, airports or bridges

There are heavy penalties for diamond smuggling. Ensure that certificates of export for precious natural resources are legitimate.

Areas where photography is illegal may not be clearly marked. If you're not sure, don't take a photo. These restrictions are strictly enforced.

The law in Sierra Leone does not prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities and offers no specific protections. Expect accessibility to be limited throughout the country. Rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, and service providers, such as sign language interpreters, are not available.

Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. LGBTQIA+ relationships and identities are widely regarded as unacceptable. There are reports of discrimination and violence against LGBTQIA+ people in Sierra Leone. There is no recognition of same-sex relationships.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Sierra Leone recognises dual nationality. We recommend that you travel on your Australian passport.

If you enter Sierra Leone with a Sierra Leonean passport, local authorities will treat you as a citizen. This limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services")we can give if you're arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative, particularly for women. Avoid revealing clothing. Seek permission from locals before photographing them. Take care not to offend.

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event") is observed in Sierra Leone. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

Avoid eating, drinking and smoking in public or in front of people who are fasting.
