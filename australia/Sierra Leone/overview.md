## Overview

### Safety

* Avoid demonstrations, protests and areas where large gatherings are taking place. Public protests and demonstrations can turn violent with little or no notice and result in serious injury or casualties. Follow the instructions of local authorities and check local media for information on ongoing demonstrations.
* Crime levels are high, including in Freetown. Common crimes include armed robbery, violent assault, carjacking, burglary, pickpocketing and bag snatching. Crime increases at night. Criminals sometimes target foreigners. Don't walk in isolated areas or along dark streets. Lock your doors, even when you're inside. Avoid using public transport or taxis.
* Online friendship, romance or business scams often start in West Africa, including Sierra Leone. People who travel to meet someone they've met online are at risk of kidnapping, assault or robbery. Be wary of contact from people you don't know in Sierra Leone. Don't send money to anyone in Sierra Leone until you've confirmed their identity.
* Smugglers and criminal gangs operate in border areas. Remain vigilant in border areas and ensure you have all required documentation.

### Health

* There's currently an outbreak of Mpox in parts of Africa. Mpox can be fatal. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* Lassa fever is a risk in West African countries. It passes to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings. Avoid contact with rodents. Ensure food is well-cooked and covered.
* Yellow fever, malaria and other insect-borne diseases are common. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated before you travel and consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* The HIV/AIDS infection rate is high. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Common foodborne, waterborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases include cholera, hepatitis, bilharzia (schistosomiasis) and tuberculosis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in freshwater.
* Medical facilities are extremely limited in Sierra Leone and only offer basic services. You'll need to pay up-front. Some prescription medication may not be available, or may not be legal. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
