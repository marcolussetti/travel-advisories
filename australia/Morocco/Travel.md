#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

Australians generally don't need a visa to visit Morocco for less than 90 days. In other situations, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact your nearest [Embassy of Morocco](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/136) for the latest details.

Moroccan embassies or tourist and travel offices can inform you about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Visa overstays

Do not overstay your visa.

If you overstay your visa, you may not be able to leave Morocco until you regularise your immigration status. You could be subject to a fine, a deportation order or a ban from re-entering.

If you have overstayed your visa, or are unable to leave due to border closures, contact your nearest police station. Once you have regularised your visa status, make sure you obtain a written exit permit from the police station to present at your point of departure.

Without a written permit, you may not be able to travel out of Morocco.

#### Passport stamps

Some tourists report having trouble leaving the country without a stamp in their passport.

Get your passport stamped when you enter Morocco.

#### Closed borders

The land border between Morocco and Algeria is closed.

Don't attempt to cross into Algeria by land.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who want to use your identity to commit crimes.

To protect your passport, always keep it in a safe place.

Be aware of people trying to trick you into giving them your passport.

If your passport is lost or stolen, you should obtain a police report detailing the loss or theft of the passport, and tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/136) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Moroccan Dirham (MAD).

You must declare all amounts in foreign currency over MAD100,000 when you arrive and depart.

#### Access to money

The Australian Dollar is not on the Moroccan Government-approved exchange currencies list. You will not be able to exchange cash denominated in Australian dollars while in Morocco. Prior to arriving, you should exchange Australian dollars into US dollars or euros, which Moroccan exchange bureaus accept.

Alternatively, you could use money transfer services, such as [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/au/en/home.html) or [MoneyGram](https://www.moneygram.com/mgo/au/en/), to send yourself funds that you can collect in Moroccan Dirhams using your passport.

Only exchange currency at:

* commercial banks
* licensed exchange bureaus

Australian credit cards are generally accepted in larger cities and tourist centres.

ATMs are widely available in cities and most large towns.

Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work in Morocco.

It's illegal to take Moroccan Dirhams out of the country. Convert any unused Dirhams before you leave Morocco.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Unexploded landmines are an ongoing risk in Western Sahara. This risk is higher within 30km of the Berm, but also closer inland.

To protect yourself against landmines:

* don't travel to areas within 30km of the northern or western side of the Berm
* don't travel south or east of the Berm

If, despite our advice you travel to these areas, seek professional security advice and stick to formed roads and paths in any areas where landmines are a risk.

#### Tours

Transport and tour operators don't always meet the safety and maintenance standards you might expect. This includes [adventure activities](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"), such as diving and desert excursions.

Safety equipment, such as life jackets and seatbelts, may not be provided.

To reduce your risks while taking a tour in Morocco:

* make sure the activity is covered by your travel insurance
* check the operator's credentials and safety equipment, including communications, before you book
* ask about, and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety equipment, even if others don't
* avoid hiking alone in remote mountain areas

If you don't have access to safety equipment, use another provider (see '[Safety').](#safety)

#### Driving permit

To drive in Morocco, you must have both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

The death toll from road accidents in Morocco is high.

Hazards include:

* unsafe driving practices
* poor lighting and road quality in rural areas
* pedestrians and animals on rural roads

Driving on rural roads at night is particularly dangerous.

Drivers must carry an unfilled 'accident report' (constat à l'amiable) in the vehicle. You can buy these forms at local newsstands. It is also a legal requirement to carry a traffic cone and a reflective vest, in case of an accident or an emergency stop.

The police don't usually intervene in minor road accidents where no one is injured. All parties involved need to complete an accident report.

If the accident involves injuries, you must wait for police to arrive before moving your vehicle.

Checkpoints are common. You must be able to show:

* personal identification (ID)
* vehicle-related documents

If you plan to drive in Morocco:

* learn local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to possible hazards, especially at night
* avoid road travel at night outside urban areas

Be alert on mountain roads and major highways.

Always carry personal ID and vehicle documents, including an accident report form.

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance policy may not cover you if you have an accident while driving a motorbike, quad bike or similar. Check before you drive.

Always wear a helmet. Make sure your passenger does too.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines, preferably booked through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Several fatal bus crashes on intercity routes have occurred.

Morocco's rail network is relatively safe and reliable, but accidents happen.

In October 2018, a train derailed between the cities of Sale and Kenitra. Many passengers were killed or injured.

Pickpocketing and petty theft on trains occurs. Stay alert and don't leave luggage unattended.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Morocco's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CN) with the Aviation Safety Network.
