# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terror attacks are a risk in Morocco.

Past attacks targeted locations that are popular with tourists.

* In December 2018, terrorists murdered two foreign nationals who were hiking in a remote mountain area near Mount Toubkal.

You could get caught up in attacks directed at others.

Various terror groups target the Maghreb region for attacks. This includes Morocco.

Moroccan authorities regularly arrest suspected terrorists and people associated with terror groups.

Possible targets for future terror attacks include:

* places where foreigners go, such as hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars, and where alcohol is served or consumed
* places and institutions associated with Western interests
* schools, embassies and places of worship
* casinos, cinemas and other tourist areas
* markets and outdoor recreation events
* transport

In planning your activities, consider the kind of areas known to be terrorist targets and the level of security provided.

To reduce your risk of being affected by terrorism:

* monitor the media for any new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* always be alert to possible threats
* report any suspicious items or activities to police
* don't hike alone in remote mountain areas
* be alert if you travel to southern and border areas of Morocco
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so.

Avoid the affected area after an attack due to the risk of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, including:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching

Theft at knifepoint and other violent crime sometimes happen.

[Muggings](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") have occurred when travellers were walking on deserted beaches and poorly lit streets at night.

Aggressive begging near ATMs is frequent and robberies can occur.

Intimidation is sometimes used to force customers to buy goods. Tourists are aggressively harassed, often by men posing as official tourist guides.

Hotspots for crime include popular tourist areas, such as:

* Marrakech
* Casablanca
* Tangier
* Agadir
* Fez
* Essaouira

Women may be the subject of unwanted attention, particularly:

* when travelling on their own
* in markets, beaches and around tourist sites

To help keep yourself safe from crime:

* always keep your personal belongings close
* avoid walking in isolated areas or along dark streets at night
* take care when using ATMs
* secure your hotel room against intruders, even when you're in it
* avoid walking or travelling alone

#### Scams and fraud

Common scams and fraud include:

* charging a credit card twice
* replacing lower quality goods for those you purchased
* fake internet friendship or relationship

Australians have fallen victim to fake internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes in Morocco. These scams typically start with a relationship through an internet dating site, chat room or social media.

You may be asked to send money to help them cover travel expenses to Australia or assist in a faked medical emergency.

In most cases, the relationship will end with little chance of recovering any money.

In other cases, Australians are lured to Morocco to meet the person. When they arrive, they become victims of crimes such as kidnapping, assault and robbery.

To avoid becoming a victim of a scam:

* keep your credit card in sight during all transactions
* check goods carefully when you make purchases
* be wary if approached by people online you don't know from Morocco or other West African countries
* don't send money to anyone in Morocco until you make proper checks.

If you're the victim of a scam, get legal advice. Don't travel to Morocco to seek restitution.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media or make disparaging comments about the Royal Family of Morocco.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Domestic and regional issues can incite protests at any time. Large-scale demonstrations can occur at short notice. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

There is currently an increased risk of demonstrations and protests occurring around the country linked to the evolving situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Demonstrations have occurred in most major cities in proximity to public buildings. Additional demonstrations are expected.

Most gatherings are peaceful but isolated incidents of vandalism and looting occur.

Sporting events can attract large crowds, and tensions may lead to security incidents.

Western Sahara's status as part of Morocco is disputed. A mostly sand wall, 'the Berm', separates:

* areas controlled by Morocco
* areas controlled by an independence movement known as the Polisario Front

Armed conflict has occurred since the ceasefire collapsed in November 2020. Local or more widespread conflict could resume with little warning.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor the media for reports of possible activity
* avoid affected areas
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* take care on days of national or commemorative significance
* be extra careful on weekends, including the period around Friday prayers

Be ready to change your travel plans in case of disruptions.

If you're affected by transport disruptions, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Earthquakes

Morocco is in an earthquake zone. [Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") sometimes occur.

In September 2023, an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck Morocco, southwest of Marrakesh.

 To protect yourself in case of an earthquake:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or accommodation
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Flooding

Flash flooding can occur. Risk of flooding is higher:

* in the mountains or near rivers
* during the rainy season from November to March
