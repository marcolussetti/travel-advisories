## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a risk in Morocco. Tourist areas and public places are possible targets. Be alert to possible threats. Avoid known targets. The risk increases in remote mountain areas, the south and border areas.
* There is currently an increased risk of demonstrations and protests occurring around the country linked to the situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. There's an increased threat of attacks against Israel and Israeli interests. Follow the advice from local authorities and monitor media for any updates.
* Large public gatherings and protests can turn violent. Avoid demonstrations. Take care on weekends and around Friday prayers.
* There is occasional violent crime in Morocco. The risk increases in remote areas. Don't hike alone in mountainous or isolated areas. Get professional security advice before travelling to border areas.
* Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common. Tourists have been mugged when walking at night. Keep your belongings close. Don't walk in isolated areas or along dark streets at night.
* You may face aggressive begging and harassment, particularly near ATMs. Female travellers may be sexually harassed. Take care when using ATMs. Avoid walking or travelling alone.
* Scams and fraud are common. These include double-charging credit cards and replacing your purchased goods with lower-quality ones. Australians have fallen victim to fake internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes in Morocco.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying).

### Local laws

* Morocco has the death penalty for serious crimes, including high treason, terrorism, multiple murder and rape.
* Sexual acts between members of the same sex or outside marriage are illegal. Hotels may enforce a policy of not allowing unmarried or unrelated members of the opposite sex to share the same hotel room. Possessing pornographic material is also illegal.
* Understand and follow local laws. Morocco has strict laws around religion, the monarchy, alcohol, drug use, photography, pornography and drone use. There are also restrictions around public commentary or displays of materials that dispute Morocco's claim to sovereignty over the Western Sahara.
* Morocco recognises dual nationality, but Moroccan citizenship takes precedence. This can affect child custody disputes and military service requirements. Always travel on your Australian passport if possible.
* Moroccan society is conservative. Avoid public displays of affection. In some parts of Morocco, you should wear loose-fitting clothes that cover your arms and legs.
