# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include long prison terms.

**More information:**

* [Carrying or using drugs](/before-you-go/laws/drugs "Carrying or using drugs")

#### Death penalty

The death penalty can apply for serious offences such as:

* high treason
* [terrorism](/before-you-go/safety/terrorism "Terrorism")
* multiple murder
* [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")

#### Other laws

Sexual activities that are against the law in Morocco include:

* same-sex sexual acts
* sexual acts outside marriage

In Morocco, it's illegal to:

* preach a religion other than Islam or import religious materials that don't relate to Islam
* perform acts or make statements that criticise or denigrate the monarchy
* drink alcohol in public places
* buy pirated or counterfeit items
* present a cheque without sufficient funds

#### Marriage requirements

If you want to [get married](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") in Morocco, you'll need to present:

* a [Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage (CNI)](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/notarial-services/cni)
* a copy of your passport with a valid Moroccan entry stamp or valid residency documents

You can organise these documents through:

* the consular section of the [Australian Embassy in Morocco](https://morocco.embassy.gov.au/)
* your nearest [DFAT office](http://dfat.gov.au/Pages/contact-us.aspx) in Australia

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Morocco recognises dual nationality.

Under Moroccan law, Moroccan citizenship takes priority. This can affect your rights and responsibilities, including:

* military service
* parental custody
* access to consular services

If you're a dual national, even if your second nationality is not Moroccan, the Australian Embassy may be restricted in the [consular assistance](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide you with if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/) if possible.

Moroccan citizenship is automatic for the children of Moroccan fathers. Moroccan women who are married to foreigners can also pass on their Moroccan citizenship to their children.

Local law applies to child custody decisions. This may affect whether you can leave Morocco with your children.

If you're a dual national, seek legal advice on child custody disputes.

If you're a single parent travelling with children, you may need to carry a letter from the second parent authorising the children’s travel plans. Always carry your children’s birth certificates or have copies on hand.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in many parts of Morocco.

Public displays of affection can cause offence.

In some parts of Morocco, women should consider wearing loose clothing covering the arms and legs.

Take care in or around:

* mosques
* rural and traditional areas
* religious shrines
* religious schools

Couples may need to provide proof of marriage to get shared accommodation.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Religious festivals

Ramadan is a holy month of fasting for Muslims around the world. Respect [local laws and customs](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) during this period. 

Check the start and end dates of Ramadan prior to your travel, as these change every year. Under Moroccan law, Muslims aren’t allowed to eat, drink or smoke in public during Ramadan unless they meet requirements for a dispensation (such as illness, travel or pregnancy). 

While this doesn't apply to non-Muslims, if you are non-Muslim you should still avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public or around those who are fasting, so as not to cause offence, and not attract attention or questioning by police.

Most restaurants, cafés, eateries, and delivery services do not operate during the day, and some tourist attractions might be closed.
