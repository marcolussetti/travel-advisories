## Overview

### Safety

* Civil disorder, rioting and looting can escalate rapidly. Always pay close attention to your personal security and your surroundings. Australian officials always follow heightened security measures, including while travelling through PNG. Avoid high-risk areas and activities and consider using private security.
* [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) can happen with criminal motives. There have been incidents of kidnapping in remote areas and near some mining sites. Targets have included foreigners.
* The risk of violent crime and sexual assault in PNG is high. Criminals often use 'bush knives' (machetes) and guns (including homemade ones). Always be alert to your surroundings. Avoid going out after dark.
* Civil disorder and criminal activity have occurred at tourist resorts. Keep doors and windows locked, including when travelling by vehicle. Consider using private security.
* Civil unrest and violent inter-group and tribal conflict are common and can occur without warning. The conflicts can be extremely violent and involve guns, bush knives and other weapons, with recent events targeting women and children. Avoid protests, demonstrations, political rallies and areas where tribal fighting is happening. Criminal groups operate in remote areas of Papua New Guinea, particularly in the Highlands, including across provincial borders and in areas around logging, mining, oil and gas sites. Check security conditions and tensions by monitoring the media and local security reports before travelling to new areas.
* PNG can experience severe weather, heavy rains, flooding, landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis. Monitor the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) for updates. Infrastructure can be damaged, and roads can't be passed. Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Medical facilities are poor. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to Australia. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.
* Insect-borne diseases include malaria, Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Use insect repellent. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. If you're pregnant, ask your doctor about the risk of Zika virus before you travel.
* Poliovirus outbreaks have occurred. Make sure you're vaccinated against polio. Tuberculosis is common. Children under five years and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk. If you think you have tuberculosis, get urgent medical treatment.
* HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections are widespread. Take precautions to reduce your risk of infection.
* Dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis and waterborne parasites are also common. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Avoid bathing in freshwater sources.

Avoid travel by motorcycle, taxis and public transport. Travelling by boat can be dangerous. Marine search and rescue services are limited in PNG. Consider alternative options.
