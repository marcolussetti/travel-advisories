# Safety

#### Crime

Crime levels are high and police response can be slow.

#### Violent crime

Crime is common in PNG, but particularly in Port Moresby, Lae and other urban centres. This includes:

* murder
* robbery
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and gang rape
* bag snatching
* carjacking

Squatter settlements in towns and cities are dangerous.

'Bush knives' (machetes) and guns are often used in assaults and [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

The crime rate increases leading into the Christmas holiday period.

Most crime is opportunistic but foreigners have been targeted at home, at work or while travelling.

Robbery is a higher risk while:

* driving (carjacking)
* walking on the street (particularly after dark)
* at shopping centres or markets
* visiting hotels or restaurants
* visiting areas frequented by foreigners
* at major urban areas, including Port Moresby and Lae

Most robberies involve guns and/or knives and machetes.

Criminal groups operate in remote areas of Papua New Guinea, particularly in the Highlands, including across provincial borders and in areas around logging, mining, oil and gas sites. There have been incidents of [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") in remote areas and near some mining sites where foreigners have been targeted.

Women are at greater risk of sexual assault and theft.

Disciplinary forces are poorly resourced and corruption is prevalent, many organisations, including the Australian High Commission, use private security.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Road-based crimes

Carjacking is common in Port Moresby, Lae, and along the highway between Lae and Nadzab Airport, especially at night.

Criminals may use roadblocks outside of towns to stop and loot vehicles and attack you.

To stay safe on the roads:

* keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* consider using a security escort or travel in convoy if you travel at night
* avoid travel by taxi or public transport, especially if you're a woman

See [Travel](#travel)

#### Tourist resorts

Civil disorder and criminal activity, including armed robbery, has happened at tourist resorts in coastal areas and at other locations across PNG.

#### Trekking safely

Consider using a security escort.

There have been armed robberies and attempted carjackings of foreign day trekkers near Sogeri, Varirata National Park and on the Kokoda Track, mostly recently in 2023.

Ensure walking companies are experienced.

Find out more about trekking the Kokoda Track under [Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/pacific/papua-new-guinea#travel).

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Tension between tribal, communal or clan groups can occur without warning. There's an increased risk during election periods. There have been instances of unlawfulness during elections and in response to arrest and detention sometimes resulting in deaths. Violent tribal clashes often occur in Enga Province, Mendi and Nipa in the Southern Highlands Province, however conflicts can occur in any province. In July 2024, at least 26 people, mostly women and children, were killed as a result of a territorial dispute in Angoram District in East Sepik Province. Similar incidents have occurred in Hela Province since 2018, including in 2022. 

Civil unrest occurs regularly, including in Port Moresby, and can escalate quickly. Avoid non-essential travel when civil unrest is occurring. Disputes between police and the Government often lead to civil unrest and can rapidly deteriorate into violence, rioting and looting. Activity is generally opportunistic or focussed toward government infrastructure. Significant civil disorder, violence and looting occurred in Port Moresby and other parts of PNG in January 2024.

Civil unrest events often disable local transport networks, medical and social services, and force the closure of retail businesses.

Fighting often involves guns, bus knives and makeshift weapons. Rioting and looting can follow.

Outbreaks of violence have happened in squatter settlements, marketplaces and urban centres, and during elections including:

* Port Moresby
* Lae
* Wabag
* Madang
* Mt Hagen (Western Highlands)
* Mendi
* Porgera
* Goroka
* Tari
* Daru
* Angoram (East Sepik)

If a clash happens, it may cause:

* destruction of property
* serious injury or death
* disruption to services, including ground and air transport
* an increase in opportunistic crime

There's ongoing violence because of illegal mining at the Porgera gold mine. People have been killed and injured.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent quickly.

To protect yourself from violence and unrest:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* avoid non-essential travel to areas where civil unrest is occurring
* avoid demonstrations and protests
* monitor the media, including local social media, and local security reports
* consult airlines, accommodation or other local service providers
* check on security conditions and tensions before travelling to a new area
* avoid known trouble spots
* follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

There have been incidents of kidnapping in remote areas and near mining sites. A number of foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped in Hela and Southern Highlands Province since 2022. Isolated cases will continue to occur and can involve foreigners, especially in isolated rural locations. An Australian was kidnapped in Hela Province in February 2024.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Personal security

Many organisations, including the Australian High Commission, use private security:

* to get a quick response to calls for help
* as security escorts

Australian officials always follow heightened security measures, including while travelling through PNG.

Officials receive security training and follow strict guidelines, which may include limiting or avoiding travel in certain areas during periods of increased risk.

To safeguard your personal security:

* always be alert to your surroundings
* avoid high-risk areas and activities
* take appropriate security precautions in public and private spaces
* consider using private security
* keep accommodation and vehicle doors and windows locked

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Bougainville

In Bougainville, you're more at risk in Central Bougainville and Southern Bougainville because of:

* remote terrain
* former combatants with weapons
* sensitivities around mining, especially the old Panguna mine in Central Bougainville

Medical services in Bougainville are basic. Make sure your insurance covers medical evacuations.

To reduce your risks while you're in Bougainville:

* avoid political gatherings
* monitor local media
* check with local sources about the security situation before travelling
* be alert to your surroundings
* turn back if you're concerned for your safety
* take personal security precautions

#### Climate and natural disasters

A large-scale landslide occurred on 24 May 2024 in the Porgera-Paiela district of Enga province. The landslide destroyed several villages and damaged local infrastructure, resulting in many casualties. The road network remains badly damaged and is unusable in parts. Small landslips continue to occur. Reconsider your need to travel to Enga. If you're in Enga, stay away from the affected areas, monitor the media, and follow the advice of local authorities.
