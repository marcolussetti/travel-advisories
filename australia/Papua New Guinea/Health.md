#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Papua New Guinea. Take enough legal medication for your trip, including for potential travel delays, as availability and supply issues are common.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases occur throughout PNG, including in Port Moresby.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) and dengue are common throughout the year.

Cases of [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/chikungunya/en/) and [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation)have been reported.

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) is a low-risk for short-term visitors in urban areas.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to Zika virus-affected areas

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medication to prevent malaria and getting vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Poliovirus

Vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks occur from time to time in PNG. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus in environmental samples in parts of PNG in May 2025, following an earlier outbreak in 2018.

Make sure you're vaccinated against [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis).

#### Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis) is common.

Multi-drug-resistant strains are present, including in Port Moresby and Western Province.

People at greater risk include:

* children aged under 5 years
* those with medical conditions that affect their immune system

If you think you have tuberculosis, get urgent medical treatment.

#### HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases

The [HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) infection rate is high. Other sexually transmitted infections are widespread.

Take precautions if you're doing anything that exposes you to risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [dysentery (shigellosis)](https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/index.html)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

Local water services can be polluted or turned off. Waterborne parasites occur in many rivers. Outbreaks of [whooping cough](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/whooping-cough) have been reported in some provinces, including Oro Province.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid bathing in fresh water sources

Seek medical attention if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Emergency health responses

The government may declare a national emergency if there's a health outbreak of diseases such as:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [dysentery](https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/dysentery)
* [seasonal influenza](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/flu)

In an emergency, the government may make provisions, laws, orders or regulations to stop the spread of diseases. This can happen without notice.

During an emergency health response there could be:

* travel restrictions
* restaurant closures
* closed water sources

#### Animal bites and stings

Venomous snakes are common. Reports of snake bites increase during the wet season.

Jellyfish and other marine animal stings can be fatal.

Seek advice from local authorities, your tour operator or hotel about:

* seasonal conditions
* recommended precautions
* other potential dangers

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Health care facilities are poor, including in Port Moresby.

A small number of private hospitals and clinics are present in Port Moresby and Lae. Access is very expensive and payment or insurance is required prior to receiving treatment.

Large towns usually have enough facilities for routine problems and some emergencies.

Health facilities in rural areas, including along the Kokoda Track, are basic.

Ambulance services outside Port Moresby are limited.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to Australia. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

If you're diving, the only hyperbaric (decompression) chamber is in Port Moresby.

If you plan to dive in PNG:

* dive well within safety limits
* check your travel insurance covers it
* make sure you're covered for medical evacuation
