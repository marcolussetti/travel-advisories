# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Other laws

You may get a fine or jail sentence if you:

* possess or sell pornography or sex items
* commit adultery

#### War materials

It's illegal to remove surplus war material from PNG. This includes:

* guns
* bullets
* aircraft or vehicle parts
* other items used during WWII

**More information:**

* [PNG Customs](http://customs.gov.pg/)

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Sexual acts between people of the same sex are illegal. Prison sentences apply.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

PNG only recognises dual nationality for a limited number of countries, including Australia.

If approved by the PNG Government, PNG nationals can apply for dual citizenship with Australia – see [Immigration and Citizenship Authority (ICA) PNG](https://ica.gov.pg/citizenship/citizenship-and-dual-citizenship).

If you're a dual citizen travelling on a non-Australian passport, this limits the [consular services](/node/117) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

The traditional custom of 'payback' occurs.

You could face 'payback' if you:

* offend local customs
* engage in illegal or inappropriate sexual or financial relations
* damage someone's property (including livestock)

'Payback' can include violence or demands for money.

Dress and behaviour standards are conservative. Take care not to offend.

Ask permission before taking photos of:

* people
* cultural sites
* spirit houses
