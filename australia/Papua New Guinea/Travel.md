#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You need a visa to enter PNG and must apply for a visa before travel. Australian citizens cannot obtain a visa on arrival. You can apply for certain visas online, such as eVisas. eVisas are available through the [PNG eVisa portal](https://ica.gov.pg/visa/visit).

There have been reports of fraudulent websites targeting foreign nationals applying for eVisas to PNG. If applying for an eVisa, use the official PNG Immigration and Citizenship Authority website. It's illegal to work in PNG on a tourist visa.

If you breach PNG immigration laws, you can be:

* fined
* jailed
* deported
* banned from re-entry

#### Border measures

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact your airline or your nearest [embassy or consulate of Papua New Guinea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/157) for details about the latest visa and entry requirements.

You can't bring fruit or vegetables into PNG due to quarantine restrictions.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the PNG Kina (PGK).

Declare all amounts over PGK20,000 when you arrive or leave.

Most hotels accept international credit cards.

ATMs are in Port Moresby and major urban centres but aren't always working. Only use ATMs in hotels and other secure locations due to the high risk of crime.

Ask your bank if your Australian cards will work in PNG.

#### Local travel

#### Local restrictions

Travel restrictions, including restriction of movement or checkpoints, may occur at short notice. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Kokoda Track trekking

Walking the Kokoda Track is physically demanding. You must have a high level of fitness.

Weather conditions can be unpredictable.

Health risks include:

* dysentery
* dehydration
* poor local services
* delayed medical evacuation

Every year several Australians are medically evacuated. It's expensive. You or your travel insurance provider must cover the costs. Some people have died.

Adequate travel insurance is essential.

Serious crime and civil disorder occur throughout PNG, including:

* along the Black Cat Track in Morobe Province
* along the Kokoda Track
* at the ends of the Kokoda Track in Central and Oro Provinces

Consider using a security escort.

Unexploded weapons and remnants of war are found in PNG. Especially along the Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and Rabaul.

The condition and stability of these weapons is unknown. They can maim or kill you.

If you find a war remnant, don't disturb it.

#### Permits for the Kokoda Track

The local authorities regulate trekking along the Kokoda Track and permits are required.

Your trekking operator will need a permit issued by the Kokoda Track Authority before you trek. Make sure they have the permit before you start trekking.

Track blockades can occur at short notice by local communities anywhere along the track.  Track blockades have occurred in May 2023 and September 2024 and can last several weeks. Trekkers should contact their trekking company for the latest information. 

If you plan to trek the Kokoda Track:

* prepare with extensive training
* get medical advice and fitness testing before you commit to trekking
* make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activities and medical evacuation
* use guides from reputable trekking companies
* give your itinerary and trekking company contact details of family or friends in Australia

While on the Kokoda Track:

* stay hydrated
* protect yourself from dysentery
* store your passport in a waterproof bag or container
* pay close attention to your personal security
* stay with your group
* don't touch or disturb anything that could be an unexploded war weapon, whether near the track or on display
* follow local rules and customs, and let your trekking company handle conversations and negotiations with local communities

#### Other trekking

* You should ensure trekking companies have made arrangements with landowners to ensure safe passage.
* You should ensure trekking companies have a safety plan if something goes wrong.

#### Telecommunications

Mobile phone service in Port Moresby is generally good. In areas outside of Port Moresby the satellite and mobile phone global roaming services can be patchy.

Landline phones can have outages.

To stay in communication:

* check mobile coverage with your service provider
* make contingency plans for service outages
* consider carrying a satellite phone

#### Driving permit

You can drive in PNG for up to 6 months using a valid Australian driver's licence.

After 6 months, you'll need a local licence.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in PNG than in Australia.

Roads are poor, especially in rural areas.

Other hazards include:

* unpredictable and drunk drivers
* poorly maintained vehicles
* overcrowded vehicles

Large crowds can form quickly after road accidents. These crowds can become violent without warning.

Carjacking occurs across PNG, including in Port Moresby.

Flash floods and landslides can cause roads to close during the wet season. This can result in travel delays. The timing of the wet season varies across the country.

Parts of the Highlands Highway between Lae and Mount Hagen are particularly affected.

Police use roadblocks to check licences and vehicle registrations in Port Moresby.

If you plan to drive in PNG:

* monitor local media about fuel shortages
* know local traffic laws and practices before driving
* keep your car windows and doors locked
* avoid driving at night
* if you travel at night, consider using a security escort or travel in a convoy (see [Safety](#safety))
* consider using a security escort along the Highlands Highway (including between Lae and Nadzab Airport)
* make sure your licence, vehicle registration and safety stickers are up-to-date to minimise problems at roadblocks

#### Motorcycles

Avoid travel by motorcycle.

Poor roads and high crime risks mean riding a motorbike in PNG is more dangerous than in Australia.

It's safer to travel in a locked vehicle.

Make sure your travel insurance covers riding a motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Avoid taxis, especially if you're a woman.

Taxis are poorly maintained and often targeted by criminals.

Use vehicles hired from a reputable company, hotel or secure transport provider.

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport.

Also avoid privately owned minibuses, known as public motor vehicles (PMVs). They are poorly maintained and often targeted by criminals.

Use vehicles hired from a reputable company, hotel or secure transport provider.

#### Sea travel

Travel by ferry or small local boats can be dangerous. Modern boats may be overcrowded and lack basic safety equipment (especially for small children), these include:

* life jackets
* life rafts
* fire extinguishers

Several ferries have sunk in rough weather. Many people have died.

Boat services can be disrupted at short notice. Overcrowding of ferries and boats is common.

Consider flying to your destination instead.

There are limited marine search and rescue services in PNG.

To reduce your risk when travelling on the water:

* check with your tour operator/crew to determine safety standards and safety equipment provided is appropriate
* carry your own life jacket, an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) and a satellite telephone
* avoid single-engine boats and travelling at night unless the vessel is appropriately equipped
* travel in convoy with all boats at half capacity or less
* tell your family or friends in Australia when you expect to leave and arrive
* use another provider if appropriate safety equipment isn't available

Register EPIRBs and PLBs with the [Australian Maritime Safety Authority](https://beacons.amsa.gov.au/). In case of maritime accident, notify the PNG National Maritime Safety Authority on its 24-hour emergency number: +675 7351 7017.

International passengers arriving by sea require a visa. Seek further advice from your cruise company or [PNG Customs](https://www.customs.gov.pg/border.php?q=arriving-at-sea-ports-in-png%22%20\l%20%22:~:text=Passengers%20who%20travel%20to%20Papua,Immigration%20can%20grant%20these%20visas.). You may be detained or fined if you arrive illegally.

#### Air travel

Flying in PNG can be dangerous because of:

* difficult terrain
* extreme weather
* poor conditions of some remote airfields

Since 2000, there have been more than 20 aircraft accidents.

Flight delays and cancellations are frequent. Ongoing shortages of aviation fuel can disrupt domestic air travel with little or no notice. Check your flight schedule with your airline.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [PNG's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=P2) with the Aviation Safety Network.
