#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You must get a visa to enter Burundi. This can be done before travel via any Burundian diplomatic mission. Visitors can also obtain business or tourist visas on arrival at Bujumbura airport and any land or maritime entry points. You can get a 30-day visa upon arrival at the Bujumbura Airport with a payment of USD90 for multiple entries and USD70 for a single entry.

Visas can be renewed if you're already in Burundi.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an embassy or consulate of Burundi for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Burundi doesn't have diplomatic representation in Australia. The nearest embassy of Burundi is in Tokyo.

#### Registration

All passengers entering or leaving Burundi via Bujumbura Airport must [register online](https://migration.gov.bi/Form_Entry_Exit_Code) using the [incoming/outgoing passenger form](https://migration.gov.bi/Form_Entry_Exit_Code)before travelling.

#### Border measures

Border closures can occur without notice. The land border with Rwanda has been closed since 11 January 2024.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Burundi. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Burundian Franc (BIF). You'll need approval to take more than BIF2000 out of the country.

Some businesses may accept US dollars or euros.

ATMs are limited and unreliable.

Most hotels and businesses don't accept credit cards.

Bank transfers in and out of the country may not be available.

Plan ahead. Have enough cash to meet your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Landmines have exploded in areas popular with travellers.

#### Road travel

Traffic accidents are common.

[Road safety and driving](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety") hazards include:

* poor condition of most roads and vehicles
* speeding
* bad driving habits
* poor lighting

Heavy rains can cause flooding and landslides. These may damage roads and infrastructure.

Recurrent fuel shortages and long queues to access fuel are common across the country.

Roadblocks occur in all areas, including Bujumbura. Some are formal checkpoints maintained by police, but not all are official.

Armed thieves are a significant risk across Burundi. See [Safety](#safety).

If you plan to travel by road:

* check local security and road conditions
* get security advice from an expert
* arrange personal security measures
* travel in daylight hours
* travel in a convoy — the US Embassy recommends at least 2 vehicles
* carry copies of your passport and visa, though you may be asked to produce the originals at checkpoints

Have a contingency plan in case you can't travel by road.

#### Border areas

Border closures can occur without notice. The Burundi land border with Rwanda is currently closed.

There have been armed incursions from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) into neighbouring border areas of Burundi, including Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces.

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport, especially after dark. The US embassy doesn't allow their staff to use public transportation.

There's a high risk of crime, and local roads and vehicles are in a poor state. See [Safety](#safety).

#### Air travel

The international airport can close without warning.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
