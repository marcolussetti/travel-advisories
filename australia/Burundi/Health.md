#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Burundi. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Kenya.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.
