#### Civil unrest and political tension

There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi that can cause sporadic violence. Outbreaks of violence have been reported during elections.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Violent attacks are common. You should avoid all large gatherings and remain vigilant. Follow the advice of local authorities.

Clashes between police and the public are common in Bujumbura and other parts of Burundi.

If you travel to Burundi:

* get expert security advice
* use the right personal security measures for the situation
* avoid protests and other public gatherings and remain vigilant
* monitor the media for possible unrest
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Border areas

We advise do not to travel to Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, Kibira National Park and areas of Bujumbura Rural province west of the Rusizi river. The security situation can change at any time in these regions, and there's an ongoing risk of cross-border attacks by armed militias from the Kivu provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Don't cross the border into the DRC. We advise do not travel to the DRC. If, despite our advice, you travel to the DRC, review the travel advice for the [DRC](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/democratic-republic-congo).

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a significant threat. An attack could occur at any time, including places frequented by expatriates and foreigners.

The Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab has made threats in the past targeting Burundi for its role in the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.

Possible targets of terror attacks include:

* clubs, hotels, resorts, restaurants, bars and tourist areas
* schools and places of worship
* markets and shopping centres
* political, sporting and outdoor recreation events
* bus terminals, public transport and airports
* government buildings

If despite the risks, you travel to Burundi:

* arrange personal security measures
* consider places known to be terrorist targets and the level of security provided
* always be alert to possible threats
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack nearby, leave the area as soon as it's safe.

Avoid the affected area due to the risk of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is widespread. It often involves weapons.

Common types of violent crime include:

* ambush by armed criminals on the [roads](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety"), particularly those leading out of Bujumbura
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* burglary
* [carjacking in traffic](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

The risk of assault is higher when walking alone on roads around Lake Tanganyika.

The risk of crime increases after dark. Avoid walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre. The US Embassy tells their staff not to travel during hours of darkness outside Bujumbura Mairie (typically 6pm to 6am).

If despite the risks, you travel to Burundi:

* keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* be alert to the threat of carjacking
* secure your accommodation against intruders
* be alert to your surroundings
* don't travel after dark
* adopt personal security measures

#### Kidnapping

Foreigners can be a target of [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping").

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Burundi can experience [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [flash flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [mudslides](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [earthquakes](/node/345)

To protect yourself if a natural disaster occurs if, despite our advice, you travel to Burundi:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor media and other sources for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family
