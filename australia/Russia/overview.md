Latest update

We've reviewed our travel advice for Russia and continue to advise do not travel. Foreigners, including Australians, are at risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Russian authorities make strong, negative comments regarding Western countries, including Australia. Local authorities may adopt a more negative attitude towards foreigners in Russia and arbitrarily enforce local laws. Avoid any protests or demonstrations and avoid commenting publicly on political developments.  
  
There's a high threat of terrorism. Terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and Daesh-aligned groups, continue to call for attacks in Russia. Attacks can be indiscriminate and may occur on or around seasonal, festive, or religious events in public places, including popular tourist sites. Attacks could occur with little or no warning. Always be alert to possible threats. Military activity is underway in the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. Russian authorities introduced a federal state of emergency in these regions. The security situation could deteriorate with little warning.  
  
If you're in Russia, leave immediately using the commercial options available or private means if it's safe to do so. Departure routes from Russia may become disrupted at short notice. Have an alternate exit plan. Review your personal security plans and carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

## Overview

### Safety

* Foreigners, including Australians, are at risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Russian authorities make strong, negative comments about Western countries, including Australia. Local authorities may adopt a more negative attitude towards foreigners in Russia in reaction to perceived support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. Non-participating bystanders can draw scrutiny from security forces and have been detained.  Remain vigilant, avoid protests or demonstrations, avoid commenting publicly on political developments, and review visible information on sensitive issues on your public social media profiles.
* There's a high ongoing threat of terrorism. Terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and Daesh-aligned groups, continue to call for attacks in Russia. Attacks can be indiscriminate and may occur on or around seasonal, festive, or religious events in public places, including popular tourist sites. Attacks may occur with little or no warning. Always be alert to possible threats and have a clear exit plan. In 2024, there was a terrorist attack at Crocus City Concert Hall, resulting in significant loss of life. Also, in 2024, over 20 people were killed following an armed attack on synagogues, churches and police in Dagestan. Security measures or restrictions may continue to be in place across the country. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Military activity is currently underway in the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. In August 2024, Russian authorities introduced a federal state of emergency in these regions and a "counter-terrorism operation", including the region of Bryansk. Security measures or restrictions may be introduced with little to no notice. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Security incidents, such as drone attacks and explosions, often occur in southern and western areas of Russia, including regions bordering Ukraine, Moscow, St Petersburg and Kazan. This can cause significant flight delays and travel disruption. You shouldn't attempt to travel to the Russia-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Russia.
* The security situation could deteriorate further with little warning. If you're in Russia, leave immediately using the commercial options available or private means if it's safe to do so. Departure routes from Russia may become disrupted at short notice, so have an alternate exit plan.
* If you decide to stay in Russia, review your personal security plans. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Russia is limited. The Australian Government won't be able to evacuate you from Russia.
* There are limited transportation options, restrictions on financial transactions and possible shortages of essential products and services.
* In 2022, the Russian Government introduced a 'medium response level' in several regions of Russia, including Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov and a 'heightened preparedness level' in the remainder of the Central and Southern Federal districts. A basic readiness level covers the rest of Russia. There may be an increase in security personnel and installations. Security measures or restrictions may be introduced with little to no notice. Monitor the media for developments.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely"). Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.
* Continue to follow our advice on Smartraveller. If you have significant concerns for your welfare or that of another Australian, contact the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia.

### Health

* The laws regarding the import and use of medicines are strict. For each medication containing restricted substances, you need a doctor's letter and a notarised translation confirming your need. Contact the [Embassy of Russia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/166) for details.
* Rabies and tick-borne encephalitis are on the rise. Ticks are common from April to October. Take care when travelling through forests.
* Infectious diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, diphtheria, measles, and tuberculosis are at risk. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water.
* Public medical facilities in Russian cities are below Australian standards and basic in rural areas.

### Local laws

* Foreigners, including Australians, are at ongoing risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Russian authorities may arbitrarily enforce local laws. You may be interrogated without cause by Russian officials and may become a victim of harassment, mistreatment and extortion.
* Russia may subject males it regards as Russian to mobilisation, regardless of any other citizenship held. Laws introducing heavy penalties for 'crimes against military service' have been passed. The Australian Government won't be able to intervene if you're mobilised.
* Conscription occurs regularly in Russia. The government may subject males it regards as Russian to mandatory conscription, regardless of any other citizenship held. The maximum age of conscription is 30 years old. Draft notices can be serviced to the conscripts online, preventing conscripts from leaving the country once the notice is registered and sent.
* Russia severely restricts free speech. Publishing and distribution of information (including private comments on chats, social media or social apps) related to the Russian leadership, government, government policies, armed forces and any military operations may be considered illegal. Foreign journalists and other media workers in Russia may face high risks, including arrest and imprisonment. Don't share or publish information about current events in Ukraine and Russia.
* Don't use or carry any illegal drugs. Penalties are severe.
* Carry your passport, visa, and migration card at all times. Authorities won't accept copies.
* Don't take photos of military places or sensitive areas, such as passport control. Using commercial film, television, camera equipment, or drones in public is also illegal without permission.
* Russia doesn't recognise dual nationals. This severely limits the consular services we can give if you're arrested or detained. To leave, you'll need a valid Russian passport.
* Same-sex relationships are technically legal but are not widely accepted. Violence against members of the LGBTQIA+ community occurs. Russia bans "LGBT propaganda", criminalising any act regarded as an attempt to promote what Russia calls "non-traditional sexual relations". The promotion of LGBTQIA+ issues may be considered illegal by local authorities, and activists may face consequences under Russian law. Gender changes without medical requirements are banned. The law also annuls marriages in which one person "changed gender" and prevents transgender couples from adopting children.
* Law enforcement agencies in Russia cooperate closely with agencies in a number of countries, including but not limited to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

### Travel

* If you're in Russia, leave immediately using the commercial options available or private means if it's safe. The security situation could deteriorate further with little warning. If you decide to stay in Russia, review your personal security plans. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. Have an alternate exit plan.
* Confirm with your transport operator that services are still operating if you plan to depart Russia. Commercial travel routes between Russia and Europe are often disrupted due to measures taken in response to military action in Ukraine. Several Russian airports are now closed to the public, disrupting internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities. [Finland](/destinations/europe/finland "Finland") has closed its land and maritime borders with Russia indefinitely.
* Confirm the entry requirements before arrival if you're travelling through an overland border crossing into [Estonia](/destinations/europe/estonia "Estonia")or [Latvia](/destinations/europe/latvia "Latvia"). Latvia introduced an entry ban on vehicles registered in Russia in September 2023. There's a ban on vehicles crossing into/from Estonia at the Ivangorod-Narva crossing. Train services are also suspended. Entry and exit on foot is allowed. Additional restrictions or entry requirements could be imposed or changed suddenly. Some borders may close without notice. Australia and other countries have placed sanctions on Russia. Russia's response to these sanctions may disrupt travel and affect travellers.
* If, despite our advice, you decide to enter Russia, expect thorough security checks at the border, including questioning and inspections of electronic devices. Entry requirements can change at short notice. Contact your airline or the nearest embassy or consulate of Russia to confirm entry requirements.
* Since December 2024, foreign travellers have been required to submit their biometric data upon arrival in Russia at Moscow International airports and the land border checkpoint in the Orenburg region.
* Australians have been sanctioned by Russia. See the full [Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/russia#travel) advice for Russia's sanctions against Australians. Australians should obtain legal advice if they have concerns about the potential impacts of Russia’s sanctions.
* Russian airlines and railways may be affected by parts and essential technical components shortages for their fleets, which could affect maintenance and safety standards. Research your railway and aviation provider before choosing their services. The International Civil Aviation Organisation has issued a Significant Safety Concern (or 'red flag') notice regarding Russian airlines' capacity to oversee safety.
* Bank cards issued outside of Russia (including from Australia) don't work in Russia. You can't access funds from these cards once you enter. You also can't transfer money from your Australian bank account to a Russian bank account.
* Dual nationals can't leave Russia without a valid Russian passport. If your passport expires while you're in Russia or if you enter Russia using a repatriation certificate, you'll need to get a new one before you leave. This can take up to 3 months. The Australian Government is unable to intervene or fast-track this process.
