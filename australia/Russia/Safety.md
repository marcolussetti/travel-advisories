#### Terrorism

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Russia. Terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and Daesh-aligned groups, continue to call for attacks in Russia. Attacks can be indiscriminate and may occur on or around seasonal, festive, or religious events in public places, including popular tourist sites. Attacks could occur with little or no warning. Always be alert to possible threats and have a clear exit plan. Russia has seen several terrorist attacks, which have caused large casualty numbers. Russia's aviation has also been targeted. 

In March 2024, there was a terrorist attack at Crocus City Concert Hall near Moscow, resulting in 145 deaths and more than 500 people injured. 

Russian authorities continue to announce arrests and the disruption of planned attacks.

Security measures or restrictions may continue to be in place across the country. Follow the advice from local authorities.

Terrorists have attacked other European cities. Targets have included:

* places of worship
* government buildings
* schools
* shopping areas
* tourist sites
* restaurants
* bars
* nightclubs
* entertainment venues
* transportation hubs
* airlines
* major events which attract large crowds

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* be extra cautious around possible terrorist targets
* always have a clear exit plan
* report anything suspicious to the police
* monitor the media for any new threats
* take official warnings seriously and follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### North Caucasus

There's a high threat of terrorism in parts of the North Caucasus, including:

* Chechnya
* Dagestan
* Ingushetia
* North Ossetia
* the south-eastern part of Stavropol bordering Chechnya
* Karbardino-Balkaria
* Karachay-Cherkessia

In June 2024, over 20 people were killed following an armed attack on synagogues, churches and police in Derbent and Makhachkala cities in Dagestan.

Terrorist attacks continue to occur in Chechnya. Several people have been killed and injured.

Our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in those parts of the North Caucasus is limited.

If, despite our advice, you travel to these parts of the North Caucasus:

* monitor local conditions via media and travel operators
* arrange personal security measures

#### Georgia-Russia border

The Georgia-Russia border area is volatile because of tensions in Georgia.

If, despite our advice, you travel in the border region, read our [Georgia travel advice](/destinations/europe/georgia "Georgia").

#### Security situation

Military activity is underway in the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. In August, Russian authorities introduced a federal state of emergency in these regions in addition to the "counter-terrorism operation", which includes the region of Bryansk.

Security measures or restrictions may be introduced with little to no notice. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.

Security incidents, such as drone attacks and explosions, often occur in southern and western areas of Russia, including regions bordering Ukraine, Moscow, St Petersburg and Kazan. These can cause significant flight delays and flight cancellations. You shouldn't attempt to travel to the Russia-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Russia.

The security situation could deteriorate further with little warning. If you're in Russia, leave immediately using the limited commercial options available or private means if it's safe to do so. Departure routes from Russia may become disrupted at short notice. If you decide to stay in Russia, review your personal security plans. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

In 2022, the Russian Government introduced a 'medium response level' in several regions of Russia, including Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov and a 'heightened preparedness level' in the remainder of the Central and Southern Federal districts. A basic readiness level has been introduced in the rest of Russia. There may be an increase in security personnel and installations. Security measures or restrictions may be introduced with little to no notice. Monitor the media for developments.

#### Ukraine border areas and Crimea

The Russia-Ukraine border is volatile due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Security incidents regularly occur in Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, and other regions of Russia bordering Ukraine, including explosions and large fires. The security situation in the region could deteriorate at short notice. You shouldn't travel to the Russia-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Russia.

We currently advise do not travel to Ukraine due to the volatile security environment and military conflict. Read the [Ukraine travel advice](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert)for more information.

The Australian Government doesn't recognise Russia's claimed annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea or its other territorial claims in occupied Ukraine.

#### Leaving Russia

Where it's safe to do so, you should leave Russia immediately. Use your judgment to decide the best time and safest means of exit. 

Transport routes may be disrupted. Plan for delays at land border crossings. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Make sure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication, and fuel. Make sure you have payment options that will work during your journey and at your destination. 

Read your destination's travel advice to ensure you meet the entry requirements. These may differ when entering by road, rail, or air. Be aware that some borders may close without notice. Commercial travel routes between Russia and Europe have been impacted by measures taken in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Check with your airline or travel agent for current flight availability. Any travel options you pursue are at your own risk. See '[Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/russia#travel)'.

* [Lithuania](/destinations/europe/lithuania "Lithuania")
* [Mongolia](/destinations/asia/mongolia "Mongolia")
* [Poland](/destinations/europe/poland "Poland")

If you decide to stay in Russia:

* follow the instructions of authorities
* ensure your travel documents are up-to-date, and keep your passport and other travel documentation safe
* contact your family and friends in Australia so they're aware of your location and situation
* keep up to date with developments on the security situation, monitor reputable media, and regularly check our travel advice and [social media](/about-us/social-media "Social media")
* review your personal security plans and make contingency plans to leave as soon as you judge it safe to do so
* always be alert and aware of your surroundings
* avoid large gatherings and areas with groups of fighters and military equipment.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Foreigners, including Australians, are at ongoing risk of arbitrary detention or arrest.

Russian authorities may adopt a more negative attitude towards foreigners in Russia due to perceived support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. Russian authorities may arbitrarily enforce local laws. You may be interrogated without cause by Russian officials and may become a victim of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.

Russia's parliament has passed laws that severely restrict free speech. Foreign journalists and other media workers in Russia may face considerable risks, including arrest and imprisonment.

While the effects of this law are still unclear, you may be detained or fined for:

* sharing or publishing information that local authorities deem false
* sharing or publishing information that may be detrimental to the armed forces
* calling for, sharing, or publishing speech in support of sanctions against Russia

You should not:

* share or publish information related to the current events in Ukraine and Russia (review the information visible on your public social media profiles on sensitive issues).
* participate in demonstrations and large gatherings

Avoid commenting publicly on political developments.

Anti-war and anti-mobilisation protests have taken place in cities across Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Many protesters have been arrested.

Unsanctioned protests are illegal, and you can be arrested if you participate. Remain vigilant and avoid rallies, protests, demonstrations, and other large public gatherings, as they can turn violent, and you may be arrested.

#### Crime

#### Theft and assault

Petty crimes, pickpocketing and muggings are common. Groups of children sometimes commit crimes, too.

Hot spots for crime include:  

* Red Square
* the Izmailovsky Market
* other tourist attractions
* the Moscow and St Petersburg metros

Thieves often steal passports. They target travellers in [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), particularly in large cities.

To protect yourself from theft and assault:

* keep your personal belongings close, particularly in tourist areas
* be aware of your security in public places, particularly at night
* monitor local media on crime
* racially or religiously motivated assaults may occur throughout Russia.

#### Using taxis

People have reported extortion and robbery while taking unauthorised taxis.

To protect yourself from robbery while travelling in taxis:

* only use official taxi apps or companies
* don't flag down taxis on the street
* don't share taxis with strangers
* always negotiate and confirm the fare before you get in a taxi

#### Credit card and ATM fraud

Credit card and ATM fraud is common.

To protect yourself from fraud:

* only exchange currency at banks
* keep your credit card in sight during transactions
* only use ATMs inside banks and during business hours
* always hide your PIN

#### Other scams

Criminals may try to cheat you by changing money in the street or a bank queue.

Some Australians have been victims of fraud by bogus internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes operating from Russia.

These are large-scale, well-organised [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers").

Criminals arrange to meet people through internet dating schemes or chat rooms. After getting to know you, the criminal will ask you to send money so they can travel to Australia. However, the relationship ends after the money has been received, and the funds can't be recovered.

Be wary of people you meet through internet dating schemes or chat rooms.

#### Extortion

People have also reported harassment, mistreatment and extortion by police and other local officials.

If you suspect you're being extorted by a police officer or other local official, offer to walk with them to the nearest police station. Once there, you can check their identity and their demands.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate

Criminals may drug and rob travellers at nightclubs and bars. This sometimes happens after accepting offers of food, drink, or transportation from strangers.

To protect yourself from spiking-related crime:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* don't leave drinks unattended
* leave your drink if you're not sure it's safe
* stick with people you trust in bars, nightclubs, and taxis
* don't accept offers of transport from strangers

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") is common in parts of the Northern Caucasus.

It can be for:

* political purposes
* ransom
* retribution

Foreigners have been targeted in the past.

If, despite the risks, you travel to an area where there is a particular threat of kidnapping:

* get professional security advice
* arrange personal security measures

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

**More information:**

* [Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather "Severe weather") during winter can disrupt travel in Russia.

To protect yourself from accidents caused by severe weather:

* take care when walking in snowy, icy or windy conditions
* take care when driving
* use appropriate driving equipment, such as winter tyres or chains
* monitor the media and other sources for updates

If you're delayed, contact local authorities about a visa extension if required.

#### Flooding

Spring flooding caused by melting ice is common in some parts of Russia. This can result in large-scale evacuations and the unavailability of essential services for extended periods.

If you are in Russia, monitor the media and follow the advice from local authorities.

#### Snow and ice

Wind, snow, and ice-related accidents injure and kill people annually. These include:

* falls
* traffic accidents
* avalanches
* collapsed roofs and snow falling from roofs
* falling debris
* prolonged exposure to extreme cold

Slipping on ice can result in serious injuries, such as broken bones, back injuries, or paralysis.

#### Fires

During summer, forest and peat [fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") can occur in Russia, including in the Moscow region.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

The North Caucasus and the far eastern region of Russia can experience [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis").

[Tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") are common in all oceanic regions of the world.

To protect yourself from natural disasters, take official warnings seriously.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occurs, follow the advice of local authorities.
