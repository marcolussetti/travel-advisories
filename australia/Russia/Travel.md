# Travel

#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Australia and other countries have placed sanctions on Russia. Russia's response to these sanctions may disrupt travel.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Russia unless you're travelling on certain commercial cruise ships.

You can't get a visa on arrival.

If you arrive in Russia without a valid visa, authorities will fine, detain and deport you at your own expense. They may bar you from re-entering.

Make sure you apply for the correct visa type, such as a 'tourist' or 'visitor' visa.

If your visa type doesn't match the purpose of your visit, authorities may:

* not let you enter
* detain you

You may need to provide biometric fingerprints for the visa application process.

After you get your Russian visa, check your passport details are correct, including the following:

* full name
* passport number
* date of birth
* visa type
* intention of stay
* validity dates

If there are errors, return your passport to the [Russian Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/166) for correction.

It's impossible to amend visa details once you're in Russia.

#### Border measures

If, despite our advice, you decide to enter Russia, expect thorough security checks at the border, including questioning and inspections of electronic devices.

You're required to submit your biometric personal data on arrival in Russia.

Biometric data will be collected at Moscow international airports (Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, Vnukovo and Zhukovsky) as well as the Mashtakovo land border checkpoint in Orenburg region. Children under 6, diplomats, employees of international organisations accredited in Russia, and their family members will be exempt from this requirement.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/166) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Australians sanctioned by Russia

The Russian Foreign Ministry issued statements on its website advising that, in response to Australian sanctions, the Russian Government had added several Australians to a 'stop list', denying them entry into Russia on an indefinite basis.  

These statements can be viewed here (copy and paste the URL into a new browser if you can't open the link):

DFAT can't provide advice on the implications of another country's sanctions. If you're listed, you should obtain legal advice if you have concerns about the potential impacts of the Russian sanctions. Do not travel to Russia if you're on Russia's 'stop list'.

#### Other formalities

#### Migration card

Foreign visitors receive a migration card on arrival in Russia.

If you receive a paper migration card, keep the stamped exit portion of the card with your passport.

The migration card covers both Russia and Belarus. When leaving either country, you must show the stamped card to passport control.

If you lose your migration card:

* your departure could be delayed
* you could be stopped from staying at a hotel in Russia

You can get a replacement from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but this process is complex and could delay your departure.

#### Travel with Children

If you're [travelling with a child](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children"), you may need to show evidence of parental, custodial or permission rights. This is particularly the case for dual nationals. See 'Local laws'.

#### Electronics

The government strictly controls the import of electrical and some high-technology equipment.

The rules are complex.

You may import terminal global positioning systems (GPS) devices if you declare them on arrival. However, you'll need a special permit to import a GPS device connected to a computer or an antenna.

Authorities can detain you if you don't have a permit.

To import a satellite phone, you must show proof of advanced approval. Request approval from the [Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications](http://eng.rkn.gov.ru/).

Russian border officials can demand to inspect any electronic device, including installed software, when you enter or leave the country.

#### Travel between Russia and Belarus

Do not travel to Russia or [Belarus](/destinations/europe/belarus "Belarus") due to the security environment and impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If you're in Russia or Belarus, leave immediately using the limited commercial options available or private means if it's safe to do so.

If despite our advice, you decide to travel between Russia and Belarus, foreign travellers holding a Russian or Belarusian visa, and an ID document recognised in both countries may enter, leave, stay or transit through both countries via the assigned international checkpoints for the period of the visa validity.

Visa-free entry into Belarus doesn't apply to travellers arriving from or travelling to Russia.

Contact the [Embassy of Russia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/166) and the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus](http://mfa.gov.by/en)for details.

#### Registering your stay in Russia

If you stay more than 7 working days, including your arrival and departure day, you must register with the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

You must pay a registration fee.

Most hotels do this for their guests, but you're legally responsible. Confirm with check-in staff on arrival that they've registered you.

The registration process can be complex if you're not staying at a hotel.

Register at the nearest post office if you're travelling on a visitor visa.

Register through your employer if you're travelling on a visa that lets you work. Confirm with your employer that they've registered you.

If you don't register, authorities can fine you or delay your departure.

#### Visa overstays

Make sure you leave Russia before your visa expires. Some visas, including tourist visas, can't be extended.

If you overstay your visa, you won't be allowed to leave Russia until the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs determines your legal status or deports you.

Authorities can detain you until they've processed your case. Penalties for overstaying include fines and deportation. You may be banned from re-entering.

On 1 January, Russia introduced a temporary 4-month grace period (until 30 April 2025), where foreign nationals who violated the terms of stay in Russia can regulate their legal status and obtain necessary permits from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs authorities. Foreign nationals who have not regulated their legal status in Russia before 30 April 2025 will be included in the registry of ‘controlled persons’, deported from Russia and banned from re-entering.

#### Customs Rules

Russian Customs provides a list of goods that must be declared when entering or leaving Russia, regardless of whether they come in carry-on or unaccompanied/checked-in luggage. 

You must declare cash amounts exceeding the equivalent of 10,000 USD as well as certain types of goods, including jewellery and antiques. 

Items imported by air for personal use that are worth more than 10,000 EUR or weighing more than 50 kg must be declared.

For cash amounts exceeding the equivalent of 100,000 USD, documents confirming the origin of the money, in addition to customs declaration, must be provided.

If you fail to declare items exceeding the value or weight standards, these may be confiscated, and you may be detained and charged with an administrative or criminal offence. 

If you fail to declare amounts of cash exceeding the threshold, your money may be confiscated, and you may be detained and charged with an administrative or criminal offence. 

Make sure a customs official stamps your declaration. Only stamped declarations are valid.

Russia has imposed restrictions on exporting certain categories of goods, including foreign-made medical products. Seek advice from local authorities.

Russia has strict regulations on the export of antiques, artworks and items of historical significance. These are items purchased in Russia or imported to Russia from overseas. They also include modern art and posters if they are particularly rare or valuable.

Authorities may not allow the export of items more than 100 years old.

If you want to export any antiques, artworks or items of historical significance:

* keep receipts of your purchases
* obtain an export permit from the Ministry of Culture in advance of travel — export permits aren't issued at the airport
* declare each item to border authorities when you leave Russia
* be ready to show each item to border authorities
* be ready to show receipts for each item to border authorities

Don't try to export items requiring permits without the relevant paperwork. This is a serious offence.

Russian Customs legislation about the import and export of money and goods may change without warning. Seek advice from local authorities.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If your passport is lost or stolen you'll need to obtain an emergency passport and an exit visa to leave Russia within the 72-hour visa-free period. If it's not done within 72 hours, you'll face a court hearing and possible fine, deportation and entry ban.

To arrange a new visa:

* obtain an official police report
* apply for a replacement passport through the [Australian Embassy in Moscow](https://russia.embassy.gov.au/)
* apply to Russian authorities for an exit visa
* include the police report with your application

If you replace your passport while in Russia, make sure authorities transfer your visa to the new passport.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Russia is the Rouble (RUB).

Russia has imposed temporary restrictions on the export of foreign currency in cash out of Russia. When exiting, you can't take more than the equivalent of 10,000 USD in cash.

You must carry proof that your funds were imported and declared or legally obtained in Russia. Make sure a customs official stamps your declaration. Only stamped declarations are valid.

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mastercard, Visa, and American Express have suspended operations in Russia. Cards issued outside Russia won't work at Russian merchants or ATMs. Cards issued inside Russia may continue to work, but they won't work outside Russia. You won't be able to access your funds through Russian banks or make payments to Russian businesses with non-Russian credit/debit cards. 

Be prepared with alternate means of payment should your cards be declined. Ensure you have enough money to cover your stay.

You may not be able to exchange Australian dollars or old, worn, or damaged US dollar and euro banknotes for Russian Roubles. Ensure you have enough money to cover your stay in Russia. 

Traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted, even in Moscow and St Petersburg.

#### Travel to Latvia or Estonia

Latvia bans the entry of vehicles registered in Russia. More information can be found on the [State Revenue Service website](https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/article/persons-vehicles-registered-russian-federation-are-banned-entering-latvia). Vehicles are also banned from crossing into/from Estonia at the Ivangorod-Narva crossing. Train services are suspended. Entry and exit on foot are allowed. Additional restrictions or entry requirements could be imposed or changed suddenly. Be aware that some borders may close without notice. 

If you're travelling through an overland border crossing into [Estonia](/destinations/europe/estonia "Estonia")or [Latvia](/destinations/europe/latvia "Latvia"), confirm the entry requirements for your destination before arrival.

Australia and other countries have placed sanctions on Russia. Russia's response to these sanctions may disrupt travel and affect travellers. Confirm entry requirements for your [destination](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) before arrival, as additional restrictions or entry requirements could be imposed or changed suddenly.

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to Russia, note that some areas across the country are considered 'closed' to foreigners. Foreigners need government permission to enter these 'closed' areas. If you need government permission or are unsure if you need it, contact the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

#### Driving permit

You should carry an International Driving Permit (IDP).

You may drive with an Australian driver's license if you carry it with a notarised Russian translation.

#### Road travel

Driving in Russia can be hazardous due to:

* poor driving standards
* ice and snow in winter
* poor road conditions in rural areas

The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0%.

#### Taxis

Some taxis appear official but aren't licensed by local authorities.

People have reported extortion and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") while taking unauthorised taxis. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/russia#safety)

Book an official taxi through the local taxi app, by phone, at major hotels and from inside airports.

#### Air travel

Flights from Russia to other countries are limited. These may change or be suspended at short notice. You should contact airlines or travel agents directly for the most current information.

The [EU announced](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2389) that 21 Russian-owned airlines were banned from flying in EU airspace due to safety concerns.

Russian airlines and railways may be affected by shortages of parts and essential technical components for their fleets, affecting maintenance and safety standards. If you're flying domestically or internationally, research your aviation provider before choosing their services.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
