#### Travel insurance

Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Russia. Do not travel to Russia. See '[Safety](#safety)'

You may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care if you're not insured.

#### Physical and mental health

Do not travel to Russia. If, despite our advice, you travel to Russia, consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor. 

Russia has temporarily restricted exporting certain categories of goods, including foreign-made medical products. 

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Russia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Russia has strict laws about the import and use of medications, including medications that are available over the counter in Australia, such as cold and flu tablets.

When you arrive in Russia, you must present a doctor's letter to authorities confirming your need for each medication. Especially if your medications contain the following:

* barbiturate
* codeine
* sibutramine
* anabolic steroids
* androgens and other sex hormones
* analgesic, such as tramadol
* psychostimulants
* other restricted substances

The letter must:

* contain a description of the medication, including the chemical composition
* describe the required dosage
* explain the underlying medical condition
* confirm the medicine is for personal use only
* be signed by your treating doctor

You must also have a notarised translation of the letter into Russian.

Before you leave Australia, contact the Embassy of Russia for the latest rules for bringing medicines into Russia.

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne diseases

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) (World Health Organization) and other tick-borne diseases are a risk, especially if you travel through forested areas.

Ticks are common in rural areas from spring to autumn: April to October.

People have reported increased incidents of tick-borne encephalitis.

#### Measles

Measles cases can routinely occur in Russia, with the country currently experiencing increased measles activity. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk.

Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Rabies

There have been reports of [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) across Russia.

Rabies is deadly. Humans can get rabies from mammals, such as:

* dogs
* monkeys
* bats
* other animals

If you're bitten or scratched by a dog, monkey, or other animal, get treatment as soon as possible.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:  

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [diphtheria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diphtheria)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles?language=en)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid unpasteurised dairy products

Get urgent medical attention if you have a fever or diarrhoea or suspect food poisoning.

#### Medical facilities

Public medical facilities in Russian cities are below Australian standards.

Standards are extremely basic in rural areas.

There are a few international-standard private facilities in major cities – these clinics can be very expensive to access.

Before you're treated, private facilities need either:

* up-front payment
* evidence of adequate insurance
* a written guarantee of payment

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to get proper care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
