# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Foreigners, including Australians, are at ongoing risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Russian security services have arrested Western citizens on spurious charges, singled out Western citizens in Russia for detention and/or harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and have convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence. The US Government warns that Russian officials may unreasonably delay consular assistance to detained US citizens.

Russia has introduced criminal liability for publishing and distributing (including via social media and chat apps) anything they consider 'deliberately misleading' about the Russian government, armed forces and any military operations. These laws have been interpreted and applied broadly to many forms of dissent.

Gender changes are banned, including gender transition surgery, hormone therapy and changing gender on official documents without medical requirements. The law also annuls marriages in which one person "changed gender" and prevents transgender couples from adopting children.

There are laws banning "LGBT propaganda". These criminalise any act regarded as an attempt to promote what Russia calls "non-traditional sexual relations". Sharing information or public display of any material promoting "non-traditional relationships" is now a serious criminal offence. The 'international LGBT movement' has been classified as an 'extremist organisation' under Russian law, criminalising the display of symbols such as the rainbow flag (including on social media).

In November 2022, Russia announced that the partial mobilisation of military reservists for the conflict in Ukraine was complete. However, a decree formalising the completion hasn't been issued. The Russian Government may subject males it regards as Russian to mobilisation, regardless of any other citizenship held. Laws introducing heavy penalties for 'crimes against military service' have been passed. The Australian government will not be able to intervene if you're mobilised.

Law enforcement agencies in Russia cooperate closely with agencies in several countries, including but not limited to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in one of these countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.

Russian authorities impose restrictions on real estate and foreign currency transactions for foreign residents. These restrictions can be revised at short notice. Seek advice from local authorities.

#### Drugs

Possessing, selling, consuming, or carrying any illegal drugs is illegal.

Penalties are severe and include long prison terms.

Russia has strict rules around medication carried into the country for personal use, including some medications that you can get over the counter in Australia.

If you don't declare restricted medications, authorities could detain you. See 'Health'.

#### Other laws

Foreigners are required to present in person with their ID and confirmed registration on the government services portal (Gususlugi) or the Unified Biometric System to the mobile network operators to purchase a Russian SIM card.

Foreigners will be limited to 10 subscriber numbers per person and will be required to register their International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) against the SIM card with the operator.

Foreigners can only use their SIM card with registered mobile equipment. If they change their phone or equipment, they must notify the operator.

Routine police checks are common in public places.

Carry your passport, visa, and migration card with you at all times. Authorities won't accept copies.

If you can't provide travel documentation on request, authorities can detain and fine you.

In Russia, it's illegal to:

* take photos of military places, strategic sites, and other sensitive areas, such as passport control and guarded railway sites
* use commercial film, television, or camera equipment in public areas without permission, but hand-held home video cameras are allowed
* use drones without permission from the Russian aviation authority.

Penalties for breaching the law include fines, jail, and deportation.

Russia regulates religious activity. Authorities restrict activities such as preaching and distributing religious materials.

If you plan to engage in religious activity, ensure you're not breaking local laws.

Contact the Embassy or Consulate of Russia for more information.

#### Cyber security laws

Russia has blocked or restricted several social media platforms, messaging apps and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter), Signal and YouTube.

Russia has banned certain Virtual Private Networks (VPN).

#### Official documents

Some Australian documents, such as birth or marriage certificates, need to be [legalised](/consular-services/notarial-services/documents "Documents we can legalise") before Russian authorities will accept them.

If you have an Australian document that you need to use while in Russia, contact the Embassy or Consulate of Russia for information.

[Apostilles](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") and some legal certificates can be issued by:

* [DFAT](http://dfat.gov.au/pages/default.aspx) in Australia
* [Australian embassies and high commissions](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx) overseas

#### Surrogacy laws

Russia bans surrogacy for all foreigners except those married to Russian citizens. Recent court cases have resulted in long custodial sentences for some providers of surrogacy services. All children born through surrogacy in Russia are granted Russian citizenship, regardless of their parent's citizenship.

Get independent legal advice before making surrogacy arrangements in Russia or with residents of Russia.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Russia doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this severely limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained. Foreigners, including Australians, are at ongoing risk of arbitrary detention or arrest.

In November 2022, Russia announced that the partial mobilisation of military reservists for the conflict in Ukraine was complete. However, a decree formalising the completion hasn't been issued. Russia may subject males it regards as Russian to mobilisation, regardless of any other citizenship held. Laws introducing heavy penalties for 'crimes against military service' have been passed. The Australian Government won't be able to intervene if you are subjected to mobilisation.

Conscription occurs regularly, and Russia may subject males it regards as Russian to mandatory conscription, regardless of any other citizenship held. Conscription in Russia occurs semi-annually, and conscripts typically serve one year. The maximum conscription age is 30 years old. The draft notice is to be serviced to the conscripts online and prevents conscripts from leaving the country once the notice is registered and sent.

Russian authorities won't recognise your Australian nationality if you're a dual national. They will treat you like any other national of Russia.

If you're a dual national:

* you must enter and leave Russia on a Russian passport
* you can enter Russia using a repatriation certificate (svidetelstvo na vozvrashcheniye) if you don't have a Russian passport, but you must still leave Russia on a Russian passport
* you must declare any other nationalities or foreign residency permits to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs
* you could be conscripted into the Russian military if you're a male between the ages of 18 and 30

Contact the [Embassy or Consulate of Russia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/166) well before any planned travel to Russia.

Dual nationals can't leave Russia without a valid Russian passport.

You'll need to get a new Russian passport before you leave if:

* your Russian passport expires while you're in Russia
* you enter Russia using a repatriation certificate

Getting a new Russian passport for non-residents is complex and can take up to 3 months. The Australian Government is unable to intervene or fast-track this process.

Children born outside Russia and added to their parents' Russian passports need their own passport to leave Russia.

If you're travelling alone with a child, Russian border authorities may require the following:

* documentary evidence of your relationship to the child
* written permission for the child to travel from the non-travelling parent
