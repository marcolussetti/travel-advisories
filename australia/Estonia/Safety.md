#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is generally not a problem in Estonia.

However, you should monitor local media for updates during public protests and events that draw large groups of people. If you're in an area affected by protests, follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Crime

Street crime includes:

* bag snatching
* pickpocketing
* [mugging](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* petty theft

Airports, train stations, parks, routes to major hotels and the Old Town in Tallinn are popular locations for pickpockets.

Pickpockets often work together in small groups. Keep a close eye on your belongings.

Drink spiking happens in bars and casinos. Don't leave drinks unattended.

Credit card fraud happens in tourist areas. Locations include shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs.

Internet crimes have been reported. These include online dating and [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") involving money.

Be wary of online contact from people you don't know.

Don't send money until you've checked who you're sending it to.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Estonia can experience [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") across the country, including:

* extremely cold winters
* heavy snowfalls

These affect major metropolitan areas.

Winter weather can severely delay transport and temporarily shut down services and roads.

Flooding may happen in spring, from March to May.

Be particularly careful when walking outside in winter. Roads and footpaths can be very slippery and icy, and broken bones are common. Consider carrying and wearing ice grips for shoes where necessary, even in urban areas. These are available in many shops.

In winter, don't venture onto frozen bodies of water (lakes, rivers, the sea) without following (or seeking advice from) local authorities. Serious accidents can occur.

If there's a natural disaster or severe weather:

* monitor the media and local sources for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities
