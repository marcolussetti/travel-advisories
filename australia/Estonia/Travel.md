#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Estonia is part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter Estonia without a visa in some cases.

In other situations, you'll need to get a visa.

When you first enter the Schengen Area, get an entry stamp from border control staff on your passport.

Always carry your passport, even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/65) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Border crossings between Estonia and [Russia](/destinations/europe/russia "Russia") can close at short notice. Check with [Estonianborder](https://www.estonianborder.eu/yphis/index.action) before crossing. There can be lengthy delays, and private cars bearing Russian number plates are banned from entering Estonia.

You'll need to comply with all Estonian border rules and requirements. Check the [Estonia Police and Border Guard Board](https://www.politsei.ee/en/procedure-for-crossing-the-estonian-russian-border) for more information. Be particularly careful in border areas with [Russia](/destinations/europe/russia "Russia") when travelling in Eastern Estonia. Always be fully aware of where you are, and don't, under any circumstances, approach the border zone. There are some locations where public roads cross Russian territory. Australians with dual Russian or Belarussian citizenship may also face lengthy delays or be denied entry.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports.

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements .

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Estonia's currency is the euro.

You must declare currency of 10,000 euro or more, or the equivalent if you're travelling between Estonia and any non-European Union country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare your currency, authorities will fine you.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### Pedestrians

By law, pedestrians must wear reflectors at night. If you don't, you can be fined.

You can buy cheap reflectors at most supermarkets and small shops.

#### Driving permit

You must have a valid Australian driver's licence to drive in Estonia (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted).

You may also need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to hire a vehicle. Ask the car rental company when you book.

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.
