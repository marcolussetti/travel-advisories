# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include heavy fines and jail, even for possessing small amounts.

#### Other laws

Same-sex relationships are legal and same-sex marriages are recognised by Estonian law. Attitudes towards same-sex relationships can be conservative.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Estonia recognises dual nationality in some situations.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Dual-national males may have to do military service if they have a permanent address in Estonia. If you're unsure of your obligation, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Estonia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/65).
