#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

From 1 May 2025, you must complete a [Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)](https://tdac.immigration.go.th) within three days before arriving in Thailand. The TDAC must be submitted online through the [Thailand Immigration Bureau website](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/). See the [Thailand Immigration Bureau website](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/manual/en/) for further information, including a guide to completing the TDAC and how to submit the TDAC online.

You can get a visa exemption for up to 60 days on arrival in Thailand for tourism and short-term business travel. Your passport must be valid for more than 6 months before entering Thailand.

If you require an E-Visa, you can apply through the [Official Thai E-Visa website](https://www.thaievisa.go.th/). You can only apply if you're currently not in Thailand and in a country where E-visa services are available, and you're no longer required to submit your passports and supporting documents in person at the Royal Thai Embassy/Consulate-General. After the E-Visa application has been approved, a confirmation email will be sent, which can be printed and presented to airlines and Thai immigration officials when entering Thailand.

You must get an entry stamp from an immigration officer at the point of entry into Thailand. Don't get your visa, visa extension or entry stamp from visa shops or travel agents in Thailand.

A passport that has been altered or that contains counterfeit visas and entry/exit stamps is deemed invalid. You may be arrested, prosecuted and/or deported.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest Embassy or consulate of Thailand, the [Royal Thai Embassy Canberra](https://canberra.thaiembassy.org/) or [Royal Thai Consulate-General Sydney](https://sydney.thaiembassy.org/en/index). See [the official website of the Tourism Authority of Thailand](https://www.tourismthailand.org/home) for the latest details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Visa overstays

If you overstay your visa, you'll need to pay a fine before you can leave. You can also be:

* arrested
* prosecuted
* jailed
* deported
* banned from re-entering Thailand.

Thai authorities can blacklist you, which means you can never return to Thailand.

Penalties for not paying the fine include long prison sentences. Conditions at Immigration Detention Centres are harsh.

#### Border measures

You may be subject to biometric screening at points of entry. Clarify entry requirements with your airline, [International Air Transport Association (IATA)](https://www.iata.org/) or your nearest Thai Embassy.

Travellers from Yellow Fever-endemic countries and those with Mpox outbreaks must pre-register through the [Thai Health Pass digital platform](https://thaihealthpass.com/) before checking in with the airline at the country of origin.

#### Travel within Thailand

Foreign passengers must present their passport for domestic flights within Thailand. You may be refused boarding if you are unable to present your passport. 

#### Departure from Thailand

Travellers should refer to the relevant airline or travel provider for information about departing Thailand.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

Don't give your passport to third parties - like a jet ski or motorcycle rental businesses - as a guarantee. Companies may hold on to the passport and ask for payment for damages.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Thailand is the Thai Baht (THB).

You can convert Australian dollars for THB in tourist areas, major cities and towns.

Only exchange money at authorised money changers.

Most hotels, restaurants and higher-end shops accept international credit cards.

ATMs are available in cities and regional centres.

[Card skimming](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") occurs. See [Safety](#safety)

#### Local travel

#### Driver's permit

To drive a car or motorcycle in Thailand, you'll need a valid international driving permit (IDP) and your Australian driver's licence for the type of vehicle you're using. Australian digital driver's licences may not be accepted. If you drive without the correct licence, you could be [arrested or jailed](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/arrested-jailed). 

To drive a motorbike, you'll need a valid motorcycle licence. Some rental companies will tell you otherwise.

Don't drive any vehicles not covered by your Australian licence. In the event of an accident, you may not be covered under insurance.

The [Department of Land Transport](https://www.dlt.go.th/en/) issues Thai driver’s licences. Contact them to confirm:

* your eligibility
* what documents you need to apply

The legal driving age in Thailand is 18.

#### Road travel

Thailand has one of the highest traffic-related fatality rates in the world. Motorcyclists are most at risk.

Road accidents are common, including in resort areas such as Phuket, Pattaya and Koh Samui.

Driving in Thailand is dangerous due to:

* speeding
* reckless passing
* ignoring traffic laws

Be extra careful during holidays, such as Songkran (Thai New Year). Alcohol use and congestion are worse during these times.

Don't drink and drive.

If you're walking, use overhead walkways. Look in both directions before crossing streets, even at marked crossways.

#### Motorcycles

Under Thai law, motorcycle riders and passengers must wear a helmet. However, hire companies or motorcycle taxis rarely provide helmets. You may need to shop around to hire a helmet.

Australians are regularly injured or die in motorbike accidents in Thailand. Alcohol is often involved.

If you're in an accident, police may detain or arrest you until compensation is agreed. This can often cost thousands of dollars.

Many vehicle hire companies don't have insurance.

If you have a motorcycle accident, you could be responsible for any damages, loss or costs associated with injury to others. The embassy can't help you negotiate on compensation demands.

Visit the [Australian Embassy Thailand](https://thailand.embassy.gov.au/bkok/Other_Services_for_Australians.html) or [Australian Consulate-General Phuket](https://phuket.consulate.gov.au/pket/servicesforaustralians.html) websites for a list of lawyers in Thailand.

If you plan to hire a motorbike, make sure:

* your insurance policy covers you
* you have a valid motorcycle licence
* the hiring company has comprehensive and third-party insurance
* you know the excess you would need to pay if you have an accident
* you always wear a helmet

Don't drink and drive, or drink and ride.

Never give your passport as a deposit or guarantee.

#### Taxis, tuktuks and motorcycle taxis

Official, metered taxis are generally safe and convenient. Ensure the driver’s identification card is visible. Be alert to possible [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and safety risks.

Be aware of apparently friendly taxi or tuktuk drivers who offer you cheap tours. They will take you to shops where they receive a commission. You may be overcharged or sold worthless goods or gems.

Before you get in an unmetered taxi, tuktuk or motorcycle taxi, agree on the fare and the route.

If using rideshare apps such as Grab, make sure you enter the vehicle with the same plate number and name shown in the app.

Make sure your bags are secure when you're travelling in a tuktuk or motorcycle taxi.

Never put yourself in danger by confronting a taxi, tuktuk or motorcycle taxi driver. Call the Tourist Police on 1155 if you need help.

Be careful when opening taxi doors. Look out for other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.

#### Sea travel

Ferry and speedboat travel can be dangerous. Serious incidents involving tourists have occurred and people have died.

If you plan on [travelling by boat](/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel "Travelling by boat")or ferry:

* check safety standards are in place
* check there is enough safety equipment for everyone
* wear your life jacket at all times
* avoid travelling after dark
* don't get on overcrowded boats

#### Air safety

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Thailand's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=HS) with the Aviation Safety Network.
