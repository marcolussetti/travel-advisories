# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Thailand can be unpredictable. Large protests have occurred in Bangkok and other areas. In previous years, large political protests and government crowd control operations have resulted in violence.

More incidents are possible.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, processions and public gatherings
* follow media and other sources
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities
* if you see a suspicious package or bag, stay clear and report it to Police

#### Thailand-Cambodia border

Thailand and Cambodia have an ongoing border dispute. There is ongoing violence and armed conflict between military forces along the Thai-Cambodian border. There's a risk of landmines and unexploded weapons near the border area.

Be extra careful at tourist areas, including:

* the Preah Vihear temple (known as Khao Pra Viharn in Thailand)
* the Ta Kwai temple (known as Ta Krabei in Cambodia)
* the Ta Muen Thom temple (known as Ta Moan in Cambodia)
* Don Tawal temple
* Chong Bok temple
* Chong An Ma temple
* Chong Chom temple.

Border crossing points along the Thai-Cambodia border continue to be closed at short notice. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Thailand-Myanmar border

Fighting and armed theft can occur along the Thai-Myanmar border. This includes:

* fighting between the Myanmar military forces and armed groups
* clashes between Thai security forces and armed criminal groups, such as drug traffickers

Armed clashes between the Myanmar military forces and armed groups inside Myanmar may lead to border closures.

If you try to cross the border illegally, you may be detained and deported.

Bandits may target you if you travel through national parks in this border region.

If you travel to this region:

* monitor local media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities
* watch out for other signs of unrest
* pay close attention to your personal security
* take official warnings seriously

#### Thailand-Malaysia border

Reconsider your need to travel to or from the three most southern provinces:

* Yala
* Pattani
* Narathiwat

Violence includes attacks and bombings, with deaths and injuries. Since 2004, over 7500 people have been killed and many more injured in these provinces.

Secondary bombings are often coordinated to target people who respond to the first explosion.

Over the past few years, multiple coordinated explosions have occurred in the southern border provinces, and low-level insurgent activity continues.

If you travel to or stay in these provinces, you could get caught up in violence directed at others.

Attacks can happen at any time.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Attacks, including bombings and shootings, are possible anytime. They can happen anywhere, including Bangkok and Phuket.

Popular tourist areas may be the target of terrorist attacks.

Thai authorities have warned of possible attacks on symbolic dates or holidays.

Possible targets for future attacks include:

* embassies
* shopping malls, markets and banks
* hotels and beach locations
* restaurants, bars and nightclubs
* schools and places of worship
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals or other gatherings in public spaces

Other targets include public buildings, public transport, airports and sea ports.

To reduce your risk of being involved in a terrorist attack:

* have a clear exit plan in case there's a security incident
* be alert to possible threats
* report suspicious activity or items to police
* monitor the media for threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack:

* leave the area as soon as it's safe
* follow the advice of local authorities
* don't gather in a group after an attack
* don't gather in a group if you're evacuated from a building
* avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Gun-related violence can occur at any time.  
  
In October 2023, 3 people were killed and 4 injured in a shooting at the Siam Paragon Mall in Bangkok.  
  
In October 2022, 36 people were killed in a shooting and stabbing incident in Nong Bua Lamphu province.

Since 2004, over 7500 people have been killed and many more injured in the southern border provinces of Thailand (Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat).

#### Crime

#### Sexual assault and violent crime

Travellers may experience [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), other [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Be extra careful in tourist spots such as Khao San Road and Sukhumvit in Bangkok, as well as the night-time entertainment areas in Bangkok, Pattaya and Phuket.

Don't leave food or drinks unattended. They may be contaminated with drugs or other toxic substances. You're at higher risk of sexual assault and theft if you get drugged.

Stay with people you trust at parties, in bars, nightclubs and taxis. Be cautious if you're leaving a venue with someone you've just met. Even if it's just as friends. You're more vulnerable when separated from people you know.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

If you're a victim of violent crime, including rape, get immediate medical attention.

Under Thai law, courts will only accept the results of a medical examination from some government hospitals. After you've been examined by a government hospital, you can receive medical attention at a private hospital. Please contact the Australian Embassy Bangkok, Consulate-General Phuket, or Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra for assistance.

#### Petty crime

Money and passports have been stolen from budget hotel and hostel rooms, and from bags on public transport. Thieves also target luggage stored on trains and below buses.

Bags have been snatched by thieves on motorcycles or sliced open with razor blades.

To reduce your risk of theft:

* don't leave valuables in luggage stowed under buses or away from you on trains
* be wary of motorcycles approaching from behind as you walk on the footpath
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you
* consider carrying your bank cards and cash separately to avoid losing all your funds if you lose your bag

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events, or the Thai monarchy on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Be aware of drink-spiking. Don't drink home-made or local cocktails. They can contain narcotics or poison. You're at higher risk of sexual assault and theft if you get drugged.

Never leave your drink unattended.

Stay with people you trust at parties, in bars, nightclubs and taxis.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with have been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes for:

* marine tourism activities, such as scuba diving and snorkelling
* water sports, such as parasailing and jet-skiing
* adventure activities, such as bungee jumping, zip lining and rock climbing
* animal attractions, including elephant safaris

Thailand has introduced stricter regulations regarding scuba diving and snorkelling activities. You cannot touch or move marine life, including coral, stir up sediment or feed fish. You must also wear a life vest when snorkelling. You may be reported to local authorities for not following regulations.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* only use reputable businesses who comply with the safety regulations of the country you’re visiting
* ask the operator about their qualifications and safety policies, including first aid training and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Thailand experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* storms
* [floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")

Severe weather events are likely to disrupt transport, electricity and communications.

To stay safe during severe weather:

* check media and weather reports
* check in with your tour operator
* take official warnings seriously
* don't enter areas affected by flooding or landslides

If there is a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place

* follow the advice of local authorities
* Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Storms and floods

Severe storms and widespread seasonal flooding can occur without warning. This includes flash floods.

The wet season in north and central Thailand is from May to October.

In Koh Samui and the south-east of the peninsula, the wet season is from November to March.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes occur in Thailand.

Tsunamis are more likely in Thailand because of the risk of earthquakes.

Check with the [Indian Ocean Tsunami Information Centre](https://iotic.ioc-unesco.org/) for further information.

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away if advised, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
