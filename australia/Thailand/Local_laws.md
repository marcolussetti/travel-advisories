# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're [arrested or jailed](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/arrested-jailed "Arrested or jailed overseas"), the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty.

Possession of even small quantities of drugs for recreational purposes can lead to long jail sentences and deportation.

Thai authorities may conduct spot-checks for illegal drugs in tourist areas.

Travellers have been targeted for narcotic tests. Under Thai law, authorities have the right to demand urine samples from people suspected of taking illegal drugs.

If you're asked to submit a urine sample, ask to do it at a police station. You can also ask to contact the Tourist Police on 1155 and request English-speaking officers.

Private recreational use of cannabis is decriminalised if the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is below 0.2% in weight. Cannabis use in public places remains illegal, and smoking outside is considered a public nuisance. Offenders risk fines and arrest. It is still illegal to sell or supply any extracts of cannabis containing more than 0.2% of THC.

While cannabis is decriminalised in Thailand, be aware that in the next destination you're travelling to it may be illegal, including when transiting. This may include residual amounts of illicit drugs in your system (such as in your blood or saliva) or on items you are carrying.

Follow directions from local authorities.

#### E-cigarettes and vaporisers

E-cigarettes, e-brake, e-cigars, other vaporisers (vapes) and refills are prohibited, even for personal use.

Producing, importing, transferring or selling these items is illegal. You face either 10 years of imprisonment or a fine up to Thai Baht (THB) 1 million, or both.

Concealing, disposing, purchasing or receiving these items is also illegal. You face either 5 years of imprisonment, a fine of up to THB 500,000, or both.

#### Other laws

Penalties for breaking the law can be severe.

These penalties can also apply to anyone aged under 18 years who is subject to Thai juvenile judicial processes. Penalties can include detention in a juvenile or adult prison.

The death penalty can apply to:

* murder
* attempted murder
* rape
* drug offences
* crimes against the state, including treason
* some offences against the monarchy

Insulting the monarchy, or defacing images of the monarchy - including on a bank note bearing the King's image - can lead to prison terms of up to 15 years.

Take care not to cause offence when posting, commenting or liking items about the monarchy, including on social media.

In Thailand, it's illegal to:

* travel without carrying identification
* gamble - other than at a few major race tracks
* fly a drone without being registered
* make a false statement to police, including about an insurance claim

It is also illegal to smoke on beaches in tourist areas, including:

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Thai-Australian dual nationals may be liable to complete military conscription.

If you're a dual national, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Thailand](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/foreign-embassies/Pages/foreign-embassies-and-consulates-in-australia.aspx) before you travel.

#### Local customs

Respect local customs and take care to not offend. Deliberately ignoring local customs can cause grave offence.

Do not show the soles of your feet or touch the top of a person's head. These are insulting in Thai culture.

If in doubt, ask for local advice.
