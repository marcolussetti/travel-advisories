* There's an ongoing risk of terrorist attacks in Thailand. Popular tourist areas may be the target of terrorist attacks anywhere across Thailand, including Bangkok and Phuket. Phuket International Airport has increased security measures and passengers should arrive early for their flight. This follows the recent discovery of an explosive device near the airport. Thai authorities also defused devices in Phuket, Krabi and Phang Nga and made arrests. Coordinated attacks have occurred in the southern provinces. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to an increased threat of attacks against Israeli interests in other regions. Be alert to possible threats. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Border crossing points along the Thailand-Cambodia border continue to be closed at short notice. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. Border areas near Cambodia, Myanmar and Malaysia are dangerous due to violence, armed conflict and landmines. Pay close attention to your personal security.
* Anti-government protests have previously occurred in Bangkok and other areas of Thailand. There may be further protests in the future. The security environment can be unpredictable and turn violent. Those attending protests can face arrest or other legal consequences.
