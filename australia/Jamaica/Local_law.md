# Local law

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Same-sex relationships

Same-sex relationships are illegal and aren't widely accepted.

Verbal and physical aggression can happen towards people in a same-sex relationship.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. You can be sent to prison for carrying illegal drugs, including marijuana.

In April 2015, legislation came into force to decriminalise possession of small amounts of marijuana. However, possession of up to 2 ounces will still be punishable by a fine of JMD500, payable within 30 days. Anything over this amount can result in arrest, charge and court trial.

You'll be screened for drugs when you leave Jamaica.
