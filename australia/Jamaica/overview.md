## Overview

### Safety

* Violent crime is a serious problem. Crimes include gang-related armed robbery and murder. Be alert. Don't carry valuables. Avoid walking alone or on beaches at night.
* If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Criminals are often armed. You could be killed or seriously injured.
* Avoid Mountain View Avenue when going to and from Norman Manley International Airport.
* Food and drink spiking happens. This can lead to sexual assault, robbery and other crimes. Don't leave your food or drink unattended.
* Crime often occurs on public transport and in unofficial taxis. Use only established tour operators and registered taxis.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. You can be jailed for having illegal drugs. You'll be screened for drugs when leaving Jamaica.
* Jamaica has decriminalised the possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana. You will be fined, but it won't result in a criminal record. Anything over this amount can result in arrest, charge and court trial. Smoking marijuana in public places is still prohibited. Any attempt to take marijuana in or out of the country may lead to a serious charge of drug trafficking.
* Jamaican law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Those convicted can face sentences of up to 10 years in prison, though authorities rarely enforce the law. However, there are continued reports of serious discrimination and abuse against LGBTQIA+ individuals.
* Public nudity and swearing are illegal. It's also illegal to buy, sell or wear camouflage-style clothing.
* The law requires you to wear an appropriate helmet on a moped, motor scooter or motorbike.
* Jamaica has the death penalty for serious crimes, such as murder.
