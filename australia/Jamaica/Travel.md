#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You won't need a visa to enter Jamaica if your visit is for either:

* tourism, if you're staying for less than 6 months, or
* business, if you're staying for less than 30 days

In other situations, apply for a visa through a [Jamaican Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/98).

From 1 September 2023, all travellers to Jamaica are required to complete the Immigration / Customs C5 Form online before arrival in Jamaica.  The C5 online form is free of charge and can be completed before your journey via the [Government of Jamaica Passport Immigration Citizenship Agency (PICA) website](https://enterjamaica.com/).

Visa and other entry and exit conditions, such as customs and quarantine regulations, can change at short notice. Contact a Jamaican embassy for details.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you must also meet US entry and transit requirements. This includes transit through Hawaii or another US point of entry.

Check your visa requirements with a [US Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/212/State) before travelling.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Jamaican Dollar (JMD).

Declare all currency when you arrive. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Only change money at commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

Tourist spots in major towns accept international credit cards. Before you travel, ask your bank if your cards will work in Jamaica.

ATMs aren't widely available outside Kingston and Montego Bay.

Only use ATMs in safe places, such as hotels. Criminals target people using ATMs on the street.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Jamaica, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Jamaica than in Australia.

Night-time driving is especially dangerous.

Driving hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads
* speeding
* pedestrians and people selling things on roads

Weather conditions can make some roads impassable.

Authorities can close roads at short notice, including for security reasons. See [Safety](#safety)

Breakdown assistance is limited in urban areas and unavailable in rural areas.

By law, you must wear a seat belt in cars and taxis.

If you plan to drive in Jamaica:

* check you have the right travel insurance cover
* check local traffic laws and practices
* avoid driving at night, especially outside of Kingston, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay and Negril
* take the South Camp Road (the 'hummingbird route') when driving between Norman Manley International Airport and Kingston
* avoid Mountain View Avenue

Get up-to-date advice on road closures and curfews. See [Safety](#safety)

#### Motorcycles

Always wear a helmet. It's a legal requirement, and applies to mopeds, motor scooters and motorbikes.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you for riding a motorcycle, quad bike or similar vehicle.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and limousines, preferably arranged through your hotel. Travellers using unofficial taxis have been robbed and assaulted.

Use taxis authorised by the Jamaican United Travellers' Association (JUTA). You can order JUTA taxis at hotels or via a uniformed attendant at the airport.

To protect yourself from [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and overcharging:

* use registered taxis
* avoid unlicensed private taxis
* agree on the fare in advance

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport. It's not safe due to high levels of crime and overcrowding.

#### Boat travel
