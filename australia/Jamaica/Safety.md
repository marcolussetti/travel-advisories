Criminals have targeted travellers after accepting spiked food or drink, including in tourist resorts.

Travellers have reported [assaults](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault) carried out by resort staff and other travellers.

Most hotels and resorts are well-guarded but always lock your doors and windows.

To protect yourself from crime:

* always be alert to your surroundings
* stay somewhere safe with good security
* only use ATMs in hotels, shopping centres or other controlled areas during the day
* be aware of who's around you when using ATMs
* arrange transport to/from the airport in advance
* avoid travelling alone, especially at night
* avoid beaches at night
* don't leave your food or drink unattended
* never accept food, drink, gum or cigarettes from strangers or people you've just met

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Criminals are often armed, and you can be seriously injured or killed.

#### Travelling by Road

You're more likely to be robbed when travelling to and from Norman Manley International Airport at night.

Gang violence along Mountain View Avenue has led to motorists being shot in the crossfire.

You can be robbed and assaulted after accepting rides from strangers or using unofficial taxis.

To protect yourself while on the road:

* use established tour operators or taxis authorised by the Jamaican United Travellers' Association.
* don't share taxis or use public transport
* don't accept rides from strangers
* be wary of approaches from 'friendly' strangers
* avoid using Mountain View Avenue when travelling to and from Norman Manley International Airport

See '[Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/jamaica#travel)'.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, including bag snatching, pickpocketing and theft, is common. Old Kingston and overcrowded public transport are hotspots for pickpockets and bag snatchers.

Thefts from hotel room safes by hotel staff can occur in large resorts.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* always lock hotel doors and windows
* use the hotel safe to lock away your valuables
* check your accommodation has a high level of security, especially in villa-style hotels
* don't put valuables in your checked luggage, carry them with you
* keep doors locked, windows up, and valuables out of sight, even when moving.

#### Scams and fraud

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Jamaica. Scams are often initiated through internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Never send money to someone who calls to say you have won the lottery in Jamaica. Do not travel to Jamaica to collect a "prize."

You may experience credit card or ATM fraud. To protect yourself from fraud:

* only use ATMs during daylight hours in hotels, shopping centres or other controlled areas
* always keep an eye on your credit card when shopping, including at supermarkets

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Authorities may impose a State of Emergency or other measures in an area affected by security problems with little warning. Such measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations. Avoid affected areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Security forces have increased rights to conduct searches, seizures, and detain persons of interest when a state of emergency is in effect. Authorities can set curfews with little or no notice. Expect road closures and travel delays.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Kingston is a hotspot for this activity. Firearms may be used.

Demonstrations can happen without notice along the roads leading to Norman Manley International Airport. Roadblocks are often set up.

Authorities can close roads and impose curfews at short notice.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid large gatherings and protests
* monitor the media for reports of road closures, curfews and possible unrest
* be ready to change travel plans in case of road closures or curfews
* follow advice from local authorities

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

The Caribbean hurricane season is from June to November. Tropical storms and hurricanes can occur in other months. The direction and strength of hurricanes can change suddenly. The region is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

Landslides, mudslides and flooding can also occur. Essential services, such as water and electricity, might be affected.

If you're travelling to Jamaica during hurricane season, check if severe weather has affected tourist services.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available

Severe weather may also affect:

* access to ports
* road travel
* essential services, such as water, electricity and communication systems

To protect yourself if a hurricane is approaching:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* identify your local shelter
* monitor local media and advice from the [US National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with your friends and family

#### Earthquakes

Jamaica is in an active [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) zone.

Get to know the earthquake safety measures for each place you stay and visit.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis may occur in Jamaica. A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a tremor or earthquake. Be alert to warnings.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](https://www.gdacs.org/gdacsregister) to receive tsunami alerts.

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards or may not maintain safety equipment, including for scuba diving.

Operators may not take recommended safety precautions or meet maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* use only well-known, registered tour operators
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
