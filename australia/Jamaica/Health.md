#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Jamaica. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common in Jamaica. Take appropriate precautions if engaging in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is found in Jamaica, but it's not widespread. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss your travel plans with your doctor
* reschedule non-essential travel to affected areas

The risk of contracting insect-borne illnesses increases in the wet season from June to December. These include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)

To reduce your risk of diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or bad headache.

#### Other health risks

Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases can occur. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [leptospirosis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/leptospirosis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw or undercooked food
* get vaccinated before you travel

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Standards in public hospitals in tourist areas and in Kingston are reasonable. Medical care is limited in smaller towns and rural areas.

Emergency medical services are provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade.

Costs for treatment can be high. You'll have to pay cash or give a credit card imprint at hospitals and private medical facilities before a doctor will treat you.

Public hospitals may only need a deposit if you're covered by health insurance.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to Miami or another place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

If a death occurs in Jamaica, a death certificate can take several weeks or even months to be issued.

There's a hyperbaric chamber in the University of the West Indies Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory.
