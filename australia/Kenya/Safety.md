#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing high threat of terrorist attacks in Kenya.

Terrorist group al-Shabaab continues to threaten attacks. Further attacks are possible and could happen at any time, including in areas popular with foreigners and tourists. Kenyan authorities remain on high alert.

Terrorist acts could include:

* suicide bombings
* shootings
* [kidnappings](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* roadside bomb attacks and improvised explosive devices
* attacks on civil aviation

#### Possible attack targets

An attack could happen anywhere in Kenya. An attack is possible at any time.

Historically there has been an upsurge in terrorist activities and heightened threat warnings around religious and festive holidays as well as anniversary dates of previous attacks, such as 11 September, the 21 September Westgate Mall attack and the 7 October Hamas attack against Israel. Remain vigilant if visiting public areas.

Areas prone to terrorist attacks include:

* Nairobi
* Coastal areas, including all of Lamu County, and areas of Tana River and Kilifi Counties, extending 65km inland in Tana River County and 50km inland in Kilifi County north of the Galana-Sabaki River
* Kenya's border regions with Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan, including all of Mandera and Garissa counties and the part of Wajir county extending from the town of Wajir eastwards to the border with Somalia

Terrorists may target:

* shopping areas, including malls and markets
* bars, nightclubs, restaurants and cafes
* foreign embassies, UN premises and international schools
* hotels, tourist resorts, beaches and safari lodges
* places of worship
* offices of non-government organisations (NGOs) and government buildings, including educational institutions
* refugee camps

Terrorists may also target transport and transport infrastructure such as:

* airports and commercial airlines
* transport hubs and infrastructure
* sea vessels in or near Kenyan ports

Foreign aid workers may be targeted at refugee camps near the Kenya-Somalia border.

Terrorist attacks have occurred in Kenya in the past few years, including in Lamu, Mandera and Garissa counties.

#### Security

Consider likely terrorist targets and the level of security provided.

Always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

Report any suspicious items or activities to police.

To reduce your risks:

* take official warnings seriously
* monitor the media for threats
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This also applies if you're evacuated from a building for security reasons, such as a bomb threat.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protests and large gatherings are common. Security forces may use rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannons and, at times, live ammunition, which can result in fatalities and injuries. Expect road closures and traffic disruption, including to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Opportunistic crime can occur on the margins of protests, including looting, robberies and assaults.

Large demonstrations can happen in Kenya during and after international events, unpopular government policy decisions or political changes. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Violent outbreaks are more common away from tourist areas. However, riots and clashes have happened in:

* Mombasa
* Nairobi
* Kisumu
* other urban centres

During periods of unrest:

* be cautious throughout Kenya
* avoid large crowds, protests and demonstrations
* expect heavy security measures
* limit your movements and avoid affected areas, including areas around government buildings
* monitor the media for reports about unrest
* plan for interruptions to phone and internet services
* contact your airline or tour operator to confirm arrangements before you travel
* be aware authorities may order curfews in response to civil unrest at short notice
* follow instructions from local authorities

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
Several active terrorist groups have the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners. Armed groups from Somalia have kidnapped aid workers in the Somalia border region. Foreigners and residents have been the target of kidnapping in coastal resorts and towns in the North Eastern region (Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties), Lamu county and areas within Tana River and Kilifi Counties.

Kidnapping is a high threat in these regions for:

* humanitarian workers
* journalists
* tourists
* expats
* missionaries

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

Crime is high in most regions of Kenya, particularly in major cities such as Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, and at coastal beach resorts. Crime rates increase during holiday periods.

Incidents of [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery), carjacking and [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) are possible in:

* Nairobi and other urban centres (e.g. Mombasa)
* some coastal regions, including all of Lamu County, and areas of Tana River and Kilifi Counties
* North Eastern region (Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties)
* Some parts of North Rift and Central Rift regions (Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties)

There is a high crime rate in most regions of Kenya, particularly in major cities such as Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, and at coastal beach resorts. Crime rates are often higher around the Christmas and New Year period so take extra precautions at this time of year.

#### Petty crime

Groups of bag-snatchers and carjackers on motorbikes target pedestrians and motorists.

Thieves snatch jewellery and bags from open vehicle windows, most often while cars are stopped at traffic lights or in heavy traffic.

Robberies also occur on trains and buses.

To protect yourself from theft:

* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in ways that make them harder to snatch
* Take care crossing the street or walking along footpaths
* be aware of motorbikes approaching from behind as you walk on the footpath
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in ways that make them harder to snatch
* be prepared to surrender your valuables rather than risk being injured in a struggle
* always keep vehicle doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, even when moving
* secure your accommodation, even when you're inside
* avoid walking after dark
* avoid walking in isolated back-alleys and lanes

#### Violent crime

Violent crimes include:

* armed carjackings
* kidnapping
* home invasions

Foreigners have been targeted in private homes in Nairobi, tourist areas and while travelling by road. Incidents have also occurred at night outside residential security gates.

Violent crime is particularly common in the Nairobi suburbs of Eastleigh and Kibera. Take extra precautions in these areas.

If you're living in Kenya, invest in strong personal security measures. Regularly review your personal security arrangements.

Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.

Police regularly confront criminal suspects in public places. Random gunfire has killed or wounded bystanders in crowded areas.

Due to widespread HIV/AIDS, if you're a victim of violent crime such as [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), visit a doctor immediately.

#### Attacks and sexual assault

[Sexual assaults](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/resources/sexual-assault-overseas-factsheet) can affect both male and female travellers.

Victims of sexual assault may have difficulty receiving adequate social or medical support. While sexual assault is mostly frequently associated with females, sexual assault of men also occurs in Kenya and often goes unreported because of the stigma attached to this type of assault.

#### Crime in outlying areas

Incidents involving banditry and cattle rustling can occur in North and Central Rift regions (Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu counties).

Clashes between local groups have occurred in the Mount Elgon region in western Uganda.

The region bordering Somalia is extremely dangerous.

Curfews and security operations can be instituted without prior notice in the North Rift and parts of Central Rift regions.

If you plan to travel to these areas get up-to-date advice on security and other conditions from your tour operator before you travel. Monitor the media for latest developments, maintain a high level of vigilance and leave restricted areas as soon as possible.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) are common. Criminals often use fake police, hotel, government and other identification to extort money from travellers.

To protect yourself:

* be wary of demands for money or personal information, including from people claiming to be police or officials. Always ask for and carefully check identification
* be wary of fake bank notes in circulation

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Some criminals target foreigners with food and drink spiking. Their motivations can be for assault, including sexual assault, and theft.

To protect yourself:

* never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers
* be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### National parks and game reserves

Crime occurs Kenya's national parks and conservation areas but is rarely serious.

If you plan to visit national parks or game reserves:

* get local advice on security risks, park fees and other conditions before you travel
* get recommendations on travel firms and guides from the [Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO)](https://katokenya.org/kato-members-directory/)
* only use registered tour operators with a good reputation
* respect local wildlife laws and maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife
* follow all park regulations and instructions from local authorities and park wardens

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as diving.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers the activity
* use registered tour operators with a good reputation
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts.

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Kenya can experience [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* flash flooding
* mudslides
* drought
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [volcanic activity](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

If a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family.

#### Flooding

Kenya traditionally has two rainy seasons: from March to June and October to November. Flash flooding and mudslides are common. Roads may close. If flooding occurs:

* exercise caution
* monitor local news and weather reports
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Drought

Northern and eastern Kenya often experience drought. 

#### Earthquakes and volcanoes

Kenya lies on a fault line and sometimes experiences [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and tremors.

Volcanic activity and earthquakes can happen near Mt Elgon on the Kenya-Uganda border.

Get to know earthquake safety measures for each place you stay.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can occur in Kenya's coastal areas.

To receive tsunami alerts, register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Co-ordination System](https://www.gdacs.org/gdacsregister).

Move to high ground right away if local or regional authorities tell you to, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
