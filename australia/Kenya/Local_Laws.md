# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences can be severe and include long jail terms.

#### Dual citizenship

Kenya recognises dual nationality. However, Kenya has not yet fully enacted dual nationality laws.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

Kenya has conservative dress and behaviour standards, especially in coastal and rural areas. You should dress modestly; wear loose-fitting clothing that covers your shoulders, knees, midriff, chest and back. Take care not to offend.

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event") is observed in Kenya. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time. Muslims don't eat, drink or smoke between sunrise and sunset during Ramadan.  If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Public displays of affection can lead to harassment, particularly for same-sex couples.
