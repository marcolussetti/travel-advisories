#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Kenya. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Kenya.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any mpox symptoms.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread in Kenya. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitos. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel and take your yellow fever vaccination certificate with you to Kenya.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is widespread except in Nairobi and at altitudes above 2500m.

Other insect-borne diseases occur, including:

* [Dengue virus infection](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Rift Valley fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rift-valley-fever)
* [Lymphatic filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [African sleeping sickness](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trypanosomiasis-human-african-(sleeping-sickness))

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medication to prevent malaria

Visit a doctor if you develop either a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a bad headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection rates are very high.

Take precautions if taking part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [meningococcal disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about)

Serious outbreaks occur from time to time.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facility standards vary. Medical facilities are adequate in urban areas but may be extremely limited in other places.

Before receiving treatment, public and private facilities need:

* an up-front payment, or
* a payment guarantee, or
* medical insurance confirmation

If you become seriously ill or injured in a remote area, you'll need to be evacuated to a major city. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

There's a decompression chamber at the Kenyan Naval Base in Mombasa.
