# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise exercise a high degree of caution in Kenya overall due to the threat of terrorism and violent crime. Higher levels apply in some areas. Terrorist attacks could happen at any time, including in locations that are popular with foreigners and tourists (see 'Safety').   
  
Protests and large demonstrations are common, and security forces may be deployed in response. Avoid areas affected by protests, demonstrations or large public gatherings, as the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition has resulted in fatalities and injuries. Road closures and traffic disruptions may occur at short notice. Opportunistic crime, including looting, robberies and assaults, may occur. Avoid large gatherings, monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities (see 'Safety').

## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks could happen at any time, including in locations popular with foreigners and tourists. Be alert in public places, including shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, places of worship, as well as foreign embassies and refugee camps. Anniversary dates of previous attacks, as well as religious and festive holidays, may be of higher concern. Remain vigilant if visiting public areas.
* Kidnapping is a risk across Kenya. The borders with Somalia, Ethiopia and South Sudan are high-risk areas. Armed groups from Somalia kidnap and target foreigners in Kenya, including aid workers, particularly along the Somalia border region. Foreigners have previously been the target of kidnappings. If, despite our advice, you plan to travel to these areas, get professional security advice.
* Protests and large demonstrations are common. Security forces may be deployed in response. The use of rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannons and, at times, live ammunition has resulted in fatalities and injuries. Expect road closures and traffic disruptions if there is a protest. Access to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport may be affected. Opportunistic crime, including looting, robberies and assaults, can happen around the protest area. If there is a protest, demonstration or large public gathering, avoid affected areas, limit your movements and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Violent crime occurs, including carjackings, kidnapping and home invasions. Don't walk around after dark. If you live in Kenya, invest in strong personal security measures.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Scams are common. Criminals often use fake police, hotel or government identification to extort money from travellers. Be wary of anyone asking for money or information, even if they seem official.
* Kenya can experience natural disasters and severe weather. Know the warning signs and safety measures for earthquakes, floods and tsunamis.

### Health

* There's currently an outbreak of mpox in parts of Africa, including in Kenya. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* Malaria is widespread, except in Nairobi and places higher than 2500 metres above sea level. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases including dengue, Rift Valley fever, filariasis and African sleeping sickness are common. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Yellow Fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel and bring your vaccination certificate with you.
* HIV/AIDS infection rates are high. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* You may be exposed to foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases, including hepatitis, meningococcal disease, measles, cholera and mpox. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

### Travel

* Strikes at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi can occur without notice. Check with your airline or travel provider before you travel, and arrive early at the airport to ensure you have enough time to clear security and immigration.

* If you're a foreign resident, always carry your alien identity card. You could be fined or detained if you don't. If you're coming from a yellow fever-endemic country, you'll need to show a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Kenya.
