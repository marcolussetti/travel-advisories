#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

To enter Kenya you'll need to apply online  and pay for an [Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en) prior to arrival. Check the [Kenya State Department of Immigration and Citizen Services](https://immigration.go.ke/) for information on categories of persons exempted from applying for the ETA.

For Kenyan visa and permit information, visit the [ETA Kenya](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en)and [Kenya Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/sites/default/files/publication/visa_free_regime_in_kenya.pdf) websites.

Entry and exit requirements can change at short notice. Contact the [Kenyan High Commission in Australia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/102) for details about ETAs, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

If you enter Kenya with flu-like symptoms, you may need to take a COVID-19 test at your own expense. If your test is positive, you may need to isolate. For more information on COVID-19 travel requirements see: [Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.kcaa.or.ke/travel-to-kenya/covid-19).

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

Yellow Fever is widespread. If you're coming from a [yellow fever-endemic country](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/travel-and-health/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission.pdf?sfvrsn=bf42ac59_4&download=true), you'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Kenya, or transit through Kenya for 12 hours or longer. Some airlines may want to see a certificate when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

To enter Kenya, your passport must have an expiry date at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least two blank pages. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over. 

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy, high commission or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [Kenyan High Commission](https://www.kenya.asn.au/) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
