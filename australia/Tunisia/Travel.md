#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian citizens don't need a visa if visiting Tunisia for 90 days or less.

For other types of travel, obtain a visa before you arrive.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You can contact the [Embassy of Tunisia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/203) for the latest details.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest[embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Tunisian Dinar (TND).   
  
Tunisian foreign exchange regulations are strict and complex. It's illegal to import or export Tunisian dinars. You must declare all foreign currency on arrival/departure/while in transit in Tunisia equal to or greater than 20,000 TND. Keep the declaration receipt for departure.  
  
If you enter Tunisia with a sum exceeding 5,000 TND, you must declare the amount to airport customs so that any excess amount is not confiscated when you leave the country.  
You will not be allowed to leave Tunisia with the equivalent of 30,000 TND or more, even if you have declared it upon entry.  
  
You can exchange most major foreign currencies for TND at authorised banks or dealers. Australian dollars are unlikely to be accepted. Make sure you keep receipts.  
  
When you leave Tunisia, you can convert TND into foreign currency if you declared the amount on arrival. Keep receipts for your customs declaration.  
  
Limits on foreign currency imports and exports can change at any time.

An experienced guide may reduce the risks associated with travel in the Sahara.
