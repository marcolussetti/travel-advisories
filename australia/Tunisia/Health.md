#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Tunisia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Standards of medical facilities in Tunisia's major centres are generally good. Medical services in smaller cities and rural and remote areas are limited. 

Most staff in hospitals speak French or Arabic, not English.

Hospitals or doctors require payment in advance before they'll treat you, even in an emergency. Even with proof of insurance, you may be required to pay up front.

You may need initial treatment or assessment at a public hospital before you can go to a private clinic.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

There is a decompression chamber at the Naval Base in Bizerte in north-east Tunisia.
