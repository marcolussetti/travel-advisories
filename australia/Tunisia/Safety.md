#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in Tunisia.

Terrorists have previously targeted:

* tourists
* tourist sites
* religious sites
* government and security forces

Recent incidents include:

* 9 May 2023: a fatal shooting occurred on the island of Djerba, close to where Tunisian and international visitors were taking part in the annual Jewish pilgrimage at the El Ghriba synagogue. Three security personnel and two civilians were killed, and ten other people were injured.
* 24 June 2022: two security officers were injured in a knife attack near a synagogue in central Tunis.
* 29 January 2022: three passengers on a tram in Tunis were injured after a knife attack.

A state of emergency was declared in 2015 and remains in effect until further notice. The state of emergency grants authorities and security forces exceptional powers against threats of terrorism or organised crime, and allows them to:

* conduct searches
* make seizures
* detain persons of interest
* impose curfews

If you’re travelling in an area where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for updates

Tunisian authorities have increased security, including:

* security on the streets
* armed guards at tourist resorts
* security screening at hotels

Authorities often arrest and disrupt militants planning attacks.

Targets for future terror attacks could include:

* government buildings
* schools
* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* public places such as tourist attractions, stadiums, restaurants, bars, cafes, shopping malls, markets, hotels and other places frequented by foreigners

Be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be especially vigilant during:

* sporting events
* religious holidays
* public celebrations
* major political events, such as elections

The safety situation is unstable in Libya and Algeria. This has led to unstable security in Tunisia, particularly near the borders.

Tunisian authorities have designated certain areas as 'military operations zones', where the army patrols to counter terrorist threats and attacks. These zones mainly include the central-western mountain ranges in the governorates of Kasserine and Kef, including:

* Mount Chaambi National Park
* Mount Mghila
* Mount Selloum
* Mount Sammama

Avoid all travel to fenced off military zones.

To protect yourself from terrorist threats:

* consider the level of security at known terrorist targets and have a clear exit plan
* always be alert to possible threats around you
* report suspicious activity or items to police
* monitor local media and other sources
* take official warnings seriously

If there's a terror attack or threat:

* leave the affected area as soon as it's safe
* follow the advice of local authorities
* avoid gathering in a group.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There's a threat of kidnapping in some areas of Tunisia, including along the borders with Algeria and Libya. We advise you do not travel to those areas.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

### Protests

Protests, demonstrations and strikes can occur with little or no warning in response to political or economic issues. Although demonstrations take place throughout the country, they are mainly concentrated in downtown Tunis.

Strikes may affect essential services including ground and air transport. Avoid protests and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.

A state of emergency was declared in 2015 and remains in effect until further notice. The state of emergency grants authorities and security forces exceptional powers against threats of terrorism or organised crime.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid all demonstrations, protests and large public gatherings
* monitor local media and other sources
* avoid activities on days of national or commemorative significance
* be alert during the Friday prayer period
* follow the advice of local authorities
* carry your passport at all times

Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of civil unrest.

If you're affected by transport disruptions, you can contact your:

* airline
* travel agent
* travel insurer

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime in Tunisia includes:

* [theft](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers")
* pickpocketing
* bag snatching

Thieves sometimes steal high-value items from vehicles and hotel rooms. Don't leave valuables in a parked vehicle or unsecured in a hotel room.

Women travelling alone may be harassed, including unwanted physical contact and comments.

Take care when travelling alone or at night.

To reduce your risk of crime:

* be alert to pickpockets and bag snatchers, particularly in tourist areas
* be wary of friendly strangers
* be alert to possible scams.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking happens. To reduce your risk of drink spiking:

* be careful of people who approach you in bars, clubs and casinos
* don't accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers or new friends
* don't leave food or drinks unattended

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Tunisia experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* dust and sandstorms
* heavy rains and flooding

Flash flooding can block roads, particularly in the south.

During a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact with your friends and family
* monitor the media and other local sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
