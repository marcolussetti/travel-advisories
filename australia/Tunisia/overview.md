## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks are an ongoing risk in Tunisia, including at tourist and religious sites. Local authorities have increased security. Be alert to possible threats.
* Instability in Libya and Algeria has resulted in greater volatility in southern Tunisia. There's a kidnapping risk in the border regions. If despite our advice you plan to travel to these areas, seek professional security advice.
* Civil unrest is common. Protests, demonstrations and strikes can occur with little or no warning and can become violent, especially on days of national significance and around Friday prayers. Avoid all protests and large gatherings. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* A state of emergency was declared in 2015 and is regularly extended. It remains in effect until further notice. The state of emergency grants authorities and security forces exceptional powers against threats of terrorism or organised crime. It allows actions such as preventative arrests, banning strikes or meetings and control of media. For more information see the 'Civil unrest and political tensions' section.
* Petty crime, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching, occurs. Don't leave valuables in parked cars or unsecured in your hotel room.
* Drink spiking happens. Don't accept food, drink, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Don’t leave your food or drinks unattended.
* Women may be harassed on the street. Take care when travelling alone or at night.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases are common, including leishmaniasis and West Nile fever. Use insect repellent. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Other infectious diseases include typhoid, hepatitis and rabies. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Avoid ice cubes.
* If a dog, monkey or other mammal bites or scratches you, get medical help at once.
* Medical facilities in Tunisia's major centres are generally of a good standard. French and Arabic are the main languages. Not many staff speak English. Medical care can be expensive and payment is usually required before treatment is given. Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance before you travel.
