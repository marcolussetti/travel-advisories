# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include mandatory prison sentences.

#### Local customs

#### Cultural Sensitivities

There are conservative standards of dress and behaviour in Tunisia. Take care not to offend.

If you're visiting religious sites or remote areas of Tunisia, avoid wearing short-sleeved garments or shorts.

Women may be harassed, particularly if they're unaccompanied.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Tunisia. This may affect government and private business opening hours. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Explore our [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### Dual citizenship

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

If you're a dual national, you may need to complete national service in Tunisia.

Check with the [Embassy or Consulate of Tunisia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/203) before you travel.
