# Safety

#### Crime

Violent crime is rare.

Car theft and car break-ins can occur. New or expensive vehicles are targeted.

Pickpocketing and bag snatching can occur. Most petty theft occurs on public transport and in bars and restaurants.

To protect yourself from crime:

* avoid walking alone at night
* keep car doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight
* use guarded car parks where possible

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

#### Crime on public transport

[Scammers](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") target travellers on trains. They befriend travellers and ask personal questions to work out if they're worth robbing.

If you have concerns about your safety while on public transport, seek help from a transport employee.

File a police report at the nearest police station if you're a victim of crime. Get a copy of the report.

The Lithuanian police can provide translators (see'Local contacts').

#### LGBTQIA+ safety

Social acceptance of LGBTI people is not as widespread as in Australia. Individuals have sometimes been harassed. Public displays of affection may attract unwanted attention.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people are rare but can turn violent.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid crowds, protests and demonstrations where possible
* monitor developments in the media
* follow advice from local authorities

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Lithuania, they can still happen.

Terrorists have attacked some European cities. Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Lithuania can experience [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including extremely low winter temperatures.

Be careful when driving. Use winter tyres or chains.

Watch the media and other local news sources for weather advice, and be prepared.
