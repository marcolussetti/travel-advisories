# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, even when you only have small amounts, include heavy fines and imprisonment.

#### Driving laws

The blood alcohol limit is 0% up to 0.04%, depending on your driving experience and the type of vehicle being driven. Do not drink and drive. Severe penalties for drink-driving include:

* heavy fines
* imprisonment
* losing your driver's licence

#### Surrogacy

There are no legal or regulatory policies on surrogacy in Lithuania. Seek independent legal advice. 

The Australian Embassy in Warsaw (accredited to Lithuania) can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics

#### Other laws

You're required by law to carry ID with you at all times. You must present your ID to law enforcement officers when requested.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Lithuania recognises dual nationality. If you’re a Lithuanian-Australian dual national, there are limited [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide if you're arrested or detained.

Lithuanian males aged 18 and above have military service obligations. You may have to do military service if you're a male Australian-Lithuanian dual national. This applies even if you're of Lithuanian descent and were born outside Lithuania.

If in doubt, contact the nearest [Lithuanian Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/116) to check your dual nationality status. 

Always travel on your Australian passport to and from Australia.
