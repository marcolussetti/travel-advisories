### Local laws

* You're required by law to carry ID with you at all times. You must present your ID to law enforcement officers when requested.
* Penalties for drug offences are severe. Don't use or carry illegal drugs.
* Lithuania recognises dual nationality. If you’re a Lithuanian-Australian dual national, there are limited consular services we can provide if you're arrested or detained.

### Travel

* Lithuania is part of the [Schengen area,](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") meaning you can enter without a visa in some cases. In other situations, you'll need to get a visa.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Entry requirements can change at short notice. See the website of the [Consular Information Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania](https://keliauk.urm.lt/en/entry-to-lithuania) for the latest entry information.
* Rules apply to children who live in Lithuania and are travelling alone, with an unrelated adult and in some instances, with one parent. A consent letter from at least one parent is required.

### Local contacts

* The [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") details what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.
* The Australian Consulate in Vilnius provides some consular help but doesn't issue passports or perform notarial work. For full consular help, contact the [Australian Embassy](https://poland.embassy.gov.au/wsaw/home.html) in Warsaw.
* To stay up to date with local information, follow the Embassy's social media accounts.
