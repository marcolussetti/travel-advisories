#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Lithuania is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning Australian citizens can enter Lithuania without a visa in some cases. Always carry your passport even within the Schengen area.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Lithuanian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/116) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

You will require a Russian visa for entry via the Curonian Spit, and you should be aware of visa requirements when entering or departing through [Belarus](/destinations/europe/belarus "Belarus"). Visa requirements for Belarus differ depending on whether travel is by air or road.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Lithuania](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/116) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

#### Travelling with children

A consent letter from at least one parent is required if a [child](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") lives in Lithuania and is:

* is travelling alone
* or with an unrelated adult

In certain situations, a child travelling with only one parent may also be required to have a consent letter from the other parent or have other documentation, such as a court order.

The letter must be notarised by a Lithuanian notary or a [Lithuanian Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/116). 

Any adult accompanying the child must have their details in the letter, including their:

* names
* dates of birth
* personal ID numbers (if relevant)
* passport numbers and ID cards (if relevant), including the issuing authority, issue date and expiry date

#### Travel insurance

If you're a non-EU citizen visiting Lithuania, you must show proof of valid [travel insurance.](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance")

If you arrive without travel insurance, you may have to buy it at the border.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Lithuania's official currency is the Euro.

Declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent if you travel between Lithuania and any non-European Union (EU) country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you fail to declare or you give incorrect information on entry or exit, authorities will fine you.

You should check with local authorities in the countries you're leaving, entering or passing through whether you must declare higher amounts of currency.

#### Local travel

#### Border crossings

You need a Russian visa to visit the southern portion of the Curonian Spit. The Spit is divided between Lithuania and the Russian Federation at the Nida border crossing. Travelling by road via the Curonian Spit will require a visa. 

If, despite our advice, you travel by road through Belarus, you'll also need a visa. Rules regarding visa requirements differ when flying directly into and out of Minsk. On 1 March, the Lavoriškės and Raigardas road border crossing points to Belarus were closed. Read the travel advice for [Belarus](/destinations/europe/belarus "Belarus").

Localised disruptions to some cross-border road and rail transport services can happen. 

Allow extra time to cover disruptions. 

Always carry your passport even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

#### Driving permits

To drive in Lithuania, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Permanent residents of Lithuania need to apply for a local licence. Refer to [The State Enterprise Regitra](https://www.regitra.lt/en/services/driving-licences).

#### Road travel

Driving in winter can be dangerous due to snow and icy conditions. Black ice on roads is a common hazard.

Snow clearing is efficient in cities. However, highways and roads in rural areas can be blocked for long periods.

By law, you must:

* use winter tyres from 10 November to 1 April
* always use headlights on low beam when driving
* have valid car insurance

Contact your car hire provider for updates on car rental requirements, including the minimum age.

#### Motorcycles

Lithuania has strict guidelines for motorbike use, including wearing helmets and reflective clothing.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxi

Use reputable taxi companies that use meters.

Private taxis may refuse to use meters and may overcharge you.

Look for the company logo before getting in. You decide whether or not to pay a tip.

#### Rail travel

In winter, heavy snow can disrupt train travel.

#### Public transport

Towns have limited public transport.

Have the right ticket to avoid fines.
