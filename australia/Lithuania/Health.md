#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you're a non-EU citizen, you must have travel insurance. If you don't have insurance, you may have to buy it at the border.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Lithuania. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Other health risks

Tick-borne diseases are a risk in forested areas. Ticks are common from March to November, and care should be taken when undertaking any outdoor activity, when camping and when in forest or farming areas. The Lithuanian Ministry of Health states ticks can lead to tick-borne Encephalitis or Lyme Borreliosis.

#### Medical care

Medical professionals are highly trained, and some speak English.

Private medical facilities are well-equipped. However, public facilities don't meet Australian standards.

Doctors and hospitals may require up-front payment before treating you.

In an emergency, you may need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
