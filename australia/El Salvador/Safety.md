# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty Crime

Petty crime is common, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. 

Take extra care of your valuables in~~:~~

* Airports
* Bus terminals
* Public transport
* Tourist areas

To prevent petty crime:

* Be alert after dark
* Avoid being on the streets alone
* Pay attention in crowded areas
* Use ATMs in daylight hours
* Withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks or shopping centres.

#### Violent crime

A State of Exception was declared in El Salvador on 30 March 2023 and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. While the State of Exception has resulted in a reduction in the rate of violent and gang-related crime, there's still a risk of violent crime. Follow the advice of local authorities.

Violent crime is common in El Salvador, including in the capital, San Salvador. Incidents include:

* murder
* [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* extortion and [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")
* carjacking

Crime can involve guns and violent street gangs. The risk of violent crime increases at night.

While crime rates have reduced, gang-related crime may affect you in El Salvador.

Criminals on motorbikes commit robberies. You may be targeted if you display signs of wealth. Express kidnappings also occur, where criminals force you to withdraw funds from ATMs.

Police and law enforcement can't always respond to the high levels of crime.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't walk outside or travel after dark
* pay close attention to your surroundings
* make sure your accommodation is secure
* avoid openly changing large amounts of money at border crossings
* don't travel alone or after dark
* don't use ATMs on the street

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Armed criminals may injure or kill you.

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get immediate medical attention. El Salvador has a high [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection risk.

#### Road-based crime

It can be dangerous to travel on roads outside San Salvador, especially at night. Criminals may target roads and highways, including the road to the international airport.

Criminals may follow you from the international airport to assault or rob you.

Violent attacks on vehicles, including buses, between El Salvador and Guatemala have been reported. The risk is greater on the Guatemalan side of the border.

Sometimes armed thieves target hikers in remote areas around volcanoes and national parks.

To protect yourself when travelling by road:

* plan to arrive or depart the international airport during the day
* keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* keep valuables out of sight
* avoid isolated locations
* only travel in tourist areas

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government’s longstanding policy is that it doesn’t make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Express kidnappings can occur in urban areas, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in El Salvador. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protests and demonstrations can happen.

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It’s illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in El Salvador.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* Avoid demonstrations, protests, and public gatherings
* Check the media for reports of unrest
* Follow advice from local authorities

If you see a protest, leave as soon as it’s safe.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.
