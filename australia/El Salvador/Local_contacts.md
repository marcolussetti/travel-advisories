Australia has a consulate in San Salvador, headed by an Honorary Consul. The consulate provides limited consular assistance to Australians in El Salvador. The Consulate can conduct passport interviews and provide provisional travel documents for emergency travel to the nearest Australian embassy.  The Consulate can’t issue Australian passports. You can get full consular assistance from the Australian Embassy in Mexico City.
