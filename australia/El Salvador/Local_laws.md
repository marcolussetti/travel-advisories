# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

Authorities will arrest you for illegal drugs if you're either:

* carrying even a very small amount of drugs, or
* with someone who's using them
* If you're found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, authorities will arrest you.
* Border officials may screen you for drugs, including on departure.

#### Other laws

If you injure or kill someone in a road accident, authorities may arrest or detain you for a local trial.

It's illegal to take photographs of official buildings. Check with local authorities before taking photos.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Avoid public displays of affection.

Same-sex relationships are legal in El Salvador, but the country is conservative.

Same-sex marriages aren't recognised in El Salvador.
