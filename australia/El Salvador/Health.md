#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in El Salvador. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Chikungunya](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya) is widespread in El Salvador.

During the wet season, you're more at risk of insect-borne illnesses, including:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is widespread in El Salvador.

Read the Australian Department of Health's [Zika virus bulletin](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) for advice on how to reduce your risk. If you're pregnant, the department recommends that you discuss travel plans with your doctor.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk in El Salvador.

Take steps to protect yourself if you're at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Common waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are basic across El Salvador.

You may need to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

Doctors will rarely agree to work with your travel insurer. You may need to be reimbursed after you pay cash for your treatment. Doctors may only speak Spanish.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to the US. Medical evacuation and treatment in the US can be very expensive.
