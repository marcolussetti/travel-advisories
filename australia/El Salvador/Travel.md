#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need to purchase a tourist card at the airport. This permits you to visit El Salvador for up to 90 days.

El Salvador is a member country to the Central American Border Control Agreement (CA-4), along with:

* [Guatemala](/destinations/americas/guatemala "Guatemala")
* [Honduras](/destinations/americas/honduras "Honduras")
* [Nicaragua](/destinations/americas/nicaragua "Nicaragua")

With a CA-4 tourist visa, you can travel freely by land between member countries within the 90-day period.

Your tourist card is dated from the first point of entry in any member country.

You can apply to extend the CA-4 visa before it expires at Centro de Gobierno in San Salvador. Call (+503) 2221 2111.

If you overstay the visa without an extension, you may be:

* fined
* forced to leave
* unable to enter other CA-4 member countries

If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the [Embassy of El Salvador](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/62) in Canberra for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

You must pay a departure tax to leave El Salvador. Your airline ticket may include the tax.

Some land border crossing points between El Salvador and neighbouring countries close at 6pm.

#### Travel via the United States

If you’re travelling through the US, ensure you meet all current US entry or transit requirements, even if you're only transiting.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

Depending on where you've travelled, you may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter El Salvador. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Travel with children

If you're [travelling with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children"), you may need to show proof of your legal relationship. This could be as a parent, custodian or someone with access rights.

A child travelling on a Salvadoran passport without 1 or both parents must have written consent from the absent parents to leave the country. A Salvadoran notary must sign these documents.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the US Dollar ($US). Exchange for other currencies isn't available.

Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador in September 2021. However, not all vendors accept Bitcoin and it is in the early stages of adoption.

Credit cards aren't widely accepted outside major centres. ATMs aren't reliable.

Only change money and use ATMs in banks, hotels or shopping malls (see '[Safety')](#safety).

#### Local travel

#### Tour Operators

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Driving permit

To drive in El Salvador, you need both:

* your valid Australian driver's licence
* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Stick to sealed roads and well-travelled paths.

[Road safety and driving](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety") in El Salvador can be dangerous.

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in El Salvador than in Australia.

Driving standards can change across the country. Car insurance is essential.

If you're in an accident, call 911 for the national police or the fire brigade. Wait for the authorities to arrive before you leave.

Roads between tourist locations are usually in good or acceptable condition.

Locals sometimes steal manhole covers, leaving large holes in the road.

Roads are unsealed in isolated areas, so a 4WD vehicle is a good choice.

If you plan to drive in El Salvador:

* check your insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* lock doors and keep car windows up, even when moving
* avoid travel at night

Try not to drive at night. Lock doors, keep windows up and take safety precautions. (See '[Safety')](#safety)

#### Landmines

In rural El Salvador, unmarked landmines and unexploded remnants of war are common. This risk increases in the Chalatenango and Morazán districts.

#### Motorcycles

Check your insurance before using a motorcycle, quad bike, or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines.

Arrange transport through your hotel, and book in advance if travelling at night.

#### Public transport

Public transport in El Salvador is often overcrowded and poorly maintained. This includes inter-city buses.

Security around bus stops is poor, and robberies are common.

Avoid using public transport.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [El Salvador's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YS) with the Aviation Safety Network.
