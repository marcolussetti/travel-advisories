## Overview

### Safety

* Mugging, armed robbery, pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Don't walk alone, especially at night. Robberies can occur on inter-city buses while passengers are sleeping. Keep valuables with you and check everything before you leave the bus. There's been an increase in scams targeting tourists (see 'Safety').
* Politically motivated demonstrations occur regularly, particularly in and around La Moneda (Presidential Palace), Plaza Baquedano (Plaza Italia), Lastarria and Bellavista in central Santiago and the centre of Valparaiso. Outbreaks of violence may occur at any time and have also occurred in the Santiago suburbs of Las Condes, Providencia and Vitacura, where the Australian and other embassies are located.
* There are political tensions and violent incidents in the Araucanía region and some provinces in the Biobio Region. Exercise caution if travelling in or near those regions.
* Local law prohibits political activity by foreign nationals. Participation in protests or demonstrations may result in detention or deportation. Avoid protests and large public gatherings. These can become violent. Authorities use tear gas and water cannons.
* Domestic terrorist acts sometimes occur, undertaken primarily by anarchist groups in Santiago. They may use explosives. Be alert and report anything suspicious.
* Natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding and tsunamis can occur. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
