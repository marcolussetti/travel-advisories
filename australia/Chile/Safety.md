# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

[Muggings and robberies](/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged "I've been robbed or mugged overseas") are common in urban areas.

Hot spots for thieves include:

* Santiago
* Viña del Mar
* Valparaiso
* Calama

Foreigners are targeted for their personal belongings, and people walking alone at night are more vulnerable. 

Muggings, including with weapons, occur in Santiago around:

* Cerro Santa Lucia,
* Cerro San Cristobal Park
* Plaza de Armas
* Mercado Central
* malls/shopping centres

Pickpocketing and bag snatching is common. Be aware in crowded areas, such as:

* public transport, including the metro system
* outdoor cafes
* markets
* resort areas
* hotel lobbies
* bars and restaurants
* malls/shopping centres

Keep your belongings close in the tourist areas of Santiago including:

* Plaza de Armas
* Mercado Central
* Barrio Lastarria
* Bellavista
* Costanera Centre Mall

#### Scams

Criminal groups often use distraction to rob tourists. Some examples of common scams are:

* an elderly person 'accidentally' drops some coins and when a tourist stops to help, a thief steals the tourist's bag
* thieves squirt a substance onto a tourist and steal their bag while helping them clean up ('bird poo' scam)
* tourists are quietly identified by thieves at the airport and followed to their hotels, where luggage theft or threats of assault and robberies can happen
* unofficial taxis may overcharge or rob tourists. You can hire official taxis at the booths before you exit the airport.
* rental cars can be a target for scams and thefts. Criminals may damage tires in order to rob passengers while they are pulled over. Make sure you pull over in a safe space, keep your car doors locked and do not accept assistance from strangers.

#### Violent crime

Robberies, [assaults](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas") and threats with weapons happen mainly at night. Take particular care:

* in taxis
* in Bellavista and Barrio Lastarria in Santiago

Carjackings can occur as residents leave their vehicles to open or close gates. They may also occur on highways near entry and exit ramps.

Tourists have been robbed on inter-city buses, particularly:

* from Calama to San Pedro de Atacama
* at the Calama and Santiago bus stations

Criminals have been known to hold up stores with weapons in major cities.

To reduce your risk of violent crime:

* avoid going out alone, especially at night
* book taxis by phone, particularly if travelling alone or at night
* keep your belongings close, especially in crowded places
* don't leave valuables in your checked luggage
* don't leave food or drinks unattended

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.   The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Large-scale demonstrations and protests might occur in Santiago and other cities. They can take place with little or no notice and may turn violent.

Local authorities have used tear gas and water cannons. Pay close attention to your personal security at all times and monitor the media about possible safety or security risks. Follow the instructions of local authorities.

Demonstrations and protests can result in public transport disruptions. Public transport may be limited. Contact your airline or tour operator to determine if the situation will disrupt your travel plans. 

In the Araucanía region, people claiming to represent the Mapuche community are fighting over land and indigenous rights, in which has seen a significant number of violent incidents (the Mapuche are Chile's largest indigenous group). A state of emergency has been declared in the ‘Macro Zona Sur' (provinces of Biobío, and Arauco, in the Biobio Region, and the Araucania Region) until further notice. The military has been deployed to assist regional police during this period. You should be cautious when travelling within the ‘Macro Zona Sur’.

In recent years, attacks have targeted multinational forestry corporations and private Chilean landowners.

To protect yourself:

* avoid all demonstrations, protests and large public gatherings
* be alert around days of national significance
