# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter.](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Chile doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") the Australian Government can provide if you're arrested or detained.

If you're of Chilean origin, you may be deemed a Chilean national under Chilean law. This may apply even if you've taken steps to renounce Chilean citizenship.

If you're considered a Chilean national under Chilean law, you may need to enter and exit Chile using a Chilean passport or ‘cédula de identidad’.

Different rules may apply to a child aged under 18 years who was born overseas to Chilean parents.

Confirm your citizenship status and entry and exit requirements with an [embassy or consulate of Chile](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/43) before you travel.
