#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Chile. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Altitude sickness

You’re at risk of altitude sickness if you travel above 2500m.

Altitude sickness can be life-threatening and can affect anyone, even if you're fit and healthy.

You're at greater risk of altitude sickness if you:

* ascend quickly or make rapid ascents at higher altitudes
* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before you get used to the altitude
* have lung problems that affect breathing

If you'll be travelling above 2,500m:

* see your doctor for specific advice
* check your insurance covers emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs

#### Insect-borne diseases

Outbreaks of [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) and [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) have occurred on Easter Island (Isla de Pascua/Rapa Nui). 

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to Zika virus affected areas

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Air pollution

High levels of smog and air pollution occur in Santiago throughout the year, but particularly from April to October.

High levels of dust often occur from December to March.

The Chilean Government regularly issues pre-emergency alerts for air pollution.

If you have breathing problems, take extra care when there's a pre-emergency alert for air pollution.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities at private hospitals in Santiago and other major cities are good but very limited elsewhere. Most private hospitals have some doctors who speak English, however nurses and and administrative staff often only speak Spanish.

Treatment at private clinics and hospitals is expensive and you may need to pay up front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency. Most large hospitals accept credit cards.
