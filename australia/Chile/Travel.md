#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

To enter Chile, you must obtain a visa before arrival: [E-visa for Australia | Consulado.gob.cl](https://www.consulado.gob.cl/servicios/e-visa-para-australia). The application process can be lengthy, so allow yourself enough time before your planned travel.

If you arrive in Chile without a valid visa, you won't be able to pass the immigration point. You won't be able to obtain a visa at the airport or border entry point.

If you applied for a single-entry visa, and you enter Chile to then travel to another country, you won't be able to use that visa to enter Chile again.

You can't stay on Easter Island (Isla de Pascua/Rapa Nui) for more than 30 consecutive days.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Embassy or Consulate of Chile](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/43) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Entering and departing Chile

When going through Immigration, you'll be given a tourist card. You must keep this card, as it will be requested at departure. If you lose it, you'll have to request a new one from Immigration, and your departure from Chile may be delayed. For more information on replacing your tourist card, visit the closest [International Police (PDI) Office](https://www.pdichile.cl/pdi-mas-cercano).

When entering Chile, you must complete the online [Customs (Aduanas) and Agro-sanitary (SAG) declaration](https://djsimple.sag.gob.cl) within 48 hours of arrival. Hardcopy declarations can be completed by hand in the paper forms near the luggage collection area.

If you're a dual-national (Australian-Chilean) or a resident of Chile, you may be required to enter and depart using your Chilean ID documents (Chilean passport, or Chilean 'cédula de identidad').

Chile's Migration Police (PDI) has denied the departure of dual nationals with expired Chilean passports. If you don't have a Chilean travel document upon entry, you can apply for one through [Registro Civil](https://www.registrocivil.cl/) while in Chile to facilitate your departure. 

Severe weather conditions in the Andes mountain regions may affect crossing into neighbouring countries by land. Check Chile's [Border Crossings](http://www.pasosfronterizos.gov.cl/) official website (in Spanish), subscribe to their WhatsApp [channel](http://www.pasosfronterizos.gov.cl/alertas/pasos/), and monitor local media before attempting to enter or leave the country by land. 

#### Transit through Chile

If your travel includes transiting through Chile, you should contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Chile](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/43) to confirm if you'll need a visa.

If you transit in Chile without a visa and miss your connecting flight, you won’t be able to pass the immigration point. You'll be required to remain airside and not leave the airport until a new onward flight has been arranged. Australians have previously been required to remain airside for several days due to missed flight connections.

#### Other Formalities

#### Travelling with children

If you're [travelling with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") aged younger than 18, you may need to show the original, and provide a copy, of the child's birth certificate, particularly if the parent and child don't share a family name.

The article '[E-visa para Australia'](https://serviciosconsulares.cl/tramites/e-visa-para-australia) outlines the requirements for minors under 18 years of age to enter Chile:

* minors must enter the country accompanied by their mother, father, guardian or person in charge of their personal care. Otherwise, they must have written authorisation from one of the minor's parents, from a Court or the competent Authority.
* the authorisation must be legalised by a [Chilean Consular](https://www.consulado.gob.cl/redes/chile-en-el-mundo) authority in the country of origin or include the corresponding apostilled certificate.
* they can also present a document recognised as valid by the Chilean border control authorities in virtue of the international agreements signed by Chile, which are currently in force.

A child aged under 18 years who isn't accompanied by one or both parents must carry 3 copies of the following:

* the legalised written authorisation certifying the agreement of any absent parents
* a copy of any court order conferring custody of the child, including sole custody (if relevant)
* Note: Read '[Notarial services'](/our-services/notarial-services/notarial-forms "Notarial forms") if you intend to apostille the authorisation with DFAT, as we can only apostille notarised documents serviced by an Australian Notary Public.

You also need a Spanish translation of the documents notarised no more than 3 months before travelling at either:

* the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Santiago by a Chilean consular officer, or
* a Chilean Embassy or Consulate

You can use the same document for entry and exit. If you fail to comply with the requirements, the child will not be allowed to enter or leave Chile.

A child aged under 18 years born overseas to Chilean parents can enter Chile on an Australian passport and remain for up to 90 days as a tourist (see 'Visas').

For stays longer than 90 days, the child must obtain a Chilean passport.

#### Passport

#### Validity

As outlined in the requirements for [temporary admission for Australian passport holders](https://www.consulado.gob.cl/informacion-sobre-visas-para-ingresar-a-chile), your Australian passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of arrival in Chile.

Some agencies and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Proof of identity

Always carry a clear copy of your Australian passport as proof of ID.

Keep your passport in a safe location when not being used.

You'll need to show your Australian passport when:

* banking
* booking a hotel or hostel
* travelling by air in Chile

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Chilean Peso (CLP).

Amounts higher than $US10,000 must be declared on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

US dollars can be readily exchanged throughout Chile.

Check your change as vendors, including taxi drivers, sometimes swap denominations to short-change travellers.

ATMs are widely available. Contact your bank to find out whether your cards will work in Chile. Credit cards are widely accepted.

#### Local travel

#### Border areas

If you're planning scientific, technical or mountaineering activities in areas classified as 'frontier areas', you need approval from the Chilean Government 90 days before travelling.

#### Unexploded mines

Anti-tank mines and landmines are a danger in national reserves and parks near northern borders, including:

* Lauca and Llullaillaco National Parks
* Salar de Surire National Monument
* Los Flamencos National Reserve

Be aware of unexploded weapons outside of military zones in the desert areas bordering Chile and Peru.

Take note of clearly marked landmine fields in the Magallanes region of southern Chile:

* between Punta Arenas and the Torres del Paine National Park
* in Tierra del Fuego

To avoid unexploded mines**:**

* seek advice from local authorities for these areas
* obey all warning signs
* stay on clearly identified roads

#### Driving permit

To drive in Chile as a tourist, you need either:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (which can function as a Chilean' [class B license](https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/fichas/24065-licencia-de-conducir-no-profesional-clase-b)', for non-commercial, small vehicle driving during the length of your tourist visa), or
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

If you do not have a valid Australian licence, you need to get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving in Chile can be dangerous.

Hazards for drivers include:

* aggressive local driving practices
* poorly maintained secondary and rural roads
* poor street lighting
* no guardrails on mountain roads

Chile has strict regulations related to driving with blood alcohol content. Penalties can include jail.

If you intend to drive in Chile:

* check local traffic laws and practices
* use chains on mountain roads during winter

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance policy may not cover you when riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet. Make sure your passenger does too.

#### Taxis

Prepaid official taxis are available at airports. To decrease the chances of scams or other taxi-related crimes, order official taxis from the counters at the airport.

To protect yourself from crime and overcharging:

* avoid hailing taxis on the street, particularly if travelling alone or at night
* ask your hotel to make a telephone booking for you
* make sure that the driver uses the meter

Rideshare apps are widely used, although not legal. Drivers may face fines or have their vehicle confiscated by authorities if stopped. Drivers may ask passengers to sit in the front seat to avoid detection. If this happens and you feel unsafe, cancel the booking and choose an alternative transport option. 

#### Public transport

Santiago has a well-developed metro and bus network. There is also a comprehensive bus and coach network across Chile.

Santiago and Valparaiso are served by commuter rail, but most destinations are difficult to access via railway.

Tourists on inter-city buses, particularly from Calama to San Pedro de Atacama, have been robbed while sleeping.

If you take public transport:

* don't store valuables in overhead lockers
* keep your valuables with you at all times
* check your belongings before you get off
