#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Australian citizens can now apply for the Global Entry program direct through [US Customs and Border Protection](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbp.gov%2Ftravel%2Ftrusted-traveler-programs%2Fglobal-entry%2Finternational-arrangements%2Faustralia%2Faustralian-citizens&data=05%7C02%7CRebecca.Elias4%40dfat.gov.au%7Cf9171186e0f44232692708dd36e596e6%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638727081889737388%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tu89mkleBtVaQtY%2BaLvVoRvXAUv5hdFCp3RVrAQ%2Bsp4%3D&reserved=0) (USCBP). The Global Entry program is a US Government program that allows faster border clearance entering the United States for some Australians subject to strict eligibility criteria. For more information see [Global Entry for Australians](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimmi.homeaffairs.gov.au%2Fentering-and-leaving-australia%2Fglobal-entry-program&data=05%7C02%7CRebecca.Elias4%40dfat.gov.au%7Cf9171186e0f44232692708dd36e596e6%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638727081889753176%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=x0abAOoc%2F0GACOQMTZHnWpPrH7kMskBtUzyzw1mxHa8%3D&reserved=0).

The United States has strict entry requirements. US authorities won't allow you to enter the country if you don't comply.

If you're visiting the United States for less than 90 days, you may be eligible to:

* apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and
* then enter under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP)

Otherwise, you'll need to get a visa before you travel.

Visa and other entry and exit conditions, including currency, customs and quarantine rules, can change at short notice. Contact your nearest [US Embassy or Consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/) for the latest details.

**More information:**

* [US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) - ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)
* [US Department of State - Visa Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html)

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

If you plan to visit the United States and/or its territories, including the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, for less than 90 days, you may be able to travel under the VWP. 

The VWP is intended for short, infrequent visits to the United States and can be used by tourists and business travellers. Conditions apply.

Ensure you know all terms and conditions before applying for your ESTA and attempting to enter the US under VWP.

If you don't satisfy US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at your port of entry that you're entitled to be admitted under the VWP, you may be denied entry and detained.

You can't enter the United States under the VWP if you have:

* been denied an ESTA or denied previous entry under the VWP
* been denied a US visa
* an emergency passport, document of identity or [Provisional Travel Document](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents)
* a criminal record
* been arrested but not convicted
* dual citizenship with Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan or Syria
* travelled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen since 1 March 2011, with limited exceptions
* travelled to Cuba since 12 January 2021 (see ‘Travel to Cuba’ below).

Before you can travel under the VWP, you must apply and be pre-approved via the ESTA.

US authorities recommend applying as soon as you know you'll be travelling. ESTA approvals can take up to 72 hours.

ESTAs are valid for 2 years and for multiple entries.

You'll need to apply for a new ESTA if:

* you renew your passport within the 2 years and/or
* your VWP eligibility changes

If there are differences between your ESTA, passport or ticket information, you could be:

* referred for secondary inspection (where a CBP officer may interview you) and/or
* refused entry

If your ESTA application is denied, you must apply for a visa from a [US Embassy or Consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/).

US authorities generally won't tell you why your ESTA application was rejected, and you can't appeal their decision.

If you provide false or incorrect information on an ESTA, you may be permanently banned from future travel to the United States.

**More information:**

* [US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) - ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)

#### Visas

If your ESTA application is denied or, you're not eligible to travel under the VWP, or you intend to stay for more than 90 days, you'll need to apply for a visa from a [US Embassy or Consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/).

The category of visa you need to apply for will depend on your reason for travel.

**More information:**

* [US Department of State - Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html)
* [Embassy of the United States of America in Australia](https://au.usembassy.gov/visas/)

#### Entry into the US

An approved ESTA or valid visa allows you to board a US-bound plane or vessel or request entry at a land border. It doesn't guarantee entry to the US.

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port of entry will decide if you can enter the country.

Entry requirements are strict. Authorities have broad powers when deciding if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law.

At the port of entry, be prepared to answer questions about:

* the purpose of your visit
* how long you plan to stay
* where you will stay
* your ties to Australia

Officials may ask to [inspect your electronic devices](https://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/inspection-electronic-devices-tear-sheet), emails, text messages or social media accounts. If you refuse, they can deny your entry.

Whether you enter the United States under the VWP or on a visa, you'll likely need to have:

* an onward or return ticket that doesn't terminate in Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean unless you're a resident of one of those countries, and,
* proof you have enough money to support yourself during your stay

You can be refused entry if you provide false information or can't satisfy the officials you're visiting for a valid reason.

You may be held at the port of entry or a nearby detention facility while US authorities arrange for you to be returned to Australia (or the last country you visited).

If you're refused entry under the VWP, you generally don't have the right to an attorney or to appeal the decision.

The Australian Government cannot intervene on your behalf, and our ability to provide consular assistance in these circumstances may be limited.

#### Arrival and departure record (Form I-94)

When you arrive at the port of entry, US authorities will determine your admissibility and decide when you must leave the country. This date may be different from the expiry date of your ESTA or visitor visa.

A US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official should:

* stamp your passport and write the date by which you must leave the United States
* issue you an electronic Form I-94 (Arrival/Departure Record)

Your I-94 is evidence of your legal status in the United States and shows the date by which you must leave the country.

You can [check your I-94 with CBP](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/) each time you enter the US.

If you stay past your I-94 expiry date, you can be detained, deported and banned from re-entering the United States.

#### Renewing your I-94 and/or extending your stay

You can't extend or renew your I-94 by travelling to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean for 30 days or less and then re-entering the United States.

If you travel to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean and return to the United States while your I-94 is still valid, you'll be readmitted for the amount of time left on it.

If your I-94 has recently expired and US authorities think the purpose of your trip outside the United States was only to be issued a new I-94 to extend your stay in the United States, they can:

* refuse you entry
* detain and deport you

If you're on a visa and need to extend your stay in the United States, lodge a request with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on [Form I-539](https://www.uscis.gov/i-539) before your I-94 expires.

VWP entrants are generally not eligible to extend their stay beyond 90 days or change their status.

If a serious emergency, such as hospitalisation, prevents you from departing before your I-94 expires, USCIS has the discretion to grant you additional time to leave. This is known as 'satisfactory departure'.

For further information, see [Immigration Relief in Emergencies or Unforeseen Circumstances](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/immigration-relief-in-emergencies-or-unforeseen-circumstances).

To request satisfactory departure, contact the [USCIS Contact Center](https://www.uscis.gov/contactcenter).

#### Health-related requirements

US authorities may deny boarding any US-bound traveller showing signs of illness.

Expect enhanced screening procedures, including for domestic flights within the United States.

For further information regarding precautions to take before and during travel to the United States and after arrival, visit the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC) website.

#### Other formalities

#### Biometrics

You'll have your fingerprints scanned and your face photographed when you arrive in the United States.

**More information:**

* [US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) - Biometrics](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics)

#### Children

Children of all ages must have their own ESTA approval or US visa.

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requires children under 18 years of age travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian to carry a letter of consent signed by both the travelling and non-travelling parent/s or guardian/s to help prevent delays due to further questioning at ports of entry and departure. CBP recommends that the letter is notarised.

#### Travel to Cuba

[The United States enforces restrictions on travel to Cuba](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions). This applies to anyone under US jurisdiction, including Australians who live or work in the United States.

The United States designated Cuba a ‘State Sponsor of Terrorism’ on 12 January 2021. If you’ve travelled to Cuba since 12 January 2021, you're not eligible to participate in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and must apply for a visa to enter the United States (see ‘Visa-free travel for short stays’ above).

If you enter the United States under the VWP and then travel to Cuba, you won’t be able to re-enter the United States under the VWP. You’ll have to apply for a US visa, even if you’ve arranged to just transit the United States to fly back to Australia.

If you have a US visa and plan to visit the United States after you’ve been to Cuba, you’ll also need documents to prove the purpose of your trip. Immigration officials may question you at the port of entry. 

**More information:**

* [Travel advice for Cuba](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/284)

#### Immigration enforcement

The United States has strict immigration laws. US authorities actively pursue, detain and deport people who are in the country illegally.

It’s common for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to carry out random travel document checks, including on public transport.

If you’re a tourist or visitor, be prepared to show your passport and entry stamp, ESTA or valid US visa, and a copy of your electronic [Form I-94](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/).

If you're living in the United States but not a US citizen, be prepared to show proof of legal residence, such as a US permanent resident card, valid US visa and electronic Form I-94, and US driver's licence issued by the state in which you live.

If you travel on an incorrect visa, breach the conditions of your ESTA or visa, or are found to be unlawfully present in the United States, you may be held at the port of entry or a nearby detention facility while US authorities arrange your return to Australia (or the last country you visited).

#### Passport

Australians entering the United States on their Australian passport need only have a passport valid for their intended period of stay. However, different rules may apply in countries you plan to transit or stop in on your way to or from the United States.

Be sure to check the entry requirements of all countries you intend to transit or visit on your trip.

Some countries won't let you enter or transit unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country.

You may be denied boarding and become stranded in these countries if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country.

Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the United States Dollar (USD).

Declare all amounts over USD $10,000 (or its foreign equivalent) on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only US dollars and not only cash. Failing to do so is a serious violation and can result in the seizure and forfeiture of your money. Criminal penalties can also apply.

Banks and ATMs are widespread throughout the United States, and currency exchange services are available in most major cities and airports.

Major credit cards are almost universally accepted. Contactless and mobile payment options are also readily available, particularly in cities and at most major retailers.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Speed limits and road rules vary between states and localities within states.

If you plan to drive in the United States:

* learn local traffic laws before you drive
* pay close attention to signs and other posted regulations
* check weather conditions before a long journey
* be cautious of snowfall in mountainous or isolated areas
* take extra water when driving through dry desert areas and in areas in which petrol stations can be scarce

* [Information for foreign nationals driving in the US](https://www.usa.gov/visitors-driving)

#### Driver's licences and International Driving permits (IDP)

While some US states will allow you to drive on your Australian driver's licence for a limited time, others require you to also have an International Driver's Permit (IDP).

You should obtain an IDP before you leave Australia.

Some rental car companies also require you to have an IDP.

Contact your rental car company and the motor vehicle department in each US state you intend to drive in for further information.

Driving without an IDP where one is required can void your travel and vehicle insurance.

**More information:**

* [US State Motor Vehicle Departments](https://www.usa.gov/motor-vehicle-services)

#### Motorcycles

You need a motorcycle licence to operate a motorcycle in the United States.

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike, ATV or similar vehicle, and always wear a helmet.

#### Electrically-powered personal vehicles

Rules relating to electric transportation, such as e-bikes and e-scooters, vary between localities. Learn local laws before hiring or using these items.

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using electric transportation, and always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis are plentiful in most cities and generally safe to use. Ridesharing options are also widely available.

Take the same safety precautions that you would in Australia.

#### Sea travel

The United States is home to most of the major cruise lines and some of the world's busiest cruise ports. 

Popular destinations for cruises originating and returning to or terminating in the United States include Alaska, Florida, the Caribbean and Central and South America. 

Before embarking on a cruise, take steps to be [prepared](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/cruises) and reduce the risk of things going wrong. This includes choosing a travel insurance policy that covers you for cruising and any activities you do on shore.

If you're embarking on a round-trip cruise to Canada, Mexico and/or the Caribbean, make sure your passport, ESTA or visa and I-94 will allow you to re-enter the United States (see Visas and border measures).
