# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you in accordance with our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Federal and state laws for drug-related offences vary, including laws related to the possession and recreational and/or medical use of marijuana (cannabis).

Penalties for drug-related offences can be severe and often include minimum mandatory sentences.

Some medications readily available in Australia are illegal or considered controlled substances in the United States, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

It's also illegal to possess any prescription medication without a prescription. See [Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/united-states-america#health).

#### Alcohol

The federal legal age for buying and drinking alcohol is 21 years old. State laws regarding the possession and consumption of alcohol can vary. Check the relevant state laws.

#### LGBTQIA+

No federal law explicitly protects LGBTQIA+ people from discrimination, and not all state and local non-discrimination laws include protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Some states and localities have laws that may discriminate against or otherwise affect LGBTQIA+ travellers. Check relevant state and local laws.

#### Abortion and reproductive health

Some US states have laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services.

Research local laws and always consult your doctor before making any decisions about your medical care.

#### International surrogacy

[Surrogacy laws](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/surrogacy) can be complex. Get legal advice before you agree to an arrangement.

#### Other laws

Some US states apply the death penalty for serious crimes. The death penalty can also apply to some serious federal offences, even if committed in states without capital punishment.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
