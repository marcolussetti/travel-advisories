## Overview

### Safety

* Avoid areas where demonstrations and protests are occurring due to the potential for unrest and violence. Monitor media for information, follow the instructions of local authorities and abide by any curfews.
* Violent crime is more common in the United States than in Australia. Gun crime is also prevalent. If you live in the United States, learn and practice active shooter drills.
* There is a persistent threat of mass casualty violence and terrorist attacks in the United States. Be alert, particularly in public places and at events. On 5 June 2025, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued an alert highlighting potential public safety concerns related to ongoing threats to the Jewish and Israeli communities.
* Severe weather and natural hazards include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, avalanches, hurricanes, tornadoes, winter storms, extreme temperatures, wildfires, and floods. Monitor weather conditions and follow the advice and instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders.

### Local laws

* Check local drug laws, including those related to the possession and recreational and/or medical use of marijuana. These vary between states. Penalties are severe and can include mandatory minimum sentences.
* Some prescription and over-the-counter medications readily available in Australia are illegal in the United States. It's also illegal to possess prescription medication without a prescription.
* The federal age for buying and drinking alcohol is 21, however, state laws regarding possession and consumption can vary. Check relevant state laws.
* Some states have laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Research local laws and consult your doctor before making any decisions about your medical care.
* There's no federal law that explicitly protects LGBTQIA+ people from discrimination. Some US states and localities have laws that may affect LGBTQIA+ travellers.
* Some US states apply the death penalty for serious crimes. The death penalty can also apply to serious federal offences, even if committed in states without capital punishment.

### Travel

* Australian citizens can now apply for the Global Entry program direct through US Customs and Border Protection (see 'Travel' below).
* Entry requirements are strict. US authorities have broad powers to decide if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law. Check US entry, [registration](https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration), transit and exit requirements.
* A passport or United States-issued photo identification which meets the Department of Homeland Security’s [REAL ID requirements](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dhs.gov%2Freal-id&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7Cdc919ac9ef40422f5f6608dd8b66489d%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638819993608417970%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=eyTlM6%2Be%2F1usiud%2FfmzlUQVJ3MyKQBT5iXBDfydxFFk%3D&reserved=0) is required to board domestic flights in the United States.
* If you're visiting for less than 90 days, you may be eligible to apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). If not, you'll need to get a visa before you travel. Whether you're travelling on a visa or under the VWP, ensure that you understand all relevant terms and conditions before attempting to enter the US.
* An approved ESTA or valid visa doesn’t guarantee entry to the United States. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port of entry will determine your eligibility. If CBP denies your entry, you may be held at the port of entry or a nearby detention facility while US authorities arrange your return to Australia (or the last country you visited).
* Expect enhanced screening procedures, including for domestic flights within the United States. You can be denied boarding if you show signs of illness.
* US authorities actively pursue, detain and deport people who are in the country illegally. Be prepared to show documents proving your legal presence.
* Some US states require you to have an International Driving Permit (IDP) in addition to your Australian driver’s licence. Get your IDP before you leave Australia. Road rules vary between localities and states. Learn local traffic rules and driving conditions before you drive.
