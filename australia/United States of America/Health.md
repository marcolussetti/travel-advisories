#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

There is no reciprocal health care agreement in place between Australia and the United States. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including pre-existing conditions and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care. A visit to a doctor for even a minor issue can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, and you may be asked to show proof of insurance or your ability to pay before receiving treatment.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away
* that your insurance covers any pre-existing medical conditions.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate-General](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries.

If you plan to bring medication with you, check whether it's legal in the United States. Take enough legal medication to last the duration of your trip. 

Some medications may be considered illegal or controlled substances, even if available over the counter or by prescription in Australia. It's also illegal to possess any prescription medication in the United States without a prescription.

If possible, keep your medication in its original container and carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect and Tick-borne diseases

Various [insect-borne illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/about-mosquito-bites.html) can occur throughout the United States, including West Nile virus and viral encephalitis (multiple types).

Sporadic outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya virus and zika have also occurred in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands).

Research your destination and get local advice before you travel.

To protect yourself:

* ensure that your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

[Tick-borne ailments](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/index.html) such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Ehrlichiosis and Powassan virus are also present.

Check for ticks after being outdoors, especially in tall grasses and wooded areas.

#### Other health risks

Further information about health risks in the United States, including communicable diseases and preventative measures, is available from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/).

#### Medical care

While the standard of hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States is similar to Australia, medical costs are significantly higher.

A visit to a doctor for even a minor issue can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and you may be asked to show proof of insurance or your ability to pay before receiving treatment.

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave Australia and make sure that it covers you for the duration of your trip, for all activities you intend to undertake, for any pre-existing medical conditions and for all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation.

The Australian Government won’t cover these costs and there's no reciprocal health care agreement between Australia and the United States. This means that you aren’t covered by Australian Medicare in the United States.
