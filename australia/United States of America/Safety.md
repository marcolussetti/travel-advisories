#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Avoid areas where demonstrations and protests are occurring due to the ongoing potential for unrest and violence.

* Monitor the media for information and updates.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities and abide by any movement restrictions or curfews.
* Participating in a protest or demonstration (including online) can be considered a breach of status and grounds for deportation or denial of a visa and/or immigration requests.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Guns, gun violence and violent crime are more prevalent in the United States than in Australia.

Mass shootings, active shooter events and hate crimes occur, including violent incidents directed towards the LGBTQIA+ community and individuals and groups from diverse cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious backgrounds.

Familiarise yourself with how to respond by reading the US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) [Active Shooter Event guide](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/active-shooter-pocket-card).

We don't update our advice for individual gun crimes, such as mass shootings or active shooter events unless Australians face a significant risk.

According to the latest official crime statistics from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/crimestats), violent crime rates vary across the country but are highest in cities and urban areas.

Even in cities with relatively low violent crime rates, there can be unsafe and no-go areas.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* research your destination(s) before travelling and seek local advice on areas that may be unsafe
* monitor the media for new and emerging safety risks
* stay vigilant and take particular care when moving through unfamiliar and/or potentially unsafe areas, particularly at night

If you're affected by violent crime, follow advice from local authorities. If you require consular assistance, contact your nearest Australian embassy or consulate (see Local contacts).

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty crime

Tourists are often targeted for [pickpocketing and purse-snatching](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344). This can happen anywhere but is more prevalent in crowded areas and on public transport.

Conceal your valuables. Pay close attention to your personal belongings and only carry what you need. Leave other valuables in a secure location.

Rental cars can be easy to spot and are often a target of thieves. Don't leave valuables on display or unattended in a vehicle, including in the boot.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains the [National Terrorism Advisory System](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system), a public alert system to communicate information about current and potential terrorist threats in the United States.

Threats include those posed by individuals and small groups motivated by a range of ideological beliefs or personal grievances, as well as those inspired by other recent attacks.

Attacks can be indiscriminate, including at public events, on public transport, schools and in other places where crowds gather.

On 5 June 2025, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued an [alert](https://x.com/FBI/status/1931003576295313886) highlighting potential public safety concerns related to ongoing threats to the Jewish and Israeli communities. 

Subscribe to [National Terrorism Advisory System](https://www.dhs.gov/national-terrorism-advisory-system) for updates and advice.

To reduce your risk of being involved in a terrorist incident:

* be alert to possible threats in public places and near known potential targets
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Before travelling, familiarise yourself with the risks of natural disasters and severe weather events at your destination(s).

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS)](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts and notifications about major disasters.

#### Preparedness

In the event of a natural disaster, our ability to provide consular assistance may be limited.

Prepare yourself by:

* securing your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* subscribing to emergency alert systems and monitoring local media and other sources for developments, important updates and additional pertinent information
* following the advice of local authorities

[Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/) and the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies.html) also provide information on preparing for natural disasters, severe weather events and other emergencies.

Anticipate disruptions before, during and after a natural disaster(s).

* Flights into and out of affected areas may be diverted, delayed or cancelled
* Other forms of travel may be impacted
* Adequate shelter might not be available
* Essential services such as water, electricity, internet and mobile phone services may be disrupted.

Keep in contact with family and friends and let them know you're safe.

The American Red Cross may be able to assist in locating family members in certain circumstances. Information is available on the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/contact-and-locate-loved-ones.html) website.

You can also mark yourself ‘safe’ on social media during and following disasters using the American Red Cross [Emergency! app](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/mobile-apps.html) for mobile devices.

#### Severe weather

[Severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather) can occur year-round in the United States.

Monitor the [US National Weather Service (NWS)](https://www.weather.gov/) for forecasts, updates and severe weather alerts and warnings.

#### Hurricanes

[Hurricanes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather#cyclones) are powerful tropical storms that routinely impact the east coast, Gulf Coast, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

While hurricanes have been known to form in every month of the year, peak activity occurs from May to November.

If you travel during hurricane season, check weather reports and closely monitor the [NWS National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) website.

The direction and strength of hurricanes can change with little warning. Hurricanes can also reach hundreds of miles inland, causing dangerous conditions, widespread damage and disruption to essential services in areas far from the coast.

If a hurricane or tropical storm is approaching, prepare early by following the advice for natural disasters above.

#### Tornadoes

[Tornadoes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather#tornadoes) can occur in all 50 US states but are most frequent and attain the highest intensities across the Central Plains and parts of the Midwest.

They're also common in the rain bands of hurricanes and tropical storms.

Tornadoes can strike with little warning and cause catastrophic damage, with wind speeds sometimes up to 500km per hour (300 mph).

While tornadoes can form at any time of year, they are more common in the warmer months between March to September.

If you're living in or travelling through an area prone to tornadoes, familiarise yourself with warning signals and emergency procedures and monitor the [NWS Storm Prediction Center's](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/) website.

#### After a disaster

Travelling to areas affected by natural disasters and severe weather events can be dangerous.

If you plan to travel to a region after a natural disaster, check with your transport operator that services are operating.

Contact the place you intend to stay and check other sources for details on local conditions.
