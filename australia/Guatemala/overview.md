## Overview

### Safety

* Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Leave affected areas as soon as it's safe to (see 'Civil unrest and political tension').
* Violent crime, including murder, carjacking and kidnapping, is common. Risks increase at night. Take extra care after dark. Only use ATMs during daylight.
* Border crossings have a high crime rate. Only cross during daylight hours. Allow enough time to reach a major city before dark.
* Criminals target travellers at the airport and driving to hotels. Use only pre-paid or radio taxis. Don't use taxis on the street or use taxi stands. Always keep vehicle windows and doors locked, even when moving.
* Guatemala has 4 active volcanoes. Know where your nearest shelter is. Know how to protect yourself in the event of an eruption. If you climb a volcano, use experienced guides and follow local advice.

* Malaria occurs year-round. Consider taking anti-malarial medication if you're travelling to these areas. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue, Chagas disease, river blindness and leishmaniasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* HIV/AIDS is a significant risk. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Medical facilities in Guatemala City are adequate. They're limited elsewhere. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
