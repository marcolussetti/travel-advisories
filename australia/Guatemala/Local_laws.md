# Local laws

#### Local law

Respect local laws and regulations at all times. Follow directions from local authorities.

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include lengthy prison sentences in local jails.

Photographing some government buildings, military sites and areas like the Presidential Palace and airports is illegal. Check with local authorities before taking photos.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Avoid public displays of affection.

Same-sex relationships are legal in Guatemala, but the country is conservative.

Guatemalan males, including dual nationals, must complete compulsory military service.

If you're a male dual citizen aged between 18 and 50 years, contact the [Embassy of Guatemala](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/81) in Canberra before you travel.

If you are an Australian citizen, and a Guatemalan citizen, the consular services we can provide to you may be limited.
