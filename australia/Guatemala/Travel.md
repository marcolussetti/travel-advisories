#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need to purchase a tourist card at the airport. This permits you to visit Guatemala for up to 90 days.

Guatemala is a member country of the Central American Border Control Agreement (CA-4), along with:

* [El Salvador](/destinations/americas/el-salvador "El Salvador")
* [Honduras](/destinations/americas/honduras "Honduras")
* [Nicaragua](/destinations/americas/nicaragua "Nicaragua")

With a CA-4 tourist visa, you can travel freely by land between member countries within the 90-day period.

Your tourist card is dated from the first entry into any member country.

You can apply to extend the CA-4 visa before it expires at the local immigration office.

If you overstay the visa without an extension, you may be:

* fined
* forced to leave
* unable to enter other CA-4 member countries

If you're not a tourist or you plan to stay longer, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the [Embassy of Guatemala](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/81) in Canberra for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

To enter the country, you'll need:

* a valid passport
* a return or onward ticket
* evidence you have enough money for your visit

You'll need to pay an airport and security tax in cash on departure at the airport.

You'll also need to pay an exit tax if your ticket price doesn't include it.

Follow the entry requirements set out by [Guatemalan authorities](http://igm.gob.gt/informacion-extranjeria/) (in Spanish).

#### Other formalities

#### Travel via the United States

If you're [travelling through the US](/destinations/americas/united-states-america "United States of America"), ensure you meet all current US entry or transit requirements, including if you're transiting through Hawaii.

#### Travel via Canada

If you're travelling via [Canada](/destinations/americas/canada "Canada"), ensure you meet all entry and transit requirements.

#### Travel via Chile

If you’re travelling via [Chile](/destinations/americas/chile "Chile"), ensure you meet all current entry or transit requirements.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

Depending on where you’ve travelled, you may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Guatemala. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Travelling with Children

A child travelling to Guatemala without both parents must have [notarised written consent](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/notarial-services) from both parents. A child travelling with at least 1 parent won't need this letter.

These documents must be in Spanish and approved by the Guatemalan mission closest to the child's home.

* [Advice for people travelling with children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children")

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Guatemala Quetzal (GTQ).

You can't import or export the Quetzal. You can only exchange US dollars in Guatemala.

ATMs aren't always reliable. Credit cards are widely accepted.

Contact your bank to make sure your cards will work.

Using ATMs on the street puts you at high risk of [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") or express kidnapping.

#### Local travel

#### Tour operators

Transport and adventure tour operators may not meet Australian safety standards for:

* scuba diving equipment
* providing life jackets, seat belts and other safety equipment

Rescue services may not be as effective as those in Australia.

If taking part in adventure activities:

* check your travel insurance covers you for the activity
* check the operator's safety equipment before you book
* use reputable operators
* use life jackets and seat belts, even if others don't

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Border crossings

Strict security controls are in place at Guatemalan borders due to high levels of drug-related criminal activity.

Military personnel are stationed along the border between Guatemala and Mexico. They may want to check your documents.

Only use recognised border crossings, particularly between Guatemala and Belize. There is an ongoing border dispute between the two countries.

The Mexican government has recently increased security at border crossings into Mexico in response to a large number of migrants seeking to travel to the US. Take extra care when using these border crossings and follow the direction of authorities.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Guatemala, you need both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence

You must get the IDP before arriving in Guatemala.

#### Road travel

Demonstrations are having a significant impact on road transport networks and affecting road travel throughout the country. Monitor the media for updates. (see 'Civil unrest and political tension').

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Guatemala than in Australia.

Driving in Guatemala can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* aggressive local drivers
* poorly maintained vehicles
* roads in poor condition
* drivers ignoring traffic laws

In rural areas, extra road travel risks include:

* poor lighting and street signs
* people and animals on roads

Mudslides and road collapses caused by heavy rains are common. Roads may be closed at short notice.

Inter-city travel after dark anywhere in Guatemala is dangerous. Violent carjackings occur, particularly on poorly maintained roads and main highways.

Dangerous roads include:

* the Pan-American Highway (CA-1)
* the Pacific Coast Highway (CA-2)
* the Atlantic Highway (CA-9)

Criminals have violently attacked motorists between El Salvador and Guatemala, particularly on the Guatemalan side of the border.

* the northern and western Departments of San Marcos
* Huehuetenango
* El Quiche
* Alta Verapaz
* El Peten
* Escuintla

Other dangerous areas for road travel include:

* the route between Cocales (Suchitepequez) and San Lucas Toliman (Atitlan)
* the isolated dirt roads near Lake Atitlan

An alternative route to the Godinez bypass is the main Pan-American highway to Solola.

Criminals sometimes pose as police officers.

It's illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Authorities may arrest or detain you.

If you plan to drive in Guatemala:

* check your travel insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* don't travel alone, at night or through dangerous areas
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Your policy may not cover you for accidents that occur while using these vehicles.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Travelling by taxi can be dangerous.

Book airport taxis and regular taxis through a reputable taxi company. These are safer than taxis flagged from the street or at taxi stands.

If you use a taxi:

* arrange transport through your hotel or a radio dispatcher to avoid unlicensed operators
* buy vouchers from the airport Tourist Office for airport taxis
* book in advance if travelling at night
* don’t let your driver pick up other passengers
* never share a taxi with a stranger
* agree on the fare before you set off
* note your taxi driver’s name and licence number

#### Public transport

Public buses and chicken buses (converted school buses) are often unsafe. Armed robberies are common.

Bus travel can be dangerous. Gangs have targeted, robbed and sexually assaulted passengers on:

* tour buses
* inter-city buses
* luxury coaches

Gangs have also detonated bombs targeting buses. In 2016, gangs killed 5 people in a bomb blast on an inter-city bus in San Jose Pinula, near Guatemala City.

Dangerous areas for bus attacks include:

* border crossings
* tourist areas like Panajachel and Antigua
* the roads from the El Salvador border to Cuilapa
* from the Belize border to El Cruce

If you need to use public transport:

* avoid travelling on public buses or chicken buses (converted school buses)
* only travel on tour buses and inter-city buses with good security arrangements
* do not stow your bag in the overhead bin or under your seat
* check security arrangements before you book

If you plan to travel by bus from Guatemala to southern Mexico, see our [travel advice for Mexico](/destinations/americas/mexico "Mexico").

#### Boat travel

Criminals may attack you on motorised or sailing boats in Rio Dulce and Livingston.

Check there are good security measures in place before booking any [boat travel](/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel "Travelling by boat").

#### Beaches

Strong currents and tides on Guatemala's Pacific coast are dangerous for swimmers.

You often won't find beach patrols, lifeguards or warning and advisory signs.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Guatemala's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TG) with the Aviation Safety Network.
