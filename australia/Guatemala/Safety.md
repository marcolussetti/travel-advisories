# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, particularly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. You’re at risk.   
Take extra care of your valuables in:

* Airports
* Bus terminals
* Public transport
* Tourist areas

To prevent petty crime:

* Be alert after dark
* Avoid being on the streets alone
* Pay attention in crowded areas
* Use ATMs in daylight hours
* Withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks or shopping centres.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is common in Guatemala, particularly in tourist destinations. This includes:

* murder
* [carjacking](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")
* [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)

Crime often involves guns. The risk of violent crime increases at night.

Areas at risk for violent crime, assault and robbery include:

* Guatemala City,
* volcanoes and other tourist sites
* borders with El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico
* land border crossings, where travellers exchange large amounts of cash

Border areas between Guatemala and Chiapas State in Mexico are affected by organised crime and drug-related violence. Risks are higher from the Pacific Coast in San Marcos Department up to the Gracias a Dios border crossing in Huehuetenago Department.

Express kidnappings happen. These are where criminals force you to withdraw funds from ATMs. This can occur at petrol stations and shopping centres.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. If criminals have guns or weapons, they may injure or kill you.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* always be aware of your surroundings
* take extra care after dark
* only use ATMs during daylight hours
* only change money in hotels or banks
* get updates on regional security conditions

Be careful when crossing land borders. Only cross the border during daylight hours. Allow enough time to arrive in a major town before dark.

#### Other crime

Criminals may target you when arriving at international airports or travelling to hotels in Guatemala City and Antigua.

Using an unofficial taxi increases your risk of robbery and assault. Safe options include:

* buying prepaid taxi vouchers from the Tourist Office at the airport
* using radio-dispatched taxis
* using taxis from hotels

Don't use taxis hailed from the street or taxi stands.

You can use an escort from the state-run tourist service PROATUR to reduce your travel risk.

Theft happens at budget hotels, particularly in Antigua.

#### Road-based crime

To protect yourself while travelling by road:

* plan to arrive at La Aurora Airport (Guatemala City) during the day or early evening
* be aware of your surroundings
* travel in a group
* choose a reputable tour company
* never hitchhike or accept rides from strangers

To protect yourself if you're driving:

* keep doors locked and windows up, even when driving
* keep your valuables out of sight

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government’s longstanding policy is that it doesn’t make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Express kidnappings can occur in urban areas, they are often committed by organised gangs or taxi drivers. The kidnappers usually take their victims to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. If threatened, do not resist.

#### Scams and fraud

Scams and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Guatemala. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Volcanoes

Guatemala has 4 active volcanoes:

* Volcan de Fuego
* Pacaya
* Santiaguito
* Tacana

Volcan de Fuego, Pacaya, and Santiaguito volcanoes are very active. Levels of activity may increase at any time. La Aurora International Airport (Guatemala City) can be subject to closures at short notice due to volcanic ash affecting airport operations.

After a volcanic eruption, falling ash can spread over a wide area. Ash, dust and toxic fumes are a significant health risk. If you have a respiratory condition, take particular care.

To protect yourself if there's a volcanic eruption:

* stay inside with the windows and doors shut
* place damp towels under doors and windows if ash is falling
* monitor advice and alerts from authorities

If you go outside, wear a disposable face mask, goggles and long clothing to avoid contact with ash.

To reduce your risks if you climb a volcano:

* only climb with a group
* use experienced guides and a reputable tour company
* follow the advice of local authorities
