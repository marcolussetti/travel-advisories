#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Medications containing pseudoephedrine are banned in Guatemala.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Guatemala. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is, including its generic name
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Other insect-borne diseases occur in Guatemala. These include:

* [dengue](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-dengue-fs.htm)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk in Guatemala.

Take steps to protect yourself if you're at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil drinking water or drink water from a sealed bottle
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* make sure your vaccinations are up to date
* avoid getting water into your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated
* avoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Guatemala City are adequate. Outside the capital, facilities are limited.

Expect to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

Doctors will rarely agree to work with your travel insurer. You may need to be reimbursed after you pay cash for your treatment. Doctors may only speak Spanish.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
