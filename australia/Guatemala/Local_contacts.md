Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia has a consulate in Guatemala City, headed by an Honorary Consul. The consulate provides limited consular assistance to Australians in Guatemala. The Consulate can conduct passport interviews and provide provisional travel documents for emergency travel to the nearest Australian embassy.  The Consulate can’t issue Australian passports. You can get full consular assistance from the Australian Embassy in Mexico City.
