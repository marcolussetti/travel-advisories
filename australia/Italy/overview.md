## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime is common. Be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers at tourist spots and on transport, particularly at central train stations. Thieves often work in groups on trains. Take care of your belongings.
* Bombings against political targets happen. Avoid protests and crowds. Monitor local news.
* Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities, including transport hubs and places visited by travellers. Take official warnings seriously.
* Italy experiences earthquakes and volcanic activity. Large earthquakes cause landslides and avalanches. Forest fires are common from June to September. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
