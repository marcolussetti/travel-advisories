## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime is common. Be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers at tourist spots and on transport, particularly at central train stations. Thieves often work in groups on trains. Take care of your belongings.
* Bombings against political targets happen. Avoid protests and crowds. Monitor local news.
* Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities, including transport hubs and places visited by travellers. Take official warnings seriously.
* Italy experiences earthquakes and volcanic activity. Large earthquakes cause landslides and avalanches. Forest fires are common from June to September. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

* Medical facilities are good in major cities and limited in rural areas.

* Large crowds are gathering in Rome and the Vatican City for the Papal conclave. Remain vigilant of your surroundings, personal belongings and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Italy is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter the country without a visa in some cases.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* The Jubilee, also known as the Holy Year, is taking place in Rome (24 December 2024 to 6 January 2026). A large number of visitors, including pilgrims, visit Rome, and there is a high demand for accommodation. Disruptions to traffic routes, an increased risk of petty crime and limited taxi availability due to overcrowding can be expected. If you're visiting Rome during this time, plan accordingly and make early preparations. For more information, see the [official Jubilee website](https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en.html).
* Temporary border checks have been introduced at Italy's borders with Slovenia. You should allow extra time for crossing the land border between Italy and Slovenia.
* Several cities in Italy impose a 'tourist tax' per person for each night of stay. You pay this directly to your accommodation provider.
