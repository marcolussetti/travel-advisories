#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Italy. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Measles

Italy has experienced outbreaks of [measles](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/measles/en/) (World Health Organization). Make sure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[West Nile virus (WNV)](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) (World Health Organization) cases have been reported. There's no vaccine for it.

To reduce your risk of insect-borne disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in major cities are of good standard. In regional areas, facilities may be limited.

#### Reciprocal Health Care Agreement

There's a [Reciprocal Health Care Agreement](/before-you-go/health/reciprocal-health "Reciprocal health care agreements") between Australia and Italy.

Under this agreement, you can get care in Italian public medical facilities if:

* you have a sudden acute illness or accident
* your illness or accident happens in your first six months in Italy

To access care under this agreement, you must provide your Medicare card and Australian passport.

The Reciprocal Health Care Agreement doesn't replace the need for private travel health insurance.

It also doesn't cover treatment for ongoing health conditions you already had when you arrived.

#### Private medical care

Private doctors, specialists and diagnostic services will ask you to pay up-front.

Private hospitals generally require a large deposit before they will start treatment.
