#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Italy is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries, which means you can enter Italy without a visa in some cases.

If, for unexpected reasons, you can't return to Australia or leave Italy before your visa-free limit expires, contact the nearest [local immigration office ('questura’](https://questure.poliziadistato.it/)) in Italy.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest Italian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/97) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border with Slovenia

Temporary border checks have been introduced at Italy's borders with [Slovenia](/destinations/europe/slovenia "Slovenia"). Allow extra time when crossing the land border between Italy and Slovenia and be ready to show your passport or residency card if you're asked to do so by the border police. Checks may also involve vehicle inspections.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. 

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest Italian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/97) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Italy is the euro (EUR).

You must declare amounts over 10,000 euro or equivalent if you're travelling between Italy and any non-European Union (EU) country, including all forms of currency, not just cash.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

You'll be fined if you don't declare currency or give incorrect information on entry or exit.

ATMs are widely available across the country. Hotels, restaurants and shops accept international credit cards.

#### Local travel

#### The Jubilee

The Jubilee, also known as the Holy Year, will take place in Rome from 24 December 2024 to 6 January 2026. 

A large number of visitors, including Pilgrims, are expected to visit and there's likely to be a high demand for accommodation. Disruptions to traffic routes, an increased risk of petty crime and limited taxi availability due to overcrowding could occur.

During the Jubilee, you should expect an increased presence of security and local authorities may ask you to enter or leave using specific routes.

In Rome, make sure you:

* plan your journey, including accommodation arrangements;
* leave plenty of time to travel, particularly during significant events.

For more information, visit the [official Jubilee website](https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en.html) or download the [official Jubilee App](https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en/applicazione.html).

#### Tourist Tax

Several cities in Italy impose a 'tourist tax' per person for each night of stay. You pay this directly to your accommodation provider, and it's often requested as a cash payment.

You may also need to pay an access fee to visit Venice on a day trip between 18 April – 27 July.

**More information:**

* [Venice access fee](https://cda.ve.it/en/)

#### Driving permit

If you're not a resident, you'll need both:

* an Australian driver's licence
* an International Drivers Permit (IDP) or an official translation of the Australian licence licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

You must get an official translator (traduttore giurato) to translate your licence in Italy. Find a list of official translators in the [Italian Yellow Pages](http://www.paginegialle.it/).

If you take up legal residence (residenza) and stay more than 1 year, you must apply for an Italian licence. Italy doesn't allow you to convert your Australian licence, meaning you'll have to take written and driving exams in Italian. You can do the exam in German or French in some cases.

Contact an [Italian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/97) to find out about obtaining an Italian driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous. Driving conditions are disorganised compared to Australia.

By law, you must use headlights on main roads outside urban areas and highways, including during the day.

On-the-spot fines apply for some minor traffic offences.

Many municipalities have outsourced traffic fine collection to European Municipal Outsourcing (EMO).

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Traffic restricted zones

Limits on car access to the city centres exist to help reduce traffic. They are traffic-restricted zones (ZTL). Be aware that:

* ZTLs and their hours of operation vary from city to city
* fines apply if cars don't carry a ZTL pass in a ZTL zone
* hire cars usually don't have a ZTL pass

If you're staying in the centre of an Italian city, ask your hotel or host about traffic restrictions. You can also check the website of the relevant municipality (comune) before you arrive.

#### Driving in summer and winter

You must use snow tyres or chains in some mountainous regions or areas where snow is common.

Road signs will indicate if they are mandatory.

Authorities may fine you if you don't have the right snow gear for your car.

In summer, only residents can take their cars to the islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida.

#### Travel by foot

Italy has regular pedestrian fatalities. Drivers often fail to give way to pedestrians, even though they have to under Italian law.

Take care when crossing roads, even at pedestrian crossings.

#### Motorcycles

Check whether your insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike, or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only travel in licensed taxis with signage, roof lights and meters.

Unauthorised taxis don't carry meters and overcharge.

#### Public transport

There are frequent strikes that cause delays and cancellations to public transport services (see 'Safety')

Pre-paid tickets are available from tobacconists or coffee shops that display the public transport company's logo/name. They are also sometimes available for purchase through a smartphone app.

You'll find ticket machines at every metro and major train station.

In some cities, you may purchase a ticket using contactless card payment immediately upon boarding a bus.

When catching public transport, validate your ticket:

* before boarding a train or a metro
* on board a bus or tram as soon as you get on

If you don't, you could get an on-the-spot fine.
