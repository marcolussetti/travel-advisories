# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### De facto relationships

Italy doesn't recognise any form of de facto relationship. If a person dies while in Italy, local authorities may not formally recognise their de facto partner as next-of-kin.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include long jail sentences.

#### Conduct at tourist spots

Pay attention to signs about conduct around tourist areas in major cities, including Rome and Florence.

Officials may fine you for littering, sitting, eating or drinking on steps and courtyards around churches and public buildings or in public spaces in these cities.

#### Alcohol laws

Some cities, including Rome, have banned:

* organised pub crawls
* drinking on the street
* drinking in public places

Police have arrested Australians for disturbing the peace under these laws.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to:

* block the pedestrian flow in public spaces
* drive without headlights on main roads outside urban areas or on highways - see [Local travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/italy?#travel)
* buy fake brands and products from illegal street vendors
* litter

If you want to take a photo of an official building or military area, check with local authorities first.

The owner will ask you for a photo ID if you use an internet cafe. The law requires them to sight and keep an electronic record of their clients' photo ID.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
