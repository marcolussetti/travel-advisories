# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, particularly in the summer and autumn tourist seasons. It includes bag snatching, pick-pocketing, passport theft and theft from cars.

Thieves are most active:

* in larger cities
* in and around major tourist spots
* on public transport
* at major airports
* at railway stations and bus terminals
* at beaches (including cars parked near beaches)
* at hotel reception areas

To reduce the risk of theft:

* take care of your belongings
* remain alert in tourist spots
* avoid walking in quiet and poorly lit streets, especially at night

Monitor local sources for advice about new safety or security risks.

#### Theft on trains

Theft is common on trains, including to and from Fiumicino airport near Rome and on overnight journeys.

Thieves often work in groups to distract victims and rob them while they're not looking.

On trains, they do this by:

* asking for directions while a train is stopped at a station
* dropping attractive items on the floor of the train
* blocking the view of overhead luggage racks
* throwing rubbish or sauce at the victim

Often, a member of the group will pretend to come to help the victim while others steal their valuables.

Check the Italian Public Security System site [Polizia Di Stato](http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/view/22329/) for advice on how to avoid theft on trains.

#### Fraud and fake money

Credit card and ATM fraud happens, often involving 'skimming' machines. Monitor your bank statements.

To protect yourself from fraud:

* use ATMs in secure places, such as banks, shops and shopping centres
* keep your ATM and credit cards in sight

Police have warned that counterfeit European currency is in circulation. Check any notes you receive.

#### Spiking, robbery and assault

Tourists have been [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") after consuming spiked food or drinks. This has happened in cities and towns, including Rome, Milan, Florence and Naples.

Some victims have been [sexually assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") or needed hospitalisation.

In Rome, many incidents have taken place:

* around Termini station
* in tourist areas, such as the Colosseum
* in bars and restaurants in the city centre

In Milan, such attacks happen in bars, nightclubs and other late-night venues.

In Florence and Naples, these attacks happen mainly near train stations and in bars and cafes in the city centres.

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* never accept drinks from strangers
* don't leave food or drinks unattended
* stick with people you trust in bars and nightclubs

#### Theft from cars

Vehicle break-in and theft is common. Many Australians have had belongings, including passports and other valuables, stolen from their parked cars.

Thieves steal from cars at traffic lights, rest stops, service stations and on the roadside.

Lock your car doors and keep luggage and valuables out of sight.

There are reports of thieves slashing tyres or staging roadside emergencies. They aim to persuade drivers to pull over and get out of their cars. While the driver is distracted, the thieves steal personal belongings.

Popular targets for thieves are unattended campervans or mobile homes either:

* parked at camping sites
* in the streets near historic sites

To reduce your risk of theft from your vehicle:

* don't leave valuables in your vehicle
* when you leave your vehicle, lock all doors
* try to use a secure parking facility, especially overnight

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Commenting on local or political events on social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, including commenting on laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards.

#### Protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent and spark violent unrest, demonstrations and riots.

To protect yourself from violence and unrest:

* avoid crowds and protests if you can
* monitor local media for possible unrest
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes

Italy is in an active seismic region and has several [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") each year.

Large earthquakes can cause landslides and avalanches. This can result in injuries, death and damage to infrastructure, homes and property.

When travelling in Italy, find out your hotel's earthquake procedure.

If there's been seismic activity in the area you're in or going to, check with your airline or travel provider about disruptions.
