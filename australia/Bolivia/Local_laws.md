# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long prison sentences in local jails.

You must always carry photo identification in Bolivia. This can be a photocopy of your passport and the Bolivian entry stamp pages.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to remove national treasures, including:

* pre-Columbian artefacts
* certain historical paintings
* items of Spanish colonial architecture and history
* some native textiles
* certain flora, fauna and fossils

It's illegal to excavate or collect fossils without written approval.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
