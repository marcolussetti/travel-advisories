## Overview

### Safety

* Political and civil tensions are ongoing, and events can be unpredictable. Large-scale political demonstrations, protests and events can occur with little warning. This may result in travel disruptions and can be violent. Avoid demonstrations and protests.
* Civil unrest is common in Bolivia. Roadblocks, demonstrations, protests (some violent), and strikes could occur at any time. Don't cross roadblocks set up by protesters. Avoid crowds as they can become violent.
* Violent crime, associated with drug trafficking, poses a risk in some parts of the country, particularly Chapare region. Take extra care in these areas.
* Petty theft is common in tourist areas, buses and bus stations. Be alert to attempts to distract your attention from your luggage. Violent crime against foreigners occurs, including armed robbery, assault, and food and drink spiking. Don't leave your food or drink unattended.
* Criminals can pose as taxi drivers. Use only well-known radio taxi companies with the phone number displayed on the vehicle's roof. Don't hail taxis off the streets.

* Many parts of Bolivia are at high altitudes. You can suffer altitude sickness. If you plan to travel to these areas, consult your doctor before you leave. Get travel insurance to cover emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs.
