# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise exercise a high degree of caution in Bolivia due to the threat of violent crime and the risk of civil unrest. Political and civil tensions are ongoing, and events can be unpredictable. Large-scale political demonstrations, protests and events can occur with little warning, which may also result in travel disruptions. Protest activity will likely increase in the lead-up to the 17 August election. Avoid demonstrations and protests. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities (see 'Safety').   
  
While not compulsory, you may be asked to show proof of your yellow fever vaccination at some ports of entry in Bolivia. Some airlines may want to see it when you leave (see 'Travel').

* Civil unrest is common in Bolivia. Roadblocks, demonstrations, protests (some violent), and strikes could occur at any time. Don't cross roadblocks set up by protesters. Avoid crowds as they can become violent.
