#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Bolivia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is a risk in Bolivia. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel. You may be asked to show proof of your vaccination at some ports of entry in Bolivia.  

[Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) is widespread in Bolivia. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends you:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

Travellers are at risk from:

* [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)
* [dengue](http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/disease/en/)
* [Chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [oropouche virus](https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html)

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consult your doctor about how to prevent malaria.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Altitude sickness

You're at risk of altitude sickness if you travel to high altitudes.

Altitude sickness can be life-threatening and affect anyone, even if you're healthy.

You're more at risk if you:

* ascend quickly
* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before you get used to the altitude
* have health problems that affect breathing

Many areas of Bolivia are at high altitudes, including:

* La Paz
* Salar de Uyuni
* Lake Titicaca
* Potosi
* Sucre

See your doctor for specific advice to minimise the risk of altitude sickness.

Check if your insurance covers emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs.

#### Medical care

Private hospital facilities in Bolivia's major cities are reasonable. Outside of major cities, facilities are limited.

Treatment at private clinics and hospitals is expensive.

Hospitals often need payment or proof of medical insurance before they will treat you, even in an emergency.

You could need treatment at a more suitable place if you become seriously ill or injured.

Medical evacuation from Bolivia can be difficult and very expensive. Many air ambulance services can't fly into La Paz due to the high altitude.
