#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

You don’t need a visa to visit Bolivia for tourism. The length of stay permitted upon entry is 30 days. You can request an extension of your stay at an immigration office in Bolivia. The maximum visa-free stay length is 90 days during one calendar year.

Ensure you get an entry stamp when you arrive in Bolivia. Otherwise, you'll have to pay a fine when you leave. You should also make sure to get an exit stamp, especially when you are crossing a land border.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/28) for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you must meet US entry or transit requirements.

#### Accommodation registration

If you have not completed the electronic registration prior to arriving in Bolivia, immigration inspectors at the port of entry may register you and give you further instructions. If you don't register, you can receive a fine when you depart from the country. Consult your accommodation provider for more information.

#### Passport

#### Passport

You need to have at least 6 months validity remaining in your passport to enter Bolivia.

Emergency travel documents can be used to enter, transit, or depart Bolivia, as long as it has at least 6 months validity when entering Bolivia.

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/node/44).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country.

Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
