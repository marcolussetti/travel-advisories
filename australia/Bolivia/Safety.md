# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protest activity will likely increase in the lead-up to the 17 August election. Political and civil tensions are ongoing, and events can be unpredictable. Large-scale political demonstrations, protests and events can occur with little warning. This may result in travel disruptions and can be violent. Authorities may use tear gas and force to control protests. Strikes and demonstrations may disrupt local and international travel.

#### Roadblocks

Roadblocks are common. They can disrupt public transport at very short notice and strand travellers. Take extra food, water, medication, warm clothing and cash with you. Don't cross roadblocks set up by protesters, even if they appear unattended. Doing so may lead to violence. Check the [Bolivian road authority](http://transitabilidad.abc.gob.bo/mapa) website (Spanish only) for up-to-date information on which roads are blocked. 

#### Drug-related crime

Anti-narcotics activities can lead to conflict between authorities and their targets. Bystanders and tourists can be affected. Violent crime and civil unrest mainly associated with drug trafficking is a risk in:

* the Yungas region in La Paz department
* border areas, and
* Chapare region

Chapare region is in Cochabamba department. Criminal groups and gangs linked to illegal drug trafficking operate in this region. Local authorities have used force in past confrontations over coca eradication. Authorities may be very limited or unable to provide help in this area. 

During periods of unrest:

* pay close attention to your personal security at all times
* avoid demonstrations, protests and large public gatherings
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

Criminals sometimes pose as police officers. Under Bolivian law, police need a warrant with your name on it, to detain or search you. If a police officer approaches you, ask to see their warrant.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime against foreigners, including [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) and [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault), occurs.

Violent crime can happen, including in the cities of La Paz and Santa Cruz, particularly:

* in tourist areas
* on public transport

Assaults and robberies are becoming more common, especially:

* in shared, unmarked and radio taxis
* in Coronilla Hill, located behind the main bus terminal in Cochabamba
* among hikers travelling without a guide on the Inca trails and in Rurrenabaque

Use an experienced, reputable tour guide to reduce risks when hiking.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Petty crime

Theft is common:

* in tourist areas, including the Uyuni salt flats
* on buses
* in bus stations

Thieves work in teams using various forms of distraction. Remain alert to your surroundings and ensure that your belongings, including your passport, are secure at all times. 

#### Ayahuasca tourism

Ayahuasca involves shamans guiding visitors through psychedelic rituals, often referred to as 'spiritual cleansing'. Ayahuasca is not illegal, but some participants have been assaulted, including sexual assault, and robbed. Several tourists have died after consuming the hallucinogenic substances in these rituals.

If you decide to take part in ayahuasca tourism:

* research potential ayahuasca tour operators before signing up
* avoid participating in ayahuasca rituals without a trusted friend present

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Express Kidnapping

Express [kidnappings](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") are a high risk. Victims are forced to withdraw money from ATMs to secure their release.

Use only well-known radio taxi companies with the phone number displayed on the vehicle's roof or ride-sharing applications. Don't hail taxis off the street. Note the taxi's registration number and phone number.

Travellers in Bolivia can also be victims of food and drink spiking, followed by robbery or assault.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't leave food or drinks unattended
* don't accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers or people you have just met
* use experienced, reputable tour guides for hiking or adventure trips
* take extra precautions in the land border regions

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Bolivia experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including [landslides](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#landslides), [flooding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#floods) and [bushfires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#bushfires).

The rainy season is from November to March. Landslides and flooding are common. Severe flooding and landslides can:

* disrupt transport services
* close airports
* make road travel difficult

If you plan to travel in the rainy season, confirm arrangements before you leave and check local weather reports.

Bushfires are common during the dry season, from July to October. Heavy smoke may degrade air quality, including in La Paz. It is advisable to wear a face mask or to stay inside if the air quality is poor.

In case of a [natural disaster](/node/346):

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with friends and family

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow recommended safety precautions or maintenance standards. They may not provide safety equipment, such as life jackets and seat belts.

This includes adventure activities, such as "Death Road" mountain biking tours, tours to the Uyuni salt plains, and mine tours in Potosi.

If you plan to take part in a tour, or [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
