# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences, such as possession, use or trafficking are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

#### Smoking

Smoking, including vaping, has been banned in all public places, including beaches, parks, hotels and restaurants. You may be fined or arrested.

#### Surrogacy

If you're considering entering into a surrogacy agreement in Mexico, be aware that laws and regulations vary by state. While surrogacy is legal in some parts of Mexico, other areas have restrictions or outright bans, especially for foreign nationals. There is no legal framework to protect parents who pursue surrogacy in Mexico. 

Before proceeding:

* consult a legal expert familiar with Mexican surrogacy laws.
* research prospective agencies and clinics to ensure that you're dealing with a reputable organisation.
* ensure you understand the legal requirements and the potential challenges for citizenship and parental rights.
* be prepared for possible delays in obtaining necessary documentation for your child, such as birth certificates, Australian citizenship and/or travel documents.
* be prepared for the possibility of significant medical expenses.

Spanish is the official language in Mexico, and you may need to engage the services of a translator for several different scenarios, including engaging with your lawyer and medical provider. 

The Australian Embassy can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics or agencies

You may need to spend a significant amount of time in Mexico before and after the birth, to complete processes, such as issuing a birth certificate.

Don’t confirm travel plans until you’ve finalised citizenship and passport processes. If unforeseen legal complications arise, this period could be considerably prolonged.

#### Property laws

Property laws and time-share agreements can be complex.

Before you buy or invest in property, do your research and get legal advice.

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Public displays of affection may attract negative attention.

Same-sex relationships are legal in Mexico, but the country is conservative.

Same-sex marriages are recognised in Mexico.

#### Other laws

In Mexico, it's illegal to:

* conduct political activity, including demonstrations
* possess ancient Mexican artefacts or export them from Mexico
* carry firearms or ammunition without a permit, including in Mexican waters
* drive a car without insurance
* fail to report a road accident.

If you need a firearm permit, apply at a Mexican Embassy or Consulate before you arrive.

You're responsible for any illegal items found in rented or borrowed vehicles. This applies even if you don't know they're there.

If you're the victim of a crime and want to report the incident, do so immediately to the nearest branch of the state prosecutor’s office (Agencia del Ministerio Público). A criminal investigation is not possible without a formal complaint to Mexican authorities. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Mexico recognises dual nationality. If you are an Australian citizen, and also a Mexican citizen, the consular services we can provide to you may be limited.
