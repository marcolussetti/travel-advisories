#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mexico. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in Mexico, particularly in:

* the State of Chiapas
* rural areas of Nayarit, Oaxaca and Sinaloa
* some parts of Chihuahua, Durango and Sonora.

[Zika virus](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/zika-virus) is widespread in Mexico. There's no vaccination for Zika virus.

Read the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care page on [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) for advice on how to reduce your risk.

If you're pregnant, the department recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas.

In Mexico, there's also a risk of:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [chagas disease](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis))
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider medication to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk in Mexico.

Protect yourself if you are at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

High altitude and air pollution can cause health issues in some regions. Pollution peaks in winter from December to February.

If you have heart, lung or respiratory problems, ask your doctor for advice before you travel.

Foodborne, waterborne and other diseases are widespread. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [cyclosporiasis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/index.html)

Serious outbreaks occur from time to time. 

Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* make sure your vaccinations are up to date
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals
* avoid getting water into your eyes, mouth, or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated
* avoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Air pollution

Severe air pollution happens in Mexico during the dry season.

This can lead to respiratory problems. Before you travel, discuss the risks and how to manage them with your doctor.

#### Medical care

Private hospitals in Mexico City and other major cities provide a reasonable standard of care. Services are limited in rural areas.

Treatment at private clinics and hospitals is very expensive. You will likely need to pay up front and claim back later from your insurer.

Doctors may only speak Spanish.

If you are seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with appropriate facilities. Medical evacuation can be expensive. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.

You can find hyperbaric chambers in major cities and resort towns where scuba diving is popular.
