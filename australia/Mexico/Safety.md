# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common, mainly pickpocketing and bag-snatching. You’re most at risk in big cities in Mexico.

Take extra care of your valuables in:

* airports
* bus terminals
* public transport

To prevent petty crime:

* be alert after dark
* avoid being on the streets alone
* pay attention in crowded areas
* use ATMs in daylight hours
* withdraw or change money in secure areas like hotels, banks, or shopping centres.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is widespread in Mexico. This includes:

* murder
* [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [burglary](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* carjacking
* [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")

Criminals posing as police officers have committed sexual assault, extortion and robbery. They may drive fake police cars.

Watch out for drink and food spiking, which can occur in bars, clubs and restaurants. You're at higher risk of sexual assault and theft if you get drugged. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fsafety%2Fpartying%23methanol&data=05%7C02%7CLauren.Clayton%40dfat.gov.au%7C00f6d6c1d09a45955fbd08dd1e1fc99a%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638699844080650961%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=8yTmaAQEo83CC6beHTob%2FtKUbSPJI1tooGvKn5N6%2FXo%3D&reserved=0).

Gangs have attacked travellers after they've changed money at airports.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid travelling at night outside major cities, including on major highways
* monitor the media for new safety risks
* don't change large amounts of money at the airport

Crime on intercity buses and highways is common in Mexico.

Violent carjackings have increased. The northern borders and along the Pacific coast are high-risk areas.

Criminals have attacked tourists on toll roads and highways. The Sonora, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas and border regions are high-risk areas.

Plan your travel carefully. Some cities should only be accessed directly by air travel or major toll roads wherever possible. Other travel options and routes may have higher security risks.

Organised crime groups have targeted large campervans and SUVs travelling in and out of the United States.

To reduce the risk of crime when travelling by road:

* use ride-share services where possible instead of taxis
* use official taxis from airports and pre-pay your fare at an official taxi company booth in the airport terminal
* use radio taxis or taxis at assigned stands (sitios), especially in Mexico City
* use first-class buses
* only travel during daylight hours and allow enough time to get to your destination before dark
* drive via toll roads (cuota)

Watch out for drink and food spiking, which can occur in bars, clubs and restaurants. You're at higher risk of sexual assault and theft if you get drugged.

#### Drug and gang violence

Violent crimes related to the drug trade are widespread in Mexico.

Shoot-outs, grenade attacks and car bombings have occurred in public places.

Targeted attacks have increased on the military, government officials and journalists.

You may become a victim of violence directed against someone else.

Federal police and the military use roadblocks and random vehicle checks to deal with drug-related violence.

Drug cartels set up unofficial roadblocks in the northern areas of Mexico to obstruct military and police movement.

Stop at all roadblocks, or you risk getting killed. Comply with the instructions given.

Risks are higher in those areas most affected by drug-related and gang violence, including:

* Northern border states – Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas
* Pacific coast states – Colima, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit and Sinaloa
* Central region states – Guanajuato, Durango, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas
* Border with Guatemala, in particular Chiapas.

#### Other violent areas

Violent crimes occur in many popular tourist areas, including Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Tijuana and Puerto Vallarta. To reduce your risks if travelling to violent areas, stay in:

* tourist areas
* well-known and well-frequented public areas with good access to safe transport in the evenings

To protect yourself from crime in violent areas:

* avoid road travel, especially at night
* avoid isolated locations
* pay close attention to your personal security
* stay alert to possible threats around you
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media for safety or security risks

#### Other crime risks

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

**More information:**

* [Cyber security when travelling overseas](/before-you-go/staying-safe/cyber-security "Cyber security when travelling overseas")

#### Scams and fraud

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") and credit card fraud are a risk.

Instances of credit card and ATM fraud can occur. Take precautions when using debit or credit cards.

Scam artists target foreign visitors and residents. The scams come in many forms and can cause great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Mexico. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.

#### Women Travellers

Women traveling alone may encounter instances of sexual harassment and verbal abuse.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is a serious risk in Mexico. Kidnapping occurs throughout the country, with the highest number of cases recorded in and around Mexico City, along the Gulf Coast from Tamaulipas to Tabasco states, and in other large cities. Kidnappers target a broad demographic, including wealthy Mexicans, migrants seeking to cross the US borders as well as foreigners and expatriates. Motives are also varied, with political kidnappings and forced disappearance reported across the country. Victims of traditional kidnappings are physically abducted and held captive until a ransom is paid. In some cases, the captors receive a ransom and kill the victim.

Some victims claim police officers or other officials are involved in their kidnapping.

Virtual or scam kidnappings target people over the phone to extort money. Kidnappers pose as officials or cartel members and demand payments for the release of a family member they have allegedly detained. If you receive a call or message, contact local police. Criminal groups may also attempt to extort relatives of tourists reported as missing in news reports.

Express kidnappings are also regularly reported in Mexico. Kidnappers force victims to withdraw funds from ATMs before being released, including being held in an unauthorised taxi.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and protests against the government can occur. Some can turn violent, causing injuries and deaths. They may occur anywhere across the country and often affect public transport.

It's illegal for foreigners to take part in political demonstrations in Mexico.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests, and public gatherings
* check the media for reports of unrest
* follow advice from local authorities

Protesters may blockade roads.

Public protests in Mexico City are common. Expect protests and potential roadblocks in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoacán and main entrances to Mexico City.

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest")

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Swimming safety

Even strong swimmers can be at risk from undertows and currents on both coasts of Mexico. Follow the beach warning flags.

Rescue services may not consistently meet international standards, and unpredictable tidal changes can result in powerful currents and common riptides. Lifeguards and warning flags may not be present on all beaches to signal hazardous conditions.

#### Diving

Tour operators and diving centres may not adhere strictly to international standards. When engaging in adventure sports such as diving, choose a reputable company with proper insurance coverage.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Mexico can experience natural disasters and severe weather, such as: 

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [hurricanes](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident")
* [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [landslides](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#landslides)
* [mudslides](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#landslides)

To protect yourself if a natural disaster is approaching:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow advice from local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

The hurricane and rainy season is from June to November. Landslides, mudslides, and flooding can happen.

If you’re travelling during the rainy season, contact your:

* tour operator to check if services are affected
* airline for flight updates

Tropical storms and hurricanes can happen in other months. Hurricanes can change direction and strength suddenly.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or cancelled
* flights out may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available
* electricity supply, communication networks and transport options may be disrupted.

Severe weather may also affect:

* listen to the instructions of local authorities
* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* identify your local shelter
* monitor advice from authorities

Check the [US National Hurricane and Tropical Prediction Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php) for weather forecasts.

#### Earthquakes

Mexico experiences earthquakes and tremors each year. Aftershocks are common and can damage already weakened structures.

Earthquakes can disrupt power and communication systems.

Get to know the earthquake safety measures for each place you stay and visit.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis may occur in Mexico.

Receive tsunami alerts by registering with the following:

* [Global Disaster Alert and Co-ordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/)
* [Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre](https://tsunami.gov/)

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, check local media.

#### Volcanoes

Active volcanoes include the Popocatepetl and Colima volcanoes.

Volcanic ash from eruptions of these volcanoes can disrupt domestic and international flights and cause airport closures. Exposure to falling ash and toxic fumes from active volcanoes can also affect your health, especially if you suffer from respiratory ailments.

* avoid the affected areas
* monitor local media to remain informed
* contact your travel agent or airline regarding airport and flight status
* be prepared to change your travel arrangements or evacuate the area on short notice
* follow the advice of local authorities, including evacuation orders
