## Overview

### Safety

* Mexico has a high risk of violent crime, including murder, armed robbery, sexual assault, and kidnapping. Carjackers and armed robbers may target people travelling at traffic lights. Don't travel at night outside major cities. Drug-related violence is widespread.
* Plan your travel carefully. Don't travel at night outside major cities. Use major toll roads wherever possible or access cities directly by air travel. Other travel options and routes may have higher security risks.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Kidnapping and extortion are serious risks. Don't draw attention to your money or business affairs.
* Stop at all roadblocks, or you risk getting killed.
* Avoid protests and large public gatherings. These can become violent. It's against the law for foreigners to participate in political activity.
* Petty crime, including robbery at ATMs, is common. Only use ATMs in secure areas, such as hotels, banks and shopping centres during daytime.
* The hurricane season is June to November. Hurricanes can cause landslides, mudslides, and flooding. Know where your nearest shelter is. Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Malaria and Zika virus are risks in Mexico. If you're pregnant, ask your doctor about the risk of Zika virus before you travel.
* Mexico has insect-borne diseases, including dengue fever, chikungunya, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Parts of Mexico are at high altitudes. Air pollution can also cause health issues, particularly over winter (December to February). Talk to your doctor before you travel if you have heart, lung or breathing issues.

### Local laws

* Smoking, including vaping, is banned in all public places in Mexico, including beaches, parks, hotels and restaurants. Importing electronic cigarettes and vaping devices is also prohibited. You may be fined or arrested.
* Some activities are illegal for foreigners in Mexico. These include political activity, driving without insurance, and failing to report a road accident. Ensure you understand and follow local laws.
* Possessing or exporting ancient Mexican artefacts and carrying firearms or ammunition without a permit are also illegal. Apply for a firearm permit at a Mexican embassy or consulate before you arrive.
* Although same-sex marriage is legal in Mexico, some parts of the country are conservative. LGBTQIA+ travellers should consider limiting public displays of affection.
* If you plan to take part in commercial or altruistic surrogacy arrangements in Mexico, be aware of all legal and other risks involved. Get comprehensive and independent legal advice from a Mexican lawyer with specialisation in this area of law. For further details see the ‘Surrogacy’ section in the full advice.
