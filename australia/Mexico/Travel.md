#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If you have an ordinary passport with a chip, you can use the e-gates at the airports of Mexico City (AICM), San Jose del Cabo and Cancun.

This authorises Australian citizens to stay for 180 days exclusively for tourism purposes. You'll receive a receipt and have 60 days to download your e-tourist card.

The requirements to use e-gates are:

* have a valid ordinary passport with a chip
* be of legal age (18+)
* enter the country exclusively for tourism purposes, not valid for business, students, or other purposes
* not traveling with minors

The e-gates aren't able to be used if you have a valid visa and/or immigration document issued by the Mexican Government, such as:

* permanent resident visa/card
* temporary resident visa/card
* student resident visa/card
* work visa/card
* visitor visa/card for humanitarian reasons
* visitor visa/card for adoption purposes.

If you don't have an ordinary passport with a chip and you visit for 180 days or less as a tourist, you can get a visa on arrival. Be aware of the date that's stamped in your passport on arrival, as you may not receive the full 180 days. Your visa will expire on a date given by the immigration officer. This is usually for the amount of time you indicate to the immigration officer that you are staying in Mexico. This 180-day period isn't guaranteed, and the decision is up to the immigration authorities’ discretion.

To avoid being detained or deported, you'll need to:

* fill in an online Multiple Immigration Form (FMM) and obtain a QR code
* make sure your passport is stamped by immigration officials on arrival

You can complete the FMM online before you arrive or on arrival.

If you're entering by road, make sure you get the stamp on your passport at the immigration office [(Instituto Nacional de Migración: Spanish)](https://www.gob.mx/inm). These are usually located near, but not directly at, a border crossing.

Present your completed FMM for inspection at immigration if entering by air. You'll need to show it when you leave Mexico.

#### Border measures

To cross the land border between Mexico and the US, you'll need to verbally provide the reason for your travel.

If you are entering Mexico from the United States, and no immigration officer is available to stamp your passport, locate the nearest immigration office before proceeding. These offices are typically close to the border, and customs officials can guide you. It’s usually more difficult to resolve immigration issues after leaving the border area.

Confirm your travel and transit arrangements directly with your airline or travel agent.

[If the value of the goods](https://anam.gob.mx/pago-de-contribuciones-por-excedente-de-franquicia-de-pasajeros/) exceeds the permitted amounts, you will have to pay a tax.

#### Travel via the United States or Canada

If you're [travelling through the US](/destinations/americas/united-states-america "United States of America"), ensure you meet all current US entry or transit requirements, including if you're transiting through Hawaii.

If you travel[through Canada](/destinations/americas/canada "Canada"), ensure you meet all entry and transit requirements.

#### Other formalities

Mexico charges all visitors an immigration fee.

If you arrive on a commercial flight, the cost of your ticket includes the fee.

If you enter by land, the immigration office will arrange for you to pay the fee at a nearby bank. There's no exit tax.

A child under 18 years who's also a citizen or resident of Mexico must carry a [Mexican Minor Travel Consent Form](https://www.inm.gob.mx/menores/publico/solicitud.html) (Spanish) or a [notarised consent](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/notarial-services) if travelling with anyone other than their parent or legal guardian.

You may need a permit if you arrive in Mexico by motor vehicle. Check with the Embassy of Mexico before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This may apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Mexico's official currency is the Mexican Peso (MXN).

Declare amounts over US$10,000 or foreign currency equivalent. Do this on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

US dollars are widely accepted in holiday resort areas. You can't generally exchange Australian currency and traveller's cheques in Mexico.

ATMs are widely available in cities and towns. Take care as credit card fraud occurs.

Carry cash if you're travelling to rural areas.

Most international hotels and tourist facilities accept credit and debit cards.

Ask your bank whether your ATM card will work in Mexico.

#### Local travel

Plan your travel carefully. Some cities should only be accessed directly by air travel or major toll roads wherever possible. Other travel options and routes may have higher security risks.

Our consular partners (Canada, United Kingdom and United States) also publish travel advisories for Mexico that you can read.

#### Driving permit

You can use your valid Australian driver's licence to drive in Mexico.

#### Road travel

Vehicles generally don't stop for pedestrians or indicate when they're turning. Intersections can be confusing, with vehicles coming from unexpected directions.

Strict laws cover insurance and reporting of accidents.

If you drive in Mexico:

* learn local road use and driving rules
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* only travel during daylight hours and allow enough time to get to your destination before dark
* use toll roads (cuota) to reduce the risk of crime

If you're a victim of roadside robbery or stopped at a roadblock, do as you're asked.

Driving on rural roads in Mexico is dangerous due to:

* poor road conditions.
* pedestrians and livestock on roads
* inadequate street lighting and signage

Criminals target vehicles, including campervans and SUVs, especially in rural areas.

#### Taxis

Use ride-share services, where possible, instead of taxis. If this isn't an option, it's best to use registered official taxis and limousines, preferably arranged through your hotel. To avoid issues:

* use official taxis from airports
* pre-pay your fare at an official taxi company booth at the airport
* use official taxis or taxis waiting at assigned stands (sitios), especially in Mexico City

#### Public transport

Crime levels on intercity buses and highways are high, and the risks increase after dark. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/mexico#safety)

Use first-class buses.

Women travelling on public transport should be cautious.

#### Air travel
