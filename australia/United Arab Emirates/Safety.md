# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning. Conflicts in the Middle East or Gulf region could affect the UAE.

There's an increased threat of terrorism in the UAE, including threats against military bases. Maintain a high level of security awareness.

Rebel groups in Yemen have previously targeted the UAE and neighbouring countries with uncrewed aerial systems, including drones and missiles, most recently in January 2022.

Further attacks are possible.

Be alert and monitor local and international media. In the event of a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations in the UAE are rare and must be authorised by the government. Wearing clothing reminiscent of a political cause may be seen as a form of protest. Australians have been detained for wearing the Palestinian Keffiyeh (head scarf) and rainbow colours.

To protect yourself in case of unrest:

* avoid all rallies and protests
* monitor the media for news of possible demonstrations or protests
* be prepared to change your travel plans

#### Terrorism

There's an increased threat of terrorism in the UAE, including threats against military bases. Maintain a high level of security awareness.

Authorities have in the past arrested several alleged terrorists for possibly planning attacks in the UAE.

Several terrorist attacks have happened in the wider Gulf region in recent years.

Attacks could occur at any time and could target:

* places of worship
* military sites
* hotels
* transport hubs
* shopping malls and markets
* major events
* residential compounds
* tourist locations
* other locations visited by foreigners

#### Crime

The UAE has a low crime rate.

Cybercrime and online financial scams are common in the UAE. Criminals can target devices to steal personal and credit card data if you're connected to public/shared Wi-Fi.

Pickpocketing and bag snatching occurs but is rare.

Incidents of drink spiking are reported.

Physical and verbal harassment and sexual assaults occur. Avoid walking alone after dark in isolated places, including pedestrian underpasses.

#### Sexual assault

If you're a victim of sexual assault, find out about support services as quickly as possible from the:

* [Australian Embassy and Consulate-General in the UAE](http://uae.embassy.gov.au/abud/home.html)
* Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra

Consular officers can't provide legal or medical advice. However, they can provide lists of English-speaking service providers who may be able to help.

UAE law places a high burden of proof on the victim. Victims of sexual assault will need to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual, especially when the victim had consumed alcohol or where the alleged attacker was known to the victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Cybercrime and online financial scams are common in the UAE. Criminals can target devices to steal personal and credit card data if you're connected to public/shared Wi-Fi. Common Scams include:

* Money transfers
* Work permits/job offers
* Gold purchase
* Romance/Online dating

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Sandstorms and dust storms often happen.

The [NCEMA Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NCEMAUAE/) and [NCEMA website](https://www.ncema.gov.ae/) will be updated during a crisis.
