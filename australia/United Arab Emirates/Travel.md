#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian passport holders are eligible for tourist visa on arrival.

Diplomatic and official passport holders must obtain a visa before travelling.

For visa information, visit the [UAE Federal E-Government Portal](https://u.ae/en#/) or the [Emirates](https://www.emirates.com/au/english/help/covid-19/dubai-travel-requirements/?) or [Etihad Airlines](https://www.etihad.com/en-ae/fly-etihad/visas) website before booking your flight.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your nearest [UAE Embassy or Consulate-General](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad) or the local authorities to confirm your visa and/or residency status and for details about entry permits, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Criminal activity

If you have unresolved criminal charges, including unpaid debts in the UAE, authorities may detain you when you arrive. Immigration officials may then transfer you to police custody. This can be the case even if you only plan to transit through the airport.

Immigration authorities can refuse you entry if you have a criminal record. It won't matter how long ago the offence took place.

If you're worried about authorities denying you entry, contact an [UAE embassy or Consulate-General](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/209) before you leave Australia.

You may also inquire about your legal status through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department's online enquiry service or the Government of Dubai Public Prosecutor's online enquiry service.

Your UAE Unified Identity Number can be retrieved through the online Unified Number Enquiry Service.

#### Restricted items

It's illegal to import:

* poppy seeds
* pornographic material

Importing pork products requires special approvals.

Authorities may examine and censor or confiscate videos, books and magazines.

It's illegal to carry weapons or replica weapons, including used bullet cartridges, into the UAE.

#### Passport

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Emergency passports are not accepted for entry to the UAE.

If your Australian passport has 'XX' anywhere in your date of birth, for example, 'XX FEB 1980', you will be refused entry to the UAE. Your passport must have a numerical date of birth, for example, '14 FEB 1980'.

Australian passports which have only one name will be refused entry to the UAE.You must have a name in the both the first and last name fields to enter the UAE.

If you're travelling on an Australian passport showing 'X' or (non-binary, indeterminate, intersex, or unspecified) in the sex field, you won't be able to enter or transit through the UAE. You can only enter or transit through the UAE if you carry a passport that shows the sex specified as ‘F’ (female) or ‘M’ (male).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If you're a UAE resident and lose your Australian passport while overseas, contact your nearest UAE embassy. They can give advice on re-entering. Do this before applying for an emergency passport.

If you lose your passport before passing through UAE immigration, you must return to Australia on the next available flight.

Once you're in Australia, you can apply for a full passport. The Australian Embassy can't issue you a new passport if you haven't cleared UAE immigration.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

Foreigners must provide their passports for scanning when checking in to a hotel.

If UAE law enforcement take your passport for any reason, make sure they give you a receipt. You'll need the receipt to collect it later and when checking into accommodation.

#### Money

The local currency is the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED).

Currency exchange outlets and ATMs are readily available throughout the UAE. Credit cards are widely accepted.

You must declare cash above AED100,000 or the equivalent in other currencies. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

If you're on a tourist visa and want to drive, you must get an International Driving Permit before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in the UAE than in Australia.

Accidents often occur due to:

* speeding
* tailgating
* drivers crossing lanes
* reckless overtaking

When driving, be aware of other dangers, including:

* roaming animals
* pedestrians and cyclists
* fog
* drifting sand
* dust storms

Pedestrian deaths and serious injuries on the road are common in the UAE. Only cross the road at marked crossings. However, still take extra care. Vehicles won't always give way.

Off-road driving can be dangerous. Ensure vehicles are well equipped and properly maintained.

If you're driving in desert areas, travel with at least one other vehicle. Use a GPS and take enough petrol and water.

Land border crossing points may close without notice. If you plan to leave the UAE by road, check the border crossing is open before you depart.
