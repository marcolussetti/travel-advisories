# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Behaviour that could be considered offensive or antisocial, but not criminal, in Australia could violate UAE law. Anyone breaking UAE laws, even without knowing, may face severe punishments.

UAE law applies to you even if you're only transiting and don't leave the airport.

The UAE is a mostly Muslim country. Local laws closely reflect Islamic practices and beliefs.

Sharia or Islamic courts work alongside the civil and criminal courts in the UAE. This can make legal issues and systems complicated.

Even simple legal issues can be complex and take time to be resolved. Custodial sentences are served in local jails.

If you have unresolved criminal charges in the UAE, including unpaid debts, authorities may detain you on arrival, even if you're in transit.

You can enquire about your legal status through the [Abu Dhabi Judicial Department](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/home.aspx)online enquiry service or through the Government of Dubai Public Prosecutor online enquiry service.

Your UAE Unified Identity Number can be retrieved through the online [Unified Number Enquiry Service](https://gdrfad.gov.ae/en/unified-number-inquiry-service).

#### Legal process

If you come to the attention of UAE authorities, your case will be dealt with by the local legal and judicial system. This differs significantly from Australia's legal system.

If you're arrested, authorities may hold you for a long time before your case goes to trial. UAE authorities can hold your passport and stop you from leaving the country. Even simple legal issues can take a long time to resolve. Custodial sentences are served in local jails.

If you're going to be deported, you'll be in immigration detention for at least 24 hours before being allowed to leave the UAE.

#### Laws in individual emirates

The UAE is made up of 7 emirates, each with its own justice system. Laws, legal procedures and penalties vary between systems.

There's a federal court system with a final court of appeal in Abu Dhabi. This is called the Federal Supreme Court. Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah aren't part of this system.

#### Commercial, civil and family law disputes

Australians are often involved in disputes where local firms or courts have taken their passport. This prevents them from leaving the UAE until the dispute is settled.

You can be jailed or stopped from leaving the UAE for offences including:

* having a cheque dishonoured
* not paying bills, including court fines, hotel bills, personal loans and local credit cards

Immigration authorities can refuse you entry if you have a criminal record. It won't matter how long ago the offence took place.

If you travel to the UAE with an active case against you, including an unpaid UAE debt, authorities are likely to detain you on arrival. This applies even if you're only in transit and don't plan to leave the airport. Speak to a lawyer before you travel if you think you might have an unsettled case against you.

Bail is generally not available to non-residents arrested for fraud. You can be jailed until debts are settled.

If you take part in activities involving local legal matters, get professional legal advice. This is particularly relevant for family law matters including:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support

Ask a legal professional about your rights and responsibilities.

If you have children or assets in the UAE, get local legal advice about preparing a local will or registering a foreign will. Information is also available through the [Abu Dhabi Judicial Department Foreign Communities Awareness](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/EN/Pages/ForeignCommunitiesAwareness.aspx).

#### Drugs

The UAE has a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs, including for travellers transiting through the country.

Penalties for drug trafficking may include the death penalty, or a sentence up to life imprisonment.

Penalties for having or using illegal drugs include lengthy jail terms and heavy fines. These laws also apply if you're transiting through the UAE.

If illegal drugs are found in blood or urine tests, this is considered possession. It won't matter where or how long ago you consumed the drugs.

You can be charged with possession if trace amounts of drugs are found on your body, clothing or luggage. You can be convicted for 0.05g or less.

Avoid carrying substances that could be mistaken for drugs or drug equipment. This can include, for example, marijuana-flavoured or branded:

* liquor
* tea
* chewing gum
* lollies

Lab testing on suspicious substances could take days or weeks. During this time, authorities could detain you without bail.

#### Media activity

You must obtain permission in advance from the Emirati authorities to undertake media activity relating to the production, transmission or distribution of printed, digital, audio, video or visual information. If you fail to do this, you could be arrested and deported from the UAE.

Taking photographs of people, particularly women, without permission can lead to arrest or fines.  This also applies to people you've just met.

Posting photos of people or their personal belongings on social media without their consent can be illegal. This includes people in the background of photos.

#### Public displays of affection

You can be arrested for intimate public displays of affection, including kissing. This behaviour can attract the attention of local authorities. See Local customs below.

#### Unauthorised preaching

If you engage in unauthorised preaching or distribute non-Islamic religious material to Muslims, you can be jailed and deported.

If you make offensive comments about Islam either in writing or verbally, you could be jailed or subject to other penalties.

#### Social media and behaviour online

The UAE has strict laws about online behaviour, including comments.

Online behaviour that may be considered a crime includes:

* spreading rumours or gossip
* defamation of an individual or business
* swearing and insulting others

* [Advice for volunteers](/before-you-go/activities/volunteering "Going overseas to volunteer")

#### Sex outside of marriage

Heterosexual sex and cohabitation outside of marriage for individuals over 18 years old have been decriminalised in all Emirates except for Sharjah.

Extra-marital sexual relationships (adultery) is illegal in the UAE. If either person's spouse or parent/guardian files a criminal complaint, then both parties of an extra-marital consensual relationship shall be liable to a jail sentence.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are illegal and may lead to severe punishment, including prison and fines.

Cross-dressing is also illegal.

If you're transgender or intersex, or your gender on your passport doesn't match your appearance, you may:

* be questioned at immigration
* be denied entry into the UAE

If you're travelling on an Australian passport showing 'X' or 'U' (indeterminate, intersex or unspecified) in the gender field, you won't be able to enter the UAE.

**More information:**

* [Advice for LGBTQIA+ travellers](/before-you-go/who-you-are/LGBTQIA "Advice for LGBTQIA+ travellers")

#### Prostitution

Prostitution is illegal in the UAE.

Severe penalties apply to:

* people providing prostitution services
* customers of prostitution services

#### Registering births of children born to unmarried parents

If you're unmarried and fall pregnant or give birth in the UAE and wish to obtain a local birth certificate, both you and your partner will need to either get married or you and/or your partner must singly or jointly acknowledge the child and provide documentation in accordance with the laws of your country.

#### Alcohol

Although a Federal law has decriminalised the use of alcohol, every Emirate has its own guidelines.

The Emirate of Sharjah is 'dry' which means the sale or consumption of alcohol is illegal. You can't carry alcohol in your car if you're:

* driving through Sharjah
* crossing the border from Oman into Sharjah

There are limits on how much duty-free alcohol you can bring in. These limits are strictly enforced.

#### Liquor licences

Although a Federal law has recently decriminalised the use of alcohol, every Emirate has its own guidelines.

Liquor licences are still required for Residents in Dubai but are no longer required for Residents in Abu Dhabi and other Emirates (except for Sharjah) to purchase alcohol for personal consumption.

A liquor licence is only valid in the Emirate that issues it. For example, a liquor licence issued in Ras Al Khaimah isn't valid in Dubai.

#### Legal drinking age

The legal drinking age in Abu Dhabi is 18 years. However, a Ministry of Tourism by-law means hotels can only serve alcohol to people aged over 21 years.

The legal drinking age in Dubai and the northern Emirates, except for Sharjah, is 21 years.

#### Drinking in public

It's illegal to be intoxicated in public outside of licenced venues. You can be arrested. Authorities have arrested travellers at the airport for becoming intoxicated on a flight or while in transit.

Be careful if you're using a taxi when intoxicated. If you have a dispute with a driver or vomit in a taxi, you may be:

* taken directly to a police station
* charged with public intoxication

If you commit a crime after drinking alcohol, you'll probably be charged with both that offence and with intoxication.

Penalties for alcohol-related offences include fines, jail or deportation.

#### Employment

You must have a valid work permit from the [UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx) for any type of employment.

If you plan to work, sort out terms and conditions or sponsorship before starting. This will minimise the risk of a dispute.

If you get into a dispute, a special department of the UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation can review and help settle your claim.

Your UAE employer may ask to hold your passport as a condition of employment. This is illegal, but not unusual.

An employer can hold your passport for a short time when arranging, renewing or cancelling your visa or work permit. If your passport is held for a longer period, either:

* make a complaint to the [UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
* get legal advice

If you’ve been a resident in the UAE, make sure you cancel your work visa before leaving the country permanently. If you don't, it may seem like you're running away. In this case, you could be arrested if you return to or even transit through the UAE.

You have to take a full medical exam to get a work or residence permit. This includes an HIV/AIDS test. HIV certificates issued by foreign medical authorities aren't accepted.

#### Other legal issues

#### Photography and other hobbies

It's illegal to photograph:

* people without permission
* airports and related transport infrastructure
* bridges
* government buildings, including embassies
* palaces

Taking part in some hobbies, particularly around these sites, can break the law. These include:

Register drones with the Civil Aviation Authority of the relevant Emirate before you use them.

#### Driving laws

It's illegal for residents to drive without a UAE driver's licence once they have residency. Non-residents and travellers must have an International Driving Permit (IDP).

Although common in the UAE, it's illegal to use a mobile phone, eat or drink while driving.

Other illegal activities include:

* jaywalking
* walking on highways
* hitchhiking

It's illegal to drive after drinking alcohol. You may be jailed or fined if you have any alcohol in your blood when driving. These laws are strictly enforced in the UAE.

Police must be called to all road accidents, including single vehicle accidents. It's illegal to leave the scene of a traffic accident.

If you have an accident, don't take photos of the other car without the driver's permission.

### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The UAE doesn't recognise dual nationality.

Children born in the UAE to Emirati fathers automatically become UAE citizens. They must enter and leave the UAE on UAE passports.

We can't provide consular help if you enter the UAE on a non-Australian passport.

Sharia law may be applied in child custody disputes. Speak to a lawyer about custody disputes and find out if your children could be prevented from leaving the country.

#### Local customs

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in the UAE. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public or in front of people who are fasting. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Explore our [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### Dress and behaviour

The UAE is a mostly Muslim country with strict standards of dress and behaviour. Take care not to offend.

Get familiar with local customs, culture and attitudes before leaving Australia.

Research dress codes for tourist attractions, shopping malls, beaches and other public places. These are often displayed onsite or available on websites.

Dress modestly, especially in Sharjah and Ajman where Islamic law is strictly enforced.

If you're a woman, cover your shoulders and knees.

Get local advice if in doubt about appropriate dress.
