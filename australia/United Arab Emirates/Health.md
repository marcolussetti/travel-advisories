#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you travel.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

There are laws about bringing in certain medications into the UAE. If you arrive with certain medication, you may not be allowed into the country or may be prosecuted. Get pre-approval and the required documents before you arrive.

You can only bring a 3-month supply of medication, whether entering or transiting the UAE.

Authorities have detained or deported travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis

Before you leave Australia:

* some medications require a permit, you can apply for a permit through the UAE Ministry of Health website
* contact the UAE Ministry of Health if the link to their website is not functioning in your country or if you require more information, by e-mailing [info@moh.gov.ae](mailto:info@moh.gov.ae) or calling +971 800 11111. You may also contact the UAE embassy in the country you are in.

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases sometimes occur. Get medical advice if you develop a fever or diarrhoea.

Dust storms and sandstorms can make breathing issues worse.

Red tide algal blooms sometimes affect beaches. This can cause:

* skin irritations
* eye irritations
* breathing problems

Don't swim in affected water. Check with local authorities about outbreaks.

If there's a red tide alert, follow local warnings. This algal bloom can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Avoid shellfish and seafood because they may be affected.
