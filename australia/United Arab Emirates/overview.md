## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.
* There's an increased threat of terrorism in the UAE, including threats against military bases. Maintain a high level of security awareness. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local officials.
* Demonstrations and protests are prohibited and rarely occur, unless they have been authorised in advance by local authorities. Avoid any demonstrations or protests if you come across them.
* The crime rate is low. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, occurs but is rare. Drink spiking sometimes happens. Physical and verbal harassment and sexual assaults occur. Avoid walking alone after dark in isolated places, including pedestrian underpasses.
* Be prepared for extreme weather. Between June and September, temperatures can exceed 50°C. Sand and dust storms are also common. In extreme heat, stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water. Intense storms can occur between December and May, which may trigger flash flooding. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Many areas of the Gulf are sensitive to security issues and territorial disputes. There's also a risk of piracy. If you're planning sea travel, refer to the International Maritime Bureau’s piracy reports.

### Health

* There's a heightened risk of contracting communicable diseases like cholera, typhoid and hepatitis A following heavy rains and flooding which occurred in April. Avoid contact with stagnant water and use bottled water to brush your teeth.
* Cases of dengue have been reported. Protect yourself from mosquito bites.
* Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported. Avoid contact with camels and products contaminated with camel secretions.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases sometimes occur. Get medical advice if you develop a fever or diarrhoea.
* Red algae or 'red tide' may sometimes affect beaches. This can cause skin and eye irritations, as well as breathing problems. Don't swim in affected water.
* The standard of public medical facilities in major cities is adequate. However, services might not be available in remote areas. You may have to pay upfront before treatment.
