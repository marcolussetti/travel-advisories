# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

There's no Embassy or Consulate of Australia in Yemen. Our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in Yemen is extremely limited, including if you're arrested or jailed.

Get professional legal advice if you're involved in local legal matters. This includes criminal, business or family law, divorce, child custody and child support.

Buying or removing Yemeni antiquities is illegal without a permit from the relevant local authorities.

In Yemen, both men and women should dress modestly in public.

Be aware of your rights and responsibilities.

#### Marriage

If you wish to [marry](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/marriage) a Yemeni national, your partner will first need approval from the Government of Yemen.

Preaching or promoting a religion other than Islam in public, except in churches, is illegal. Attempting to convert Muslims is illegal.

Consequences could be severe and could result in assaults or death by such groups or other local religious organisations or individuals.

Restrictions apply to the sale or possession of alcohol, pornography and pork. Customs authorities at border entry points will confiscate these products.

In some cases, authorities have detained travellers at borders because of the smell of alcohol on their breath.
