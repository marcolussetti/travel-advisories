#### Security situation

Do not travel to Yemen, including the island of Socotra due to the ongoing civil and international conflict. There's extreme political and security instability.

Despite truce agreements, the security situation in Yemen remains highly unstable and unpredictable.  Truce agreements may be violated or terminated at any moment, which may escalate the security situation and levels of violence.

Military operations are taking place in Houthi controlled areas in response to attacks by Houthi militants on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and attacks on Israel. The Houthis continue to target and attack ships transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waters, including the Gulf of Aden.

On 23 May 2024, the Australian Government listed Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code). Under Division 102 of the Criminal Code, it is an offence to be a member of, associate with members of, participate in, train with, or provide support to, a terrorist organisation. These offences are punishable by up to 25 years imprisonment.

There may be limited government control over parts of the country.

Violent jihadist groups have a strong presence in some parts of Yemen. Terrorist groups in Yemen remain a serious threat and continue to plan and conduct attacks.

Terrorists have staged repeated attacks against Yemeni Government interests and civilian targets. Foreign interests continue to be prime terrorist targets.

Locals and foreigners, including UN staff, aid workers, and employees of non-government organisations (NGOs), have been the targets of arrest, kidnapping, terrorism and assassination.

Tribal fighting over land and other causes is common. Local tribes are heavily armed and may use weapons, including in major cities.

There are landmines in some areas of the country, including Hudaydah city. These have killed civilians.

Some regional countries also have a military presence in Yemen.

Following years of conflict, there's been a breakdown in government and public services, including power and water supplies. It has impacted the supply of goods and services across the country. Medical services and supplies are extremely limited and may not be available in some areas.

Food insecurity and a deteriorating economic situation may worsen due to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Transport options to leave Yemen are very limited, and roads may be closed at any time without notice.

Most people in Yemen do not speak English.

Australia does not have an Embassy or Consulate in Yemen. It may be difficult for the Australian Government and the Embassy in Riyadh to provide emergency consular or passport services. The Embassy of Australia in Riyadh is not able to provide assistance with evacuation or repatriation to Australians in Yemen.

#### Travel disruption

Terrorism and civil unrest have severely disrupted air travel and other means of leaving the country.

Most international flights have been suspended. Limited commercial flights to and from Yemen have operated out of Aden, Seiyun (Hadhramaut) and Sana'a to different destinations in the region. Flights may be disrupted at any time with little notice.

The conflict has damaged airport and sea port infrastructure.

You may not be able to get enough food, water or medical care.

If you're in Yemen despite our advice, you should consider leaving if it's safe to do so.

If you can't leave, take shelter in a safe place. Keep a low profile and explore all available options to leave.

Routes in and out of Yemeni cities and ports may become blocked at short notice. Follow the advice from local authorities or trusted security experts before trying to leave by road.

#### Electricity outages

Electricity supply throughout Yemen is unreliable, and power outages are common. Power outages can last for hours.

Opportunistic criminal acts and mass protests can occur during power outages.

Businesses such as petrol stations that are reliant on government-supplied electricity or without backup electricity generators may temporarily suspend operations during power outages.

#### Consular assistance

There's no Australian Embassy or Consulate in Yemen, and it may be difficult to provide emergency consular or passport services to Australians in Yemen. Our ability to provide consular and passport assistance is extremely limited. In a consular emergency, if you can't contact an embassy, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Australia on +61 2 6261 3305 from overseas or 1300 555 135 from Australia.

If you need to renew your passport while in Yemen, contact the [Embassy of Australia in Riyadh](https://saudiarabia.embassy.gov.au/) to check whether you're eligible for a [mailed-in application](https://saudiarabia.embassy.gov.au/ryad/Passports.html).

Australian officials have been instructed not to travel to Yemen because of security concerns.

If you enter the country or remain despite our advice:

* keep in contact with family and friends
* don't travel alone or at night
* check routes before you travel
* don't put your travel or other plans on social media
* if travelling in a vehicle, lock doors and keep windows closed at all times
* work with only reliable, registered and authorised organisations and travel agencies
* don't carry large amounts of cash or display signs of wealth
* follow instructions from local authorities

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There's a very high threat of kidnapping throughout Yemen, including in urban and rural areas.

Terrorists in Yemen have kidnapped locals and foreigners in recent years, including UN staff, aid workers and journalists. Some foreign hostages have been killed, and some may have been sold to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda in the Arabia Peninsula (AQAP) and Daesh (ISIS).

Terrorist groups, tribal groups and criminal gangs kidnap foreigners, including Australians. Tribal groups and gangs sell victims to terrorist groups.

Kidnappers often ask for large ransom payments to release captives.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.    
   
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Terrorism

#### Terrorist attacks

There's a very high threat of terrorism throughout Yemen.

Terrorist targets include:

* Yemeni Government interests, including infrastructure, seaports and airports, security force bases, government Ministries, and surrounding areas
* security patrols and parades
* Houthi interests
* places of worship
* foreign interests
* tourist attractions, embassies, diplomatic vehicles, international businesses and organisations, and hotels  
  other locations where foreigners might be

Foreign officials, business travellers, tourists and foreign residents have also been targets.

Terrorists can launch attacks in all parts of Yemen. Foreigners have been attacked in urban and regional areas.

Terrorists have attacked oil facilities and kidnapped international aid and oil workers. They may be planning more attacks on oil infrastructure and other organisations, including aid organisations in Yemen.

Attacks and assassinations by car bombs, drones and gunfire have occurred. These can occur anywhere in Yemen. If you decide to remain in Yemen despite our advice, you should:

* get professional security advice and liaise with trusted contacts
* adopt strict security procedures and explore reliable resources to protect yourself
* be aware of your surroundings
* be extremely cautious and keep a low profile at all times
* carefully consider the need for any travel
* monitor local and international media for up-to-date information on the local situation
* consider keeping your next of kin informed by your welfare

All Australians are at risk, regardless of occupation, ethnic or religious background, location or length of stay.

Always be alert. Avoid posting your photos and geographic locations on social media while in Yemen. Vary your routines and make sure patterns in your behaviour and movement aren't obvious to anyone watching.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests can take place at any time and place. Even peaceful events can turn violent without warning.

Protests and demonstrations may affect your ability to travel by road. During demonstrations, roads, highways, and other routes, including to and from the airport, may be blocked. Security checkpoints may be deployed in or around the areas of demonstrations and protests.

Important dates and political anniversaries can motivate violence and civil unrest. Mass protests may occur over power and water outages and can turn violent. Roads may be blocked by local authorities and protesters.

Significant civil unrest occurs around days related to the reunification of North and South Yemen. This includes Unity Day on 22 May.

If you're in Yemen, despite our advice, you should:

* avoid major events because violence could happen
* not go to any demonstrations, protests or political rallies and leave affected areas as soon as it's safe
* stay away from crowds because they can often turn violent

Be careful around Friday prayers, mourning, and religious anniversaries and festivals, and stay indoors.

Carefully monitor local media for safety and security risks, including significant political events that may increase tensions. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Crime

Weapons are readily available in Yemen, and tribes are often heavily armed.

Violent and organised crime is widespread in Yemen. Police response times are poor. Local law enforcement's ability or willingness to respond to serious crimes may be limited or non-existent.

Armed carjacking has occurred in many parts of the country. Drive with your doors locked and windows up at all times.

Pickpocketing, bag snatching, and credit card fraud, such as skimming, may happen. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery, electronic items or other valuables.  
  
Don't display signs of wealth or bring large amounts of cash to Yemen. Exchange currency at official exchange stores only.  
  
To protect yourself against petty theft:

* keep a close eye on your belongings
* leave valuables in a safe place and carry only what you need
* do not post photos on social media of your valuables
* secure your passport and other travel documents

If you're female, take extra care when dealing with strangers or people you've just met. Be especially wary about accepting rides or invitations. Women travelling alone can be harassed and should take care, especially at night.  
  
In Houthi-controlled areas (central and northern Yemen), authorities may seek to detain women participating in community and leadership activities or women travelling without a male guardian.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Piracy

There's a significant threat of piracy and armed robbery in Yemeni waters, the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.

Pirates have attacked vessels and held foreigners hostage for ransom in the Gulf of Aden.

Attractive targets for pirates include:

* commercial vessels
* pleasure craft
* luxury cruise liners

You should remain out of the [designated High-Risk Area](https://on-shore.mschoa.org/reference-documents/advice-for-sailing-vessels/) or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. Check with the [Maritime Security Centre](https://www.mschoa.org) (Horn of Africa).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it does not make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

**More information**

* [Piracy reports](http://www.icc-ccs.org/) issued by the International Maritime Bureau (IMB).

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
