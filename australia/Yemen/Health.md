#### Travel insurance

If despite our advice you plan to travel to Yemen, you will need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian travel insurance policies will not cover you for travel to Yemen, including the Island of Socotra.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including hospital stays and medical evacuation. Be aware that most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept Australian or other health insurance. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs or get involved in any commercial disputes.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave. Explore support resources prior to travel. Search for and consider carrying a list of local doctors and hospitals before your travel.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some medicines may not be available in Yemen, and there may be shortages of other medicines.  
  
Some skincare products and e-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Yemen, such as Cannabidiol (CBD) oil. CBD oil or products are illegal in Yemen, even if they're for medical or recreational purposes. It's a serious crime to carry illegal drugs or CBD oil or products in Yemen. Punishment can result in imprisonment and deportation.

For more information or to check if your medication is legal in Yemen, please contact and check with your nearest Embassy or Consulate of Yemen prior to your departure.

Local authorities may detain or deport travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis - see [Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/united-arab-emirates#health)

Always take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry your medicine in its original packaging and a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor that states:

* your name
* the medicine's brand and scientific (chemical) name
* the prescribed dosage and the duration of treatment, and
* that it's for your personal use.

#### Health risks

#### Respiratory system risks

Cases of [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)) have been reported in Middle Eastern countries, including Yemen.

Countries outside the Middle East have also reported cases from returning travellers.

The altitude in the Sana'a region can cause problems, especially for those who suffer from lung, heart or chest problems.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is common, except in areas above 2000m. Chloroquine-resistant strains have been reported.

Other insect-borne diseases, such as [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis) and [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis) are common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/diseases) are common. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles)
* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [diphtheria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diphtheria)
* [diarrhoea](https://www.emro.who.int/yemen/news/two-years-since-world-largest-outbreak-of-acute-watery-diarrhoea-and-cholera-yemen-witnessing-another-sharp-increase-in-reported-cases-with-number-of-deaths-continuing-to-increase.html)

Severe outbreaks sometimes happen. Ensure all your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.

A major cholera outbreak has intensified since late April 2017. Cholera is spread mainly through contaminated drinking water or food. In addition to cholera, other contagious diseases are circulating in the country.

To stay safe:

* avoid drinking tap water. Drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* don't eat ice cubes
* avoid raw or undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The current conflict has made it difficult to access full medical services across the country.

The standard of medical facilities and services is generally poor and is of an even lower standard in rural areas. Ambulance and emergency services are inadequate and are often not available or accessible, particularly in rural areas.

You must pay upfront if you're treated in private healthcare facilities. Most hospitals accept cash payments only.

You may need to be medically evacuated for serious illness, an accident, or complex procedures. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and difficult to organise. Check your insurance policy and contact your insurance provider for assistance.

The electricity supply throughout Yemen is unreliable, and power outages are very common. Public and private hospitals that don't have backup power generators sometimes temporarily suspend operations during power outages.

If you're in a rural area and become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to main cities or internationally. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Keep local emergency numbers and local contacts with you at all times.
