The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable. If the regional security situation deteriorates again this may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions at short notice (see ‘Safety’).

## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel to Yemen (including the island of Socotra) due to the ongoing civil and international conflict.
* The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable. If the regional security situation deteriorates again this may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions at short notice.
* Australians should read our general advice about [terrorism risks](/node/342) and  protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](/node/622).
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities.
* Military operations continue in Yemen and the Red Sea in response to attacks by Houthi militants on ships transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waters, including the Gulf of Aden.
* Despite truce agreements, the security situation in Yemen remains highly unstable and unpredictable. Airstrikes, other military activities and violent clashes may occur sporadically and without warning. There may be limited government control over parts of the country.
* There's extreme political instability, risk of injury from landmines and unexploded ordinance, and a very high threat of kidnapping and terrorism. You may also be unable to get enough food, water or medical care.
* There's a very high threat of kidnapping and terrorism in urban and rural areas around Yemen, including in the main cities of Sana'a, Aden, Hadhramaut and Ta'izz. If you're in Yemen despite our advice, get professional security advice. Keep a low profile and vary your routines and behaviours. Targets include the Yemeni Government and Houthi interests, foreigners and foreign interests, journalists, international organisations and NGOs. Take extreme care near places that belong to Yemeni authorities.
* Most international airlines no longer fly to Yemen. If you're in Yemen despite our advice, consider leaving if it's safe to. If you can't leave, then shelter in a safe place. Follow the advice of local authorities or trusted security experts before trying to leave by road or other method.
* Australian officials can't currently travel to Yemen to provide consular help. Nearly all countries have suspended embassy operations and withdrawn diplomatic staff. If you enter Yemen or stay despite our advice, work with only reliable, registered and authorised organisations. Don't travel alone or at night.
* Physical, verbal and sexual harassment can occur.
* Important dates and religious or political anniversaries, such as Unity Day on 22 May each year, can cause violence and civil unrest. Avoid public gatherings. Be careful around Friday prayer times.
* Weapons are readily available. Yemenis are often heavily armed. Armed carjacking is common.
* There's a high threat of piracy in Yemeni waters and the Gulf of Aden.

### Health

* Get comprehensive travel insurance before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. You'll probably need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Yemen.
* Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported. Avoid contact with camels and products contaminated with camel secretions.
* The Sana'a region is at a high altitude which may cause issues if you have lung, heart or chest problems.
* The standard of medical facilities is basic. It's difficult to access medical services in the current conflict, and medical facilities or services in Sana'a, Aden, and elsewhere in the country may not be readily available or efficient. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation, which can be very expensive and difficult to arrange.

### Local laws

* Get professional legal advice if you're involved in local legal matters, including family and business law.
* Don't use, carry or traffic illegal drugs. Severe penalties include jail terms and the death sentence.
* Many laws in Yemen are different to those in Australia, including for same-sex relationships, adultery and abandoning the Islamic religion or promoting a religion other than Islam. Punishment may include imprisonment and the death penalty. Drinking alcohol in public, slander, and adultery are all punishable by lashing.
* If you're sexually assaulted, you may face criminal prosecution. Authorities may not consider you to be a victim of crime.
* Be careful when taking photos. Photographing government buildings, military personnel and sites, airports, equipment and other sensitive infrastructure is illegal. These may not be clearly marked.
* Yemen doesn't recognise dual nationality. Dual nationals may need to complete national service.

### Travel

* If, despite our advice you travel to Yemen, including the island of Socotra, you'll require a visa to enter. This can't be issued on arrival. A visa does not guarantee entry to Yemen.
* You may be denied entry to Yemen if your passport has an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by a border office with Israel.
* If you're trying to leave Yemen, check exit requirements with local immigration authorities before you book your ticket.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Yemen for the latest details.
* Land borders, seaports and airports may close with little or no notice. Check with local authorities before travelling to the border.
* The Houthi authorities in northern Yemen have imposed a 'mahram' requirement, which bans women from travelling without a male guardian. In some cases, evidence of a male guardian's written approval may be sufficient.
* A Yemeni husband may legally stop his wife from leaving the country, regardless of her nationality. Children under 18 need their father's permission to leave the country, regardless of who has custody.
* Don't travel by road without expert local advice. You may need permission from local authorities to travel outside Sana'a and some other cities. Unexploded weapons and landmines are a high risk in the central highlands and southern and eastern regions, especially around Aden and Sa'ada province.
* The waters around Yemen have sensitive security issues and territorial disputes. Get advice from authorities before entering Yemeni waters or ports.
* Forced marriage and marriage of girls under the age of 18 is common in Yemen. Sharia (Islamic) courts have jurisdiction over custody cases involving Muslim parents.
