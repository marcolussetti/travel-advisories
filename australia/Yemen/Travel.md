#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

We advise against all travel to Yemen, including the island of Socotra.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Yemen](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/219) for the latest details.

Australians are required to obtain a visa before travelling to Yemen.

Some private tourist companies located outside Yemen may be offering tourist visas and flight packages to the Island of Socotra in Yemen. Ensure that you obtain a visa from the legitimate Yemeni Government. Please contact your [nearest Embassy or Consulate of Yemen](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/219) for details.

If you're trying to leave Yemen, check exit requirements with local immigration authorities before you book your ticket.

Contact your airline and/or travel agent for their schedules and how to purchase tickets.

Flights could be delayed or cancelled at short notice. Check with your airline before travelling to the airport.

All land borders with countries neighbouring Yemen, seaports and airports may close at short or without prior notice. Check with local authorities before travelling to the border. Check our travel advice for [Saudi Arabia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/saudi-arabia) and [Oman](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/oman), which share land borders with Yemen.

Regardless of the purpose and duration of stay, persons with known HIV infection are not allowed to enter Yemen.

Local authorities may detain and deport travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis

You may be denied entry to Yemen if your passport has an Israeli visa, an Israeli border stamp, or an Egyptian or Jordanian border stamp issued by a border office with Israel.

Check with your airline for the latest information on the airline's own boarding requirements.

#### Other formalities

Women can be subject to strict family controls and may be stopped from leaving the country.

In Houthi-controlled areas, a decree has been issued that women, including female aid workers, may only travel if accompanied by a male guardian ('Mahram'). This includes women travelling between Houthi-controlled areas and when travelling outside Yemen via Sana’a International Airport. An exemption may be granted in limited circumstances. These restrictions may also apply in non Houthi-controlled areas.

A Yemeni husband may legally stop his wife from leaving the country, regardless of her nationality.

Children under 18 must have their father's permission to leave the country. It doesn't matter what the status of their parent's marriage is or who has custody.

Single parents or adults travelling alone with children may need documentation. You may need evidence of parental responsibility before you're allowed to leave the country with children.

Forced marriage and the marriage of girls under the age of eighteen is common in Yemen. Australian girls/women, including dual nationals who travel to Yemen, may become victims of forced marriage. Local authorities may not be in a position to provide protection or support to victims of forced marriage or women suffering from domestic violence and abuse.

Sharia (Islamic) courts have jurisdiction over custody cases involving Muslim parents. When custody disputes arise, and a custody case is before the local court, the local court may impose a travel ban on the child/children. In line with the [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter), the Embassy of Australia cannot intervene in court proceedings and private and/or legal matters, including family and custody disputes. Seek advice from a competent local lawyer.

A travel ban can be imposed against individuals even without a court order. In this case, the Embassy of Australia cannot assist, as outlined in the [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Authorities may not let you enter or exit Yemen if:

* you're travelling on an emergency passport
* the name and/or photo in your passport are different from how you present

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by Yemen. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of Yemen](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/219) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Yemeni Rial (YER).

Banking facilities are limited.

ATMs are rare outside Sana'a. It's difficult to exchange Australian dollars in Yemen. US dollars in cash is the most easily convertible currency. Exchange currency at official exchange stores only. You may need to use cash for most transactions in Yemen. Most places, including hotels and hospitals, do not accept payment via bank or credit cards.

Yemen has rules about the amount of currency you can bring in and take out. Currency limits can change. Check details with your [nearest Embassy or Consulate of Yemen](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/219) prior to your travel.

Receiving international transfers in Yemen may be challenging, as some providers have suspended money transfer services to Yemen.

#### Local travel

If you travel to Yemen against our advice, you should regularly assess your security arrangements and carefully plan your movements. Security precautions and arrangements may not remove the security threat in Yemen. Many areas are sensitive from a security or territorial point of view. If you travel against our advice, you should:

* be proactive and remain alert to your surroundings at all times
* not travel alone within and between cities and only use safe and secure transportation
* not draw attention to yourself and keep a low profile
* delete any sensitive photos and comments from your devices, as well as comments on social media that may be seen as against Islam or Palestine, or supportive of Israel, as these may be considered controversial or provocative by local extremist or radical groups.
* secure your belongings, and leave copies of important documents in a safe place or with your family
* carry as little currency as possible and do not display signs of wealth
* know who to call in an emergency
* keep your friends and family updated

You may need permission from local authorities to travel outside Sana'a and some other cities.

Authorities may close access to certain areas without notice.

Petrol and diesel may be limited and unavailable sometimes without prior notice by local authorities.

#### Hiking

Unexploded weapons and munitions, including landmines, are a major hazard. They're found in the central highlands and the western, southern and eastern regions, especially around, but not limited to, Aden, Lahij, Ad Dali, Al Hudaydah, Al Jawf, Ma'rib, Shabwah and Ta'iz and in Sa'ada province.

#### Road travel

Travelling by road in conflict areas or on mountain roads is dangerous. Don't consider it without expert local advice. Public transportation is unsecure and unreliable. Access routes in and out of major cities may be blocked or closed. Roadblocks and checkpoints may be set up without warning. The majority of roads in the country are single carriageway. Driving is on the right-hand side of the road.

Many vehicles are in poor condition and there is a severe shortage of fuel. Driving standards are poor and road traffic rules are often ignored. Pedestrians, especially children, and animals can be a hazard in both rural and urban areas.

Other potential risks may include landmines and unexploded ordnance from previous and ongoing conflicts, including in some rural areas and areas where there is conflict. Landmine locations may not be marked.

Avoid all road travel outside of the main cities alone and at night.

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance covers you
* learn local traffic rules and behaviour, and always wear a seat belt
* always remain alert as drivers may drive on the wrong side of the road, at dangerous speeds, and may not always follow local traffic rules
* know what to do in case of an incident or accident
* follow the speed limits
* do not cross any red traffic lights
* always keep your car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* stay alert, especially when driving at intersections and at night
* remain alert as drivers may drive on the wrong side of the road and don’t follow traffic laws

You’ll need a valid Australian driver's licence and an International Driving Permit to drive in Yemen. Driving under the influence of alcohol is prohibited and carries severe penalties including fines, imprisonment and deportation.

Shared taxis are common in Yemen. Private taxis are also available in major cities and at airports. Negotiate taxi fares in advance. It may not be safe to use local taxis. Seek advice from local authorities and trusted contacts.

#### Boat travel

Do not travel to Yemen, including the island of Socotra, due to the security situation. There is extreme political and security instability.

Military operations are occurring in Yemen and the Red Sea in response to attacks by Houthi militants on ships transiting the Red Sea and surrounding waters, including the Gulf of Aden. If you travel to Yemen despite our advice, seek guidance from authorities before entering Yemeni waters or ports.

Due to the current conflict and tensions in Yemen and the region, ships and boats sailing in or around Yemeni waters could be at high risk of being targeted by missiles, projectile, or waterborne explosive devices.

There are reports of sea mines planted in the southern Red Sea near ports and drifting sea mines near the border with Saudi Arabia.

Keep a safe distance from the FSO Safer supertanker, moored approximately 4.8 nautical miles off Yemen’s Red Sea coast near Hodeidah Port, which is at risk of exploding or sinking.

#### Air safety

The security situation in Yemen remains volatile. There's widespread disruption to air travel and other departure options.

The safety record of airlines in Yemen is not available. There is no data about how well local planes are maintained. This lack of transparency raises concerns about airline safety.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
