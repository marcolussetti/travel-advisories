# Local contacts

#### Emergencies

Emergency services may not be available or reliable.  Don't rely on them.

Check with local authorities for the emergency contact numbers you may need in the city of your stay. Emergency contact operators may not speak English.

Depending on what you need, you should contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline

Always get a police report when you report a crime.

Your insurer should have a 24-hour emergency number.

The phone network is unreliable and very limited outside of cities and large towns. Internet services are available but are poor and do not cover most areas of the country. Internet services are very unreliable on mobile networks and internet connection is generally weak.

Communications and iInternet services may be disrupted at any moment and without prior notice.

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Yemen, therefore the Australian government and Embassy in Riyadh are unable to provide emergency services to Australians in Yemen.

The ability of the Australian Government to provide consular help to Australians in Yemen is extremely limited.

In a consular emergency, if you can't contact the Embassy of Australia in Riyadh, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Australia on +61 2 6261 3305 from overseas or 1300 555 135 from Australia.
