#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Burkina Faso, be aware that borders may close at short notice.

#### Visitor visas

If, despite our advice, you travel to Burkina Faso, be aware that entry and exit requirements can change at short notice.

Measures may be introduced without notice. Follow the advice of local authorities. Keep in contact with family and friends so they know you're safe and well.

Contact an embassy or consulate of Burkina Faso for details about visas, currency and customs.

The Australian High Commission in Accra has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in West Africa.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Burkina Faso. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Passport

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the Australian Passport Information Service.
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the West African Franc (CFA Franc, or XOF).

Declare all foreign currency and CFA on arrival.

#### Access to money

It's hard to exchange Australian dollars in Burkina Faso.

You can exchange US dollars and euros at commercial banks and exchange bureaus in major centres.

Some large hotels and restaurants in Ouagadougou accept credit cards.

Few businesses outside of the capital accept credit cards. There are few ATMs outside major cities.

Plan ahead and have enough cash to meet your needs. Contact your bank to make sure you can use your cards.

#### Local travel

To drive in Burkina Faso, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Apart from the national highways, most roads are in poor condition and poorly lit.

Many vehicles are also in poor condition.

Driving outside Ouagadougou at night is dangerous. Vehicles don't always use or have headlights. Livestock can stray onto roads.

Armed thieves target vehicles across the country. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety).

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance covers you for driving
* learn about local traffic laws and practices
* carry enough fuel and drinking water

To reduce your risks:

* don't drive at night
* keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* don't leave marked roads

If you travel outside Ouagadougou:

* get local advice on road and security conditions
* leave details of your travel plans with someone
* travel in a convoy
* carry a first aid kit and multiple ways to communicate

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines. It's best to book them through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Don't use public transport due to safety concerns and the risk of crime. Many public buses are poorly maintained, and serious accidents occur.

If you do use public transport despite our advice, protect your belongings, especially during overnight travel.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Burkina Faso's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XT) with the Aviation Safety Network.
