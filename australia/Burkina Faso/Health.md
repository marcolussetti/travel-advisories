#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Burkina Faso. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is common in Burkina Faso. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria), [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) and other insect-borne diseases are common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is high. Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [bilharzia](https://www.who.int/schistosomiasis/en/) (schistosomiasis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [meningococcal disease](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. Follow the advice of local authorities if there is an infectious disease outbreak.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are poor, and emergency services are very limited, particularly outside Ouagadougou.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be moved to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation is likely and can be very expensive. Ensure this is covered by your travel insurance.
