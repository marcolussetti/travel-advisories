# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling. Burkina Faso authorities may define certain behaviours and activities as criminal that would not be considered as such in Australia. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or harsh enforcement of local laws for unintentionally breaking the law.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs are severe. You could receive a heavy fine or a long jail sentence.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to take photos of military zones, assets or personnel.

It's also illegal to export art without approval from the Ministry of Culture. This can include:

* old or traditional artisan works
* all old material of national cultural significance

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas.

If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
