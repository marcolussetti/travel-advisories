# Overview

Latest update

We've reviewed our advice and continue to advise do not travel to Burkina Faso due to the dangerous security situation and the high threat of terrorism, kidnapping and violent crime. You're subject to all local laws and penalties, which can be interpreted broadly and applied harshly by Australian standards. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or enforcement of local laws for unintentionally breaking the law (see 'Local laws').  
  
There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorism and kidnapping throughout Burkina Faso. The security situation in Burkina Faso continues to be volatile. Terrorist attacks can occur throughout Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou. Attacks could happen in places visited by foreigners, including airports, public transport and transportation hubs, tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets and hotels. The kidnapping risk of foreign nationals remains high in Burkina Faso. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted (see 'Safety').   
  
The Australian High Commission in Accra has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in Burkina Faso. The Canadian Embassy can provide limited emergency consular assistance to Australians (see 'Local contacts').
