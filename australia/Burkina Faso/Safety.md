#### Terrorism

The security situation across Burkina Faso is dangerous and volatile, and there's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping.

Terrorists and other armed groups regularly conduct attacks targeting security forces, civilians and foreign interests. These groups have fuelled inter-community tensions in the area, resulting in regular ethnic group clashes. There are ongoing military operations throughout the country. 

If you're in Burkina Faso, despite our advice, you should consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so.

Further attacks are very likely, including in the capital Ouagadougou. Attacks can occur in places visited by foreigners, including:

* airports, public transport and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels
* hospitals
* places of worship
* mining operations
* embassies and government buildings, including schools
* security installations and areas frequented by security forces

If, despite our advice, you travel to Burkina Faso, stay alert to protect yourself from terrorism:

* get professional security advice
* use effective personal security measures
* be alert to possible threats in public places
* avoid all large gatherings, including festivals, large sporting events and any public demonstrations or protests
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for threats, curfews, and other restrictions
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities
* register for security alerts from the [US Embassy in Burkina Faso](https://bf.usembassy.gov/category/alert/) and the Canadian Embassy in Burkina Faso
* be ready to leave the country at short notice

Have an exit plan ready if you must go to a place that is a possible target.

If an attack occurs, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

Kidnapping by terrorist groups is a very high risk across Burkina Faso. 

Several foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso. Active terrorist groups maintain the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners.  

The kidnapping risk of foreign nationals in southern Burkina Faso is increasing. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted. 

Possible targets include: 

* foreign mining interests
* aid workers
* long-term residents of Burkina Faso
* foreign nationals

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.  

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:  

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. 

Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Two coups d’état occurred in Burkina Faso in 2022. A transitional government assumed control following the second coup d’état in September 2022. The situation remains unstable and could deteriorate rapidly. Following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there's a heightened risk of increased instability in Burkina Faso. Monitor security alerts from the [US Embassy in Burkina Faso](https://bf.usembassy.gov/) and the [Canadian Embassy in Burkina Faso](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/burkina_faso/ouagadougou.aspx?lang=eng).

A state of emergency is in place in the following 8 regions: Centre-Est, Est, Centre Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun, Sahel, Hauts-Bassins and Cascades. Local authorities periodically declare a state of emergency in various regions due to terrorism threats. The measure gives security forces extra powers to conduct searches, restrict freedom of movement and detain persons of interest. Some civil rights may be suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large meetings.

If, despite our advice, you travel to a region where a state of emergency is in effect:

* be aware that you may be subject to searches by security forces
* always cooperate with military and police officers
* carry valid ID at all times and be prepared for various checkpoints
* allow extra time to reach your destination
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local news to stay informed on the current situation

Maintain a stock of supplies, including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies, in case you need to shelter in place.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Demonstrations may occur throughout Burkina Faso with little or no warning. Expect roadblocks or groups of large demonstrators in central Ouagadougou and the surrounding area. Avoid large gatherings, particularly in the lead-up to, during and in the aftermath of key dates in your location, monitor media and follow the advice of local authorities.

To reduce your risk during periods of unrest:

* avoid rallies, protests and crowds
* monitor the media for possible unrest
* avoid affected areas
* follow advice from local authorities

If a protest happens near you, leave the area as soon as it's safe.

Maintain a stock of supplies, including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies, in case you need to shelter in place.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Crime can occur across the country. Attacks can happen anywhere. Foreigners may be targeted. Be mindful of your surroundings and personal security.

Purse snatchings and muggings are common, especially in Bobo Dioulasso and Ouagadougou.

Thefts are sometimes committed by one or two people on a motorbike.

Security risks increase at night.

Take sensible precautions. Don't carry valuables in public places or walk alone at night.

#### Violent crime

Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country. Buses and other vehicles are targeted, especially on main and secondary roads connecting major cities within Burkina Faso and nearby countries. Armed thieves use roadblocks to stop vehicles and may open fire. Some thieves use spotters to identify victims at roadhouses and checkpoints.

Criminals in urban areas may carry a knife or sharp weapon to cut the straps on bags, purses, or backpacks and can become violent if the victim resists.

Residential thefts/home invasions occur occasionally in the Ouagadougou expatriate community and in other parts of Ouagadougou. Thieves enter residences at night. Most perpetrators exploit an unlocked door or window. To reduce your risk of crime:

* avoid travelling alone or after dark
* pay close attention to your personal security, particularly in crowds
* keep your car windows and doors locked, even when you're moving
* drive in a convoy outside of urban areas
* don't visit banks or use ATMs alone
* only use ATMs in banks, hotels and other buildings with security

#### Scams and fraud

Internet fraud is common and often starts in West African countries. People have lost money to internet [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams).

Internet scams may present to you as romances, friendships, or business and employment opportunities. These scams usually start via internet dating sites or chat rooms.

Victims have also travelled to West African countries to meet a friend or someone they intend to marry that they have met online or to get back money. They've been at risk of [kidnapping,](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)[assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault) and robbery. Some victims have been killed.

Criminals might:

* ask you to send money so they can travel to Australia to meet you
* ask for details of a bank account overseas to transfer large amounts of money as a donation or for a percentage
* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of large quantities of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* steal money from people they have invited to Africa for a business opportunity

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If you're the victim of a scam, get legal advice. Don't travel to Burkina Faso to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been detained for their comments on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Also be aware of the materials you carry on your electronic devices.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Flooding

Flooding may occur in the wet season from June to October. Floods can close roads.

[Severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident) can affect your travel. Monitor local media for up-to-date information.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Burkina Faso and you're visiting an area affected by severe weather:

* confirm your plans with your tour operator or travel provider
* ask your tour operator if services have been affected

In the event of flooding and severe weather, follow the advice of local authorities.
