#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/node/46) for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Burkina Faso.

You can access consular help from the Canadian Embassy in Ouagadougou. It can issue [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents). The Embassy of Canada in Ouagadougou is closed for in-person appointments due to security reasons. For consular assistance, please contact the Embassy by phone or email.

You can also get consular help from the Australian High Commission in Ghana. [Subscribe](https://subscription.smartraveller.gov.au/subscribe/?destination=281) to this travel advice to get the latest updates directly.
