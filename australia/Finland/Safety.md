# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

You might encounter protests or demonstrations.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

During periods of unrest:

* monitor the media and other sources about possible unrest
* avoid the affected area
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

Serious crime isn't common.

Pickpocketing and bag-snatching occurs.

Credit card theft and skimming also happens.

To protect yourself from crime:

* check for card-skimming devices before using ATMs
* monitor local media for the latest crime trends

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
