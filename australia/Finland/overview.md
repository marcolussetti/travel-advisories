## Overview

### Safety

* Finland's terrorism threat level is 'elevated' (level 3 of 5). Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.
* Protests or demonstrations can take place. Monitor the media and avoid affected areas.
* Pickpocketing and purse snatching is common. Credit card theft and skimming also occurs. Check for card-skimming devices before using ATMs. Monitor the media for news on crime.
* Winters are extremely cold. There's heavy snowfall, including in metropolitan areas. Finland also experiences severe storms, rockslides, floods and strong winds. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Finland has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Australia, allowing Australians who visit for fewer than 90 days to receive some coverage for emergency medical services. You will still need to pay a client fee for all public health care treatment. This doesn't replace the need for travel insurance.
* The standard of medical facilities is similar to Australia. The main hospitals are in the Helsinki, Tampere and Turku areas.
