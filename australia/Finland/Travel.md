#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Finland is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). In some situations, this lets you enter Finland without a visa.

For more information about visa requirements, refer to the [Finnish Immigration Service](https://migri.fi/en/home).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Finland](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/69) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Entry into Finland

If you're arriving from non-EU and non-Schengen countries, you must have regular travel documents:

* a passport and, if necessary,
* a visa

#### Border measures

When you first enter the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), get an entry stamp in your passport from border control.

Always carry your passport.

If you have one, always carry your Finnish residency permit. You may be asked to verify your identity.

Always carry a valid passport even if travelling from another Schengen country.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Finland](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/69) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries will only let you enter if your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're only transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### ​Money

The currency of Finland is the euro.

Declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent currency if you're travelling between Finland and any non-European Union (EU) country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You don't need to declare cash if travelling to or from another EU country.
