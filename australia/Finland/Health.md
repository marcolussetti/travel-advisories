#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Finland. Take enough legal medicine for your trip. Your personal supply can include:

* prescription medications
* homoeopathic products

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

If you plan to stay longer than 3 months, find a doctor and pharmacy early in your stay who can re-supply your prescription medicines.

Prescribed narcotics are restricted. Check with the [Finnish Customs Authority.](http://tulli.fi/en/frontpage)

#### Health risks

Tick-borne encephalitis is a risk if you travel in forest areas or to the Aland Islands.

Ticks are common in rural areas and are active from March to November.

To protect yourself from illness:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

After visiting forested areas:

* check yourself for ticks
* remove any ticks as soon as possible
* keep checking the tick site for infection

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is similar to Australia.

Emergency services are limited in remote areas.

Major hospitals are located in the Helsinki, Tampere and Turku areas.

English is widely spoken.

A reciprocal health care agreement (RHCA) allows Australians who visit for fewer than 90 days to access emergency medical services for free.

It doesn't provide the same amount of coverage as Medicare in Australia. It doesn't cover:

* ongoing treatment of pre-existing health conditions
* medical evacuation
* prescription medicines
* elective surgery

To get emergency treatment, you must present an Australian passport and a valid Medicare card. You may also need to mention the RHCA.

If you can't show your passport and Medicare card, you may need to pay the same costs that apply to non-residents.

This arrangement doesn't replace the need for private travel insurance with medical coverage.
