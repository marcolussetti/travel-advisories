## Overview

### Safety

* There's heightened political and social tension in Guinea, including in the capital Conakry. The situation may deteriorate without warning.
* Violent protests have taken place in Conakry and other towns, resulting in several deaths. Avoid protests and public gatherings and remain vigilant. Follow the advice of local authorities. Monitor local media for updates.
* There's a risk of violent and petty crime. Keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving. Stay alert after dark or if there's a power outage.
* The border regions are dangerous. Armed robbery, conflict, and cross-border military and rebel activity is common in these regions.
* There's an increasing risk of foreign nationals being kidnapped along the border areas with Mali. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted.
* Internet scams often originate in West African countries. Be wary of online contact from people you don't know. Don't send money until you've checked who you're sending it to. Don't travel to Guinea to get your money back or to get revenge.

### Health

* Yellow fever, malaria, dengue, Zika virus, filariasis and other insect-borne diseases are common. Make sure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* There's currently an outbreak of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa. Mpox can be fatal. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* HIV/AIDS is common in Guinea. Take precautions if engaging in high-risk activities.
* If there is a serious outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Medical and emergency services are very limited. You may need to pay cash up-front, even in an emergency. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Make sure you have the right insurance and enough money to cover all your costs.

### Travel

* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Guinea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/82) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. Authorities may close borders at short notice.
* Expect travel bans, curfews and other restrictions on your movement. Air travel may be cancelled at short notice or borders closed in response to political unrest. Some limited commercial flights are operating. Contact your airline for more information.
* You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter and exit Guinea.
* Road travel can be dangerous, especially after dark. Robberies, accidents and fuel shortages are common.
* Fuel and water shortages occur regularly. An explosion at Guinea’s primary fuel depot in December 2023 worsened this situation. You should maintain emergency supplies.
