#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [Embassy of the Republic of Guinea](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/82) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Expect travel bans, curfews and other restrictions on your movement. Air travel may be cancelled at short notice or borders closed in response to political unrest. Some limited commercial flights are operating. Contact your airline for more information.

These measures can change at short notice. Check with the nearest [Guinea Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/82) or [Guinea Ministry of Health](https://sante.gov.gn/) (in French) for details.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Guinea. You may be asked to show it when you leave.

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to travel to other countries after visiting Guinea.

#### Passports

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the  [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Guinean franc (GNF). Banks accept international credit cards and can exchange money.

Traveller's cheques and credit cards are only accepted at some major hotels in Conakry. ATMs are unreliable, only dispense small amounts of cash and often don’t accept foreign cards. They should be used only at reputable hotels, stores, and banks.

Exchanging currency on the street is illegal. Foreign nationals have been arrested and held in military custody for using unofficial money changers even for small amounts, including at the airport.

Outside of the capital, banks are limited and you will likely have to use cash.

#### Local travel

Fuel and water shortages occur regularly. These shortages affect transportation. An explosion at Guinea’s primary fuel depot in December 2023 has exacerbated the shortages. Local authorities may implement emergency measures including closing gas stations across the country or limiting fuel supply with limited notice. Ensure you maintain stores of food, water and emergency supplies.

#### Road travel

Road travel can be hazardous, especially during the rainy season from May to October. Roads, even within Conakry, can be flooded and become impassable. Many roads are not paved.  Travel after dark is dangerous. [Robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery) and accidents are common.

The Guinean authorities maintain police and local militia checkpoints across the whole country, including on the Conakry airport road. They may ask to search your vehicle and baggage. Officials or people posing as officials may try to extort money from foreigners. Carry identification with you at all times.

When driving, you must be able to show:

* original vehicle documents
* registration
* car ownership papers
* valid driver’s licence
* proof of road insurance
* vehicle safety check certificate

Police or other law enforcement may ask you for these documents. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown instead of your actual passports or identification cards.

Driving hazards include:

* poor driving habits
* no road or traffic signs
* poorly maintained vehicles and roads
* pedestrians and stray animals

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Guinea than in Australia. In the event of an accident, proceed to the nearest police station or medical facility. Roadside assistance and ambulance services are not available.

Travelling only during the day in a reliable, well-maintained four-wheel-drive vehicle with spare tires is strongly recommended. Consider driving in a convoy when possible.

Fuel shortages are common. There may be roadblocks in Conakry and across the country, particularly at night.

#### Public transport

Guinea has no official public transportation system. Taxis are common, but vehicle and driving standards can be very poor. Avoid the use of moto-taxis and shared taxis/tuk-tuks. Crime occurs in taxis and on long-distance buses, which are often overcrowded and poorly maintained.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Guinea's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=3X) with the Aviation Safety Network.
