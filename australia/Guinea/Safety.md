# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

A coup d’état occurred in Guinea on 5 September 2021. There's ongoing heightened political and social tension, including in the capital Conakry. There's potential for the situation to deteriorate without warning.

There is a high risk of violence during a general strike (‘ville morte’). In the event of a strike, shops could close for long periods of time with little warning. Ensure that you maintain stores of food, water and emergency supplies, sufficient to last at least three to four days.

Be cautious during large public gatherings like football matches. Poor infrastructure and limited exits can create serious risks in an emergency.

Disruptions to communication networks and internet service can occur with little notice, especially during periods of civil unrest. Certain websites and social media have been restricted by the government.

The Australian High Commission in Accra has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in Guinea.

#### Demonstrations and protests

In May 2022, the military junta banned political demonstrations until further notice. Since then, riot police have used tear gas and warning shots to disperse crowds of protesters. Public gatherings and demonstrations still occur. They can start with little or no notice and quickly turn violent, resulting in injuries and deaths.

Increased tensions and hostilities can be caused by:

* lack of access to basic services
* instability in neighbouring countries
* armed bandits
* ethnic tensions

Vehicles have been attacked while attempting to pass through or around demonstrations. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.

[Demonstrations](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/demonstrations) and strikes may disrupt goods and basic services, including road transport and international flights.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests, street rallies and public gatherings
* leave an affected area as soon as it's safe
* follow the advice of local authorities
* remain vigilant, monitor the media for updates, safety and security risks
* keep water and food supplies to last several days
* always have access to cash, medication and a first-aid kit
* keep your car fuelled and phone charged

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime happens in Conakry and other parts of Guinea. This includes:

* [assaults](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery), hold-ups and muggings
* break-ins and burglars may be armed
* minor theft
* carjacking

The risk of violent incidences can happen anytime but increases after dark. Crimes may be perpetrated by persons wearing military or police uniforms who are armed.

Foreigners are often the target of crime, especially at the airport. If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark, arrange your airport transfer before you travel. When travelling outside of Conakry, try to complete all travel before nightfall.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse-snatching, occurs at the airport, in markets, taxis or communal transport, and near popular hotels and restaurants. These crimes are often done by children.

Frequent power outages may worsen security conditions, especially in large urban centres. This often leads to more crime, especially if street and traffic lights fail.

To protect yourself from violent and petty crime:

* be vigilant while driving in Conakry and surrounding areas, especially when travelling to and from Conakry International Airport
* drive with doors locked and windows up at all times, even when moving
* exercise caution at the airports. Arrange to arrive during the day and be met by reliable contacts
* keep your passport and valuables in a secure place
* don’t wear expensive-looking jewellery or watches and keep mobiles out of sight
* ensure your accommodation is secure and has security guards
* stay alert after dark or if there's a power failure
* don't walk alone at night

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

There have been reports of police extorting cash from foreigners and Guineans.

There are reports of trading scams involving diamonds, gold export and gold certification. This trade attracts criminal gangs and can involve kidnapping and extortion.

Internet [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") may come in the form of romance, friendship, business and employment opportunities. These scams often originate in West African countries.

If you travel to West Africa as a scam victim, you are at risk of:

* financial loss
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* murder

This includes travelling to meet a friend or love interest, as well as trying to get your money back or get revenge.

Commercial and relationship scams are common fraud schemes.

In commercial scams, criminals ask for details of safe bank accounts to transfer large amounts of money. They may also:

* promise a percentage of this amount to you
* send fake cashier cheques for urgent goods shipments
* request large fees for a fake government contract
* extort money from you for a bogus business opportunity

In relationship scams, criminals often meet their victims through internet dating sites or chat rooms. Once they have formed a connection, they may:

* ask you to send money so they can come to Australia
* ask you to come to Africa to meet them

Once you transfer money, the relationship often ends. If you travel to Guinea to meet the criminals, you may be in danger.

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Guinea to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Pirates

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") and armed robbery has been reported in the coastal waters.

The [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org/map/) issues piracy reports.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
The risk of foreign nationals being kidnapped along the border areas with southern Mali is increasing. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted.  
  
If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

More information on how to reduce your risk of being kidnapped: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorists may target hotels, beaches and restaurants.

Recent attacks have happened in West Africa, particularly in:

* [Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)](/destinations/africa/cote-divoire-ivory-coast "Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)")
* [Burkina Faso](/destinations/africa/burkina-faso "Burkina Faso")
* [Mali](/destinations/africa/mali "Mali")

#### Border region

Instability in neighbouring countries and armed banditry in West Africa pose a risk in Guinea. Exercise a high degree of caution near the borders with Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone,  where ongoing cross-border military and rebel activities make these areas unsafe.

Do not travel to the region bordering Mali as there is a heightened risk of terrorist activity due to the presence of armed groups and militias. Clashes between armed groups and security forces could take place in the area.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Severe weather

The wet season is from May to October.

In flooding, unsealed roads may become impassable without warning. The following essential services can also be affected:

* transport and infrastructure
* electricity distribution
* water and food supply
* emergency services

Take caution and seek local advice. Monitor local media for up-to-date information on weather conditions and border crossing status prior to travel.

Follow the advice of local authorities if [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") occurs.
