# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Serious crime

Serious crimes, such as murder and armed robbery, can attract the death penalty.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include prison sentences in local jails.

#### Proof of identity

You must always carry original ID documents. Police and law enforcement can request to see them. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.

#### Other laws

You can't export precious stones from Guinea without a licence. If you can't show a licence, authorities may imprison you. Strict regulations may also apply to the movement of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, and ivory. Ensure you have the required permits.

It's illegal to take photos or videos of strategic assets including military, police or government buildings, the President’s residences and offices, or airports and bridges. You may get arrested. Photographing without permission in any public area may result in arrest or a dangerous confrontation with people who find being photographed offensive.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Guinea. Fines or jail sentences may apply.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Guinea recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
