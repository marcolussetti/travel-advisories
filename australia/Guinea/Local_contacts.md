Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Guinea.

The [Canadian Embassy](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/senegal/dakar.aspx?lang=eng) in Senegal can give consular assistance to Australians in Guinea, including issuingÂ [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/getting-passport-how-it-works/special-travel-documents).
