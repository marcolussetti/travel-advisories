#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Guinea. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Ebola virus disease

Guinea has experienced an outbreak of [Ebola virus disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease) in the past. Protect yourself against the disease by practising good hygiene. Cholera and malaria are also present in Guinea and have similar early symptoms to Ebola. 

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever) is widespread in Guinea. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel (see the 'Travel' section for vaccination requirements).

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is also widespread in Guinea, along with [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis), [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) and other insect-borne diseases (World Health Organization).

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Guinea.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any mpox symptoms.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) (World Health Organization) is common in Guinea. Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Lassa fever

[Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever) (World Health Organization) may be a risk when you have contact with rodents or with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings.

To protect yourself from disease:

* avoid contact with live or dead rodents, burrows or nests and their droppings
* ensure all foods are well-cooked and covered in rodent-proof containers
* keep your body, personal belongings, utensils and common contact surfaces (including door knobs and counters) clean
* avoid places where dust is raised, such as from sweeping and vacuuming rodent droppings

Get immediate medical help if you develop any symptoms of Lassa fever, including a fever, weakness in your body or unexplained pain.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [lassa fever](https://www.who.int/health-topics/lassa-fever/#tab=tab_1)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19?language=und)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. If there is an outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water, which can expose you to waterborne diseases
* avoid contact with dogs, cats and other animals

Get medical attention straight away if an animal scratches or bites you

#### Medical care

There's a severe lack of medical equipment and medicine throughout Guinea. Equipment is basic and often not sterile. Carry basic medical supplies and a first aid kit.

There are some well-stocked pharmacies in Conakry but few outside the capital. Check that medicine is genuine.

Health facilities are limited in Conakry. Outside of the capital, the standard of facilities is poor.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease or major incidents.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you are seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be moved to a place with better facilities via a medical evacuation. Medical evacuations are extremely expensive.
