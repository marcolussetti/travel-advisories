# Safety

#### Crime

Be alert, particularly if you're out after dark.

Violent crime, residential break-ins and carjackings, particularly of 4WD vehicles, occur.

Street crime is more common in urban centres.

Police resources are varied throughout Botswana.

Criminals have [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") travellers in the areas of Gaborone Dam and Kgale Hill in the capital, Gaborone. Exercise caution in these areas.

If you're [sexually](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") or otherwise [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), seek medical help straight away. See ([Health](#health)).

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
