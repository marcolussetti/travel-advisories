#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some medication may be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Botswana. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Keep medications in their original packaging with a clear label.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Yellow fever

If you're travelling from a country where yellow fever is widespread, you'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Botswana. This does not apply if you're under one year old.

If you can't show proof of vaccination, authorities may not let you enter.

You can't get vaccinated when you arrive.

#### HIV/AIDS

Botswana's rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is very high. Take precautions before you do anything that puts you at risk of infection.

If you're [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), [sexually](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") or otherwise, seek medical help straight away.

#### Swimming risks

Don't swim in lakes and rivers because of the possibility of:

* wildlife attacks
* catching waterborne diseases

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs throughout Botswana. It's widespread in the country's north, especially in the rainy season from November to March.

Other insect-borne diseases also occur, including [filariasis.](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)

To protect yourself from insect-borne diseases:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria if you travel north of Gaborone.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/node/348) are widespread. This includes:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. Some drug-resistant tuberculosis cases are reported in Botswana.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Don't swim in fresh water to avoid exposure to certain waterborne diseases, such as [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis).

Get urgent medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities outside urban areas are limited and are not of a high standard in some places.

Public and private medical facilities ask you to confirm insurance cover or guarantee payment before treatment.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you could need treatment at a more suitable place. This is usually Namibia or South Africa. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
