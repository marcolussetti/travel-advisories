#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You don't need a visa if you're a tourist visiting for up to 90 days. If you're travelling with children, you may need extra documents.

Botswana accepts Australian emergency passports. But, if you need to enter Botswana on an emergency passport, you'll need to apply for a visa before you go. You can't get one on arrival.

Apply at the nearest [embassy or consulate of Botswana](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/29).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/29) for visa details, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Botswana if you arrive from a country where yellow fever is widespread.

#### Other formalities

#### Travel with children

Immigration regulations apply to children younger than 18 years.

All [children travelling](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") to Botswana must have a passport and full birth certificate. The birth certificate must identify the child and parents.

You must show these documents on request.

Any parents who aren't travelling need to provide a legal document giving their consent for the child to travel.

The legal document must be less than 3 months old and include:

* full names, addresses, phone numbers, and passport details of the child and both parents, as listed on the birth certificate
* travel destinations of child and parent
* a certified copy of the passport of any non-travelling parent
* signatures of both parents

If you don't comply with these rules, you might be:

* stopped from boarding your plane
* deported on arrival

The nearest [embassy or consulate of Botswana](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/29) can tell you what you need to have on the document.

#### Travel via South Africa

Refer to the [travel advice for South Africa](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/south-africa) on entry requirements.

South Africa has specific documentation rules for children and doesn't accept [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/getting-passport-how-it-works/special-travel-documents). It also requires travellers to carry a yellow fever vaccination certificate.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Make sure your passport has 2 blank pages. If it doesn't, authorities may stop you when you try to leave.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Botswana is the Pula (BWP).

You must declare any foreign currency that's over the equivalent value of Pula 10,000 when you enter and leave Botswana.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Road travel in Botswana can be dangerous. Wild animals and livestock often stray onto roads and have the right of way.

To drive in Botswana, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) and
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

Be careful when driving from the airport into Gaborone at night.

Driving outside major urban areas in Botswana can be hazardous. This is mainly due to the following:

* poor road conditions
* local driving practices
* inadequate lighting

Batswana, the people of Botswana, take injuries or deaths of their cattle by motorists very seriously.

If you're driving long distances, carefully plan your trip because of the harsh environment and sparse population.

If you travel to remote desert areas, use a reputable guide. Take a 4WD vehicle with emergency provisions.

The condition of urban roads is mostly good.
