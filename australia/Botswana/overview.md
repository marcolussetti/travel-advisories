### Health

* The HIV/AIDS infection rate is very high. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus. If you're sexually or physically assaulted, seek medical help straight away.
* A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required if you are over one year old and travelling from a country where yellow fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel.
* Malaria is present in Botswana and widespread in the north. Other insect-borne diseases, including [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis) (commonly known as elephantiasis), occur. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are widespread. Only drink boiled or bottled water. Some drug-resistant tuberculosis cases have recently occurred in Botswana. Take extra precautions with food and drink.
* Medical facilities and supplies outside urban areas are limited, and in some areas they're not of a high standard. You may have to be evacuated if you're seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation is expensive and hard to organise. Check if your insurance covers this.
