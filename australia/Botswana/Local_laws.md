# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're detained or arrested, the Botswana authorities may not automatically notify the Australian Government. Ask police or prison officials to contact the [Australian High Commission in South Africa](https://southafrica.embassy.gov.au/pret/contact-us.html) if you're arrested or detained.

Police resources are varied throughout Botswana.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include mandatory jail sentences. This includes offences involving marijuana (cannabis).

#### Death penalty

Serious offences, including murder and treason, carry the death penalty.

#### Wildlife laws

Exporting elephant hair, ivory, and rhinoceros horn products is illegal.

If you want to export animal souvenirs or 'trophies', you need either:

* a government permit
* a receipt from a licensed store

You must not observe wildlife closer than the minimum legal distance.

#### Other crimes

Some crimes, such as serious assaults, attract physical punishment.

In Botswana, it's illegal to:

* possess pornography
* take photos of military or government installations

Same-sex relationships were legalised in June 2019 but aren't widely accepted. Public displays of affection may receive negative attention.

#### Dual citizenship

Botswana only recognises dual nationality in certain circumstances. Otherwise, Botswana does not recognise dual nationality.

This limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give you if you're arrested or detained.
