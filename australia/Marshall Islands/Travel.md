#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll get a 30-day visitor visa on arrival if you can provide evidence of an outbound ticket. You can apply and pay to extend your visa at the Division of Immigration.

In other situations, you'll need an entry permit to:

* work
* study
* stay for more than 30 days

Rules affecting your visit can change at short notice.

Fines and deportation may apply to those who arrive without evidence of a return ticket.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the Division of Immigration for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Check with your airline or tour operator to confirm you meet all entry requirements.

For further information, see the [RMI Ministry of Health and Human Services Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/rmimoh/).

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you must meet US entry or transit requirements. This includes transit via Honolulu or Guam. Check with your nearest [US embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212).

#### Other formalities

#### Travelling with children

If you're [travelling with a child](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") who isn't your own, carry a [notarised](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") letter of consent from their legal guardian.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe, waterproof place.

Due to the remoteness and limited transport to and within the Marshall Islands, a replacement passport may take longer to reach the Marshall Islands.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the US Dollar (USD). While many business in Majuro and Ebeye take credit cards, others do not. There are only a few ATMs in the Marshall Islands. Carry cash with you. The airport departure fee must be paid in USD cash.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You can drive for up to 30 days with either:

* an Australian driver's licence, or
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

After 30 days, you must get a local licence.

You must carry your licence when you drive.

If you don't have a licence, your insurance may not cover you.

#### Road travel

Drive on the right-hand side of the road.

Driving can be hazardous due to:

* poorly maintained roads
* poor driving standards
* lack of streetlights

Road conditions can deteriorate after heavy rain.

#### Sea travel

Sea travel is common in the Marshall Islands. But travelling by boat, especially on open waters between atolls, can be hazardous. Vessels and their operators often do not meet Australian safety standards. Vessels may not have enough life jackets for all passengers, may not carry emergency equipment and beacons, and may not be suitable for the proposed travel.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual maritime providers or sea routes.

To reduce your risk on boats, take appropriate precautions:

* check with your tour operator/crew to determine safety standards, provision of safety equipment and whether the vessel and the conditions are appropriate for the proposed travel, especially on open waters between atolls
* wear your own life jacket during travel and carry an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) or personal locator beacon (PLB)
* avoid single-engine vessels and those with insufficient horsepower for the proposed travel
* avoid travelling at night unless the vessel is appropriately equipped, and the conditions are appropriate for the proposed travel
* monitor weather advisories, including for maritime craft advisories
* tell someone you trust about your plans, including when you expect to reach your destination or return.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check the [Marshall Islands' air safety profile](http://smartraveller.gov.au/services/pages/consular-services-charter.aspx) with the Aviation Safety Network.
