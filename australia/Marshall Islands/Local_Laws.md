# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug-related offences, including marijuana use, are severe. You could get a long jail term or heavy fine.

#### LGBTQIA+ Travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal, but cultural attitudes can be conservative. Avoid public displays of affection.

#### Dress standards

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative. Take care not to offend.

If you're a woman, wear clothing to covers your knees and shoulders outside of resorts.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when youâ€™re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
