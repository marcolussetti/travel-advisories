# Safety

#### Crime

The crime rate in Marshall Islands is low.

Petty crime such as house break-ins, theft and [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") occur. Alcohol plays a role in most crimes, especially assaults.

Your risk of being affected by crime increases:

* at night
* early in the morning
* at isolated locations, such as beaches

Pay attention to your personal security.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Civil unrest is uncommon in Marshall Islands. However, public protests that draw large groups of people have a risk of turning violent.

Avoid protests and demonstrations.

Monitor the news and other sources for advice of possible unrest. Avoid affected areas.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This applies to adventure sports, such as diving and yachting.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider or otherwise, don’t undertake the activity.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Typhoons and severe weather

Marshall Islands experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including tropical storms and occasionally [typhoons](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), which can cause:

* localised flooding
* disruptions to services

The low-lying islands and atolls are less than 2m above sea level.  Urban centres are susceptible to flooding from waves and king tides.

The direction and strength of typhoons can change suddenly.

Typhoon season is from July to November, with peaks in August and September. However, typhoons can occur at any time.

To reduce your risks during typhoon season:

* know your hotel or cruise ship evacuation plans
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* contact your tour operator to check affected services

If the area is affected by a typhoon:

* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* access to ports could be affected
* adequate shelter may not be available

Contact your airline for flight updates.

To protect yourself during a typhoon:

* identify your local shelter
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media and the [World Meteorological Organisation Severe Weather Information Centre](http://severe.worldweather.org/)
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Tsunamis

All oceanic regions of the world can experience [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"). However, the Pacific Ocean has a higher risk of large, destructive tsunamis.
