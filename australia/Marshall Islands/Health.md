#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Health risks

#### Measles

Due to measles outbreaks in several regions, the Marshall Islands currently requires all children under 5 years of age to have their vaccinations for MMR (Measles and Rubella) up-to-date. This includes immunization for infants aged between 6 months and 11 months. Proof of vaccination must be presented on arrival or entry will be refused. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Outbreaks of [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) can occur. Some outbreaks can be serious.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Hepatitis A

Cases of [hepatitis A](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-a) have occurred. It's a viral liver disease that can cause serious illness.

You can catch hepatitis A by:

* eating contaminated food
* drinking contaminated water
* having contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person

Get vaccinated against hepatitis A at least 4 weeks before you go.

If you're not vaccinated, handwashing is important to prevent hepatitis A. Wash your hands with soap and running water for at least 10 seconds:

* after going to the toilet
* before eating
* before preparing food or drink
* after touching objects like nappies and condoms

Dry your hands on a clean towel.

STIs are common in Marshall Islands. Take safety precautions.

#### Hepatitis B

Hepatitis B is endemic in Marshall Islands. You should seek medical advice on vaccination if your lifestyle places you at risk of infection.

#### Mumps

Get vaccinated against mumps with the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine (2 doses) before you go.

#### Other health risks

Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases are a risk.

To reduce your risk of illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get urgent medical attention if you have a fever or diarrhoea or if you suspect food poisoning.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The Marshall Islands is a remote destination. The availability of medicines and medical supplies can be disrupted. Ensure you bring a supply of all medications and medical supplies you require for the duration of your stay. Hospital facilities and medical supplies are limited.

Medical evacuation:

* may be required if you're seriously ill or injured
* may be delayed due to infrequent flights
* can be very expensive due to the Marshall Islands’ remote location.

You may need to pay up-front for medical services.
