# Safety

#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Austria. An attack could occur anywhere at any time. In recent years, there have been terrorist attacks, most recently in February 2025 in Villach, and planned attacks have been disrupted. Austrian authorities have assessed the current terrorism threat level as High, the second highest on a five-step scale. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.

Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or gatherings celebrating religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* crowded outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be alert to possible threats
* be cautious around known targets, including in crowds and public places
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously, including alert sirens, public broadcast announcements and sms to your mobile phone
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Hotspots for crime include:

* Vienna's largest train stations — Hauptbahnhof, Westbahnhof and Meidling
* International trains and buses

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings in crowded areas and on trains, buses and taxis
* Do not place valuables in the overhead storage area on trains
* carry your belongings, including your passport, on your body
* be alert to suspicious behaviour
* don't walk on isolated streets alone after dark

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people are usually peaceful but can turn violent. They can disrupt traffic and public transport.

Protests in Vienna are usually held around the Ring Road and on the Mariahilfer Strasse shopping street.

To stay safe:

* avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media
