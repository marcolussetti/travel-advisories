# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. Possessing even small amounts of illegal drugs can lead to prison sentences. This includes marijuana.

#### Other laws

You must always carry an ID, such as your passport. You may be asked to produce it by local police.

Preaching is illegal unless you belong to a registered religious group and have a permit.

If you're in public places or buildings, it's illegal to cover your face with clothing or objects so you can't be recognised.

You may be fined or have to attend a police station if:

* you refuse to uncover your face when asked
* it's not possible to confirm your identity

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
