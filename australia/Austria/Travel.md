#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Austria is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter the country without a visa in some cases.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/16/State) of Austria for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Ensure that you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian government can't assist you if you don't.

#### Border measures

Land borders are open, but you may be subject to random checks by Austrian authorities, particularly at borders with Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Czech Republic. See the [EU Notifications of Temporary Reintroduction of Border Controls](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area/temporary-reintroduction-border-control_en?fbclid=IwY2xjawGOZeVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHZbVGnM-TTWYtGVr-SdOGt9OJcZVDgPx4P3Zzjg1qHA7D5QKUirwodr1LQ_aem_PtBeTm_GSmjk3X02pXPBxQ) for more information.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/16/State) of Austria for details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

Make sure you:

* check that the entry stamp in your passport is readable when you enter the [Schengen](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen) area for the first time. Border officials may ask you to show them an onward or return ticket.
* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/visas).

#### Children

[Children](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/who-you-are/children) aged under 18 years who travel alone or with one parent may need a letter of consent from the non-travelling parents. Check with an [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) [or](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) [of Austria](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/16) for details.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Austria's currency is the Euro (EUR).

Only change money at banks or other authorised dealers or withdraw cash from ATMs.

Declare funds of more than 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Austria and a non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not just cash. Failure to do so will result in fines.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

If you are not a resident of Austria, you can drive on your Australian driver's licence for up to 12 months from your entry date (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

You must also have either:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP), or
* a German translation of your licence

If you're a resident of Austria, your foreign driver's licence is valid for 6 months from the start of your residency permit.

#### Road travel

Road conditions are generally good. However, roads in alpine areas can be hazardous in winter.

Some mountain roads may close for extended periods.

Winter tyres are mandatory from 1 November to 15 April when driving in winter conditions. Carry snow chains if driving in mountainous areas in winter.

To drive on the motorways (autobahn), you must display a current highway toll sticker called a Vignette.

You can buy a vignette:

* [online](https://www.asfinag.at/en/toll/vignette/)
* at border crossings
* from petrol stations near the border
* at post offices

Random vignette checks occur. You'll be fined if you don't have one.

You must have in your car:

* a first aid kit
* a warning triangle
* high-visibility warning vests

If you get out of your vehicle on the shoulder of the road, you must:

* put a warning triangle behind the vehicle
* wear high-visibility warning vests (driver and passengers)

Check your rental car has the required safety equipment.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer that your policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis are reliable and safe. Make sure the meter is running.

#### Public transport

Austria's public transport network is well-developed and reliable.

You'll be fined if you travel on public transport without a valid ticket.

To avoid a fine:

* follow all passenger notices
* validate your ticket before starting your journey
* keep your ticket until the end of your journey
* show your ticket to inspectors if asked
