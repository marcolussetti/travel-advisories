## Overview

### Safety

* There's an ongoing threat of terrorism in Austria. There have been terrorist attacks and arrests relating to planned attacks. Most recently, there was an attack in Villach in February 2025. Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities, including Vienna. Crowded places, such as music and cultural events, festivals, Pride events, tourist areas, Christmas markets, shopping areas, transport hubs, major sporting events and other public areas are possible targets. Be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local authorities. Report anything suspicious to the police.
* Petty crime, such as bag snatching and pickpocketing, is common. Be careful on public transport and in areas popular with tourists. Take care using ATMs.
* Avalanches, flash floods and mudslides occur in alpine areas. Monitor local weather. Follow the advice of local authorities. Stick to marked slopes and trails when skiing, hiking and mountain climbing.
