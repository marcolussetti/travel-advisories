# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations happen sometimes but are usually peaceful.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor local media for planned or possible action
* avoid rallies and protests
* follow the advice of local authorities

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest")

#### Crime

Crime rates are low, including for petty crime.

Taxi drivers have assaulted some passengers. However, taxis and other rideshare options are usually safe.

Some Australians have become victims of extortion [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers"). Examples include minor car accidents and claims of sexual assault at nightclubs.

To keep yourself safe:

* take care of your belongings, especially in crowded places
* report suspicious behaviour
* book taxis through a central dispatch service or your hotel

Card skimming occurs. Keep an eye on your card when making purchases.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you've been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Taiwan experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [typhoons](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident")
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

#### Typhoons

Typhoons happen in the wet or typhoon season from May to November. Flooding and mudslides are common.

The direction and strength of typhoons can change with little warning. In some areas, shelter from a severe typhoon may not be available to everyone.

If a typhoon is approaching, be aware that:

* flights in and out of affected areas could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* access to ports could be affected

If a typhoon is approaching, local authorities may declare a 'typhoon day' at very short notice. This means businesses may only open for a short time and government offices may close.

The [Australian Office in Taipei](http://www.australia.org.tw/tpei/home.html) may close on typhoon days (see '[Local contacts](#local-contacts)').

Authorities announce a 'typhoon day' on local radio and television stations. This includes [International Community Radio Taipei (ICRT)](http://www.icrt.com.tw/), which broadcasts in English.

Updates on typhoons and other severe weather are available from the [Taiwan Central Weather Administration](https://www.cwa.gov.tw/eng/). You can also keep up to date by checking:

* [World Meteorological Organisation Severe Weather Information Centre](http://severe.worldweather.org/)
* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)

To prepare yourself in case of a typhoon:

* know your hotel's or cruise ship's evacuation plans
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities on preparing for a natural disaster

If there's a typhoon or other natural disaster approaching:

* tune your radio to FM100.7 for English-language updates
* monitor the media, other local information sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay in touch with friends and family
* contact your airline for the latest flight information
* contact [Taoyuan International Airport](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/?lang=en), [Taipei Songshan Airport](https://www.tsa.gov.tw/?culture=2), or [Kaohsiung International Airport](https://www.kia.gov.tw/English/) for more information
* contact [Maritime and Port Bureau](https://www.motcmpb.gov.tw/En/) for information on ferries
* check the [Directorate-General of Personnel Administration](https://www.dgpa.gov.tw/typh/daily/ndse.html) for information on office and school closures
* contact your tour operator to check if services at your planned destinations have been affected

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes often occur and may disrupt city and regional [train services.](https://tip.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US) Confirm travel arrangements before travelling. Get advice on travelling to and living in an earthquake-prone region.

If you're planning to travel to Taroko or Hualien, [check the road conditions](https://www.taroko.gov.tw/en/TAROKO_HighwayCondition.aspx?n=7879) before you travel, as access may be affected by the earthquake that occurred on 3 April 2024.

Tsunamis are a risk because of frequent earthquakes in the region.

For more information check out:

* Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration’s [Seismological Center](https://scweb.cwa.gov.tw/en-US)
* Taiwan's Emergency Management Information Center [全民防災e點通 (emic.gov.tw)](https://bear.emic.gov.tw/MY/#/) APP for the latest information.
* the [US Tsunami Warning Center](https://tsunami.gov/) for information on earthquakes and tsunamis.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, check local media.
