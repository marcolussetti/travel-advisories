#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Taiwan has a visa-exempt entry scheme for nationals of designated countries, including Australia. Please see [Taiwan's Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html) website for the visa-exempt entry requirements and restrictions. You cannot enter Taiwan under the visa-exempt entry scheme if you have a criminal record. Taiwan's immigration authorities can refuse entry to people with criminal records or deport them from Taiwan.

You won't need a visa for Taiwan if you meet all these conditions:

* you'll only stay for up to 90 days
* you're visiting for tourism or business
* you have a confirmed return or onward air ticket
* your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the date of your entry
* you're not travelling on an emergency passport

In other situations, you'll need to get a visa before you travel.

Australians can use Taiwan's e-Gate service. To register for e-Gate, visit the e-Gate Enrolment Counters at the airport, located next to the e-Gate lanes at passport control. The registration is valid until 6 months before your passport's expiry date, until you renew your passport, or until you obtain an Alien Resident Card (ARC) in Taiwan. You'll need then to register each trip online to use the gates. More information is available at the[e-Gate Enrolment System website.](https://egate.immigration.gov.tw/egate-frontend/aus)

Working holiday-makers (WHM) must apply for the WHM visa before arriving. WHM visas are also valid as a work permit.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the [Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO)](https://www.roc-taiwan.org/au_en/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

International transits are permitted at Taiwan's airports. Refer to [Taoyuan International Airport](https://www.taoyuan-airport.com/turnaround?lang=en) or contact your airline or travel agent for more information on transiting Taiwan.

You'll be screened for high body temperature when you arrive. This is to guard against pandemics such as [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19), [SARS](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/) and bird flu ([avian influenza](http://www.health.gov.au/avian_influenza)). Depending on your results, you may need more medical tests.

#### Other formalities

If you plan to take prescription or non-prescription medicines with you, check the [Taiwan Customs](https://web.customs.gov.tw/etaipei) website before you travel (see '[Health')](#health).

If you're planning to work, you need to get a work permit before you start paid or unpaid work. Work permits are usually arranged in Taiwan through your employer.

If you work without a work permit or WHM visa, authorities could fine or deport you.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the [nearest embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD).

Declare amounts over USD10,000 or equivalent.

ATMs are widely available in cities and provincial centres.

International credit cards are usually accepted in hotels, restaurants and higher-end shops, especially in cities and larger towns.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

If you plan to drive in Taiwan, you must get an International Driving Permit (IDP) before you arrive.

You can drive for up to 30 days with an IDP and a current Australian licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

If you plan to stay longer, apply for an extension at the nearest motor vehicle office in Taiwan.

Check Taiwan’s [Highway Bureau](https://www.thb.gov.tw/en/cl.aspx?n=651) for information on how to apply for a Taiwanese Driver's Licence.

#### Road travel

Roads and vehicles are well maintained but scooters and motorcycles often weave in and out of traffic, and vehicles might not stop at pedestrian crossings. Look before stepping onto the road.

Heavy rain and typhoons can lead to landslides and road blockages.

Mountain roads are usually winding and narrow. Travellers have been injured in bus accidents on these roads.

To stay safe:

* don't expect traffic to stop at pedestrian crossings or traffic lights — look before stepping onto the road
* assess weather and road conditions before you drive, especially during typhoon season
* take particular care when driving on mountain roads

#### Motorcycles

You need a motorcycle licence, either Taiwanese or international, to hire a motorcycle.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Taxis and other rideshare options are usually safe. However, there have been instances of drivers assaulting passengers.

To minimise risk, use:

* taxis booked through a central dispatch service
* taxis booked through your hotel

#### Mountain hiking

Permits may be required for entering mountains in Taiwan. Ensure the phone location mode (GPS) on the mobile device is turned on. If you get lost in the mountains, dial 119 and follow the instructions to send your location. Alternatively, you can report the location number shown on a blue plate of the nearest electricity pole.

#### Public transport

Taiwan has well-developed rail and bus services.

Petty crime happens, so take care of your belongings.
