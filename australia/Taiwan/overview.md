## Overview

### Safety

* Crime rates are low, including for petty crime. Taxi drivers have sometimes assaulted passengers. However, taxis and other rideshare options are usually safe. Book taxis through a central dispatch service or your hotel.
* Extortion scams occur. These include minor car accidents and claims of sexual assault at nightclubs. Report suspicious behaviour.
* Protests happen sometimes. They're usually peaceful but can turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings.
* The typhoon season is from May to November. Flooding and mudslides are common. Businesses and government offices close on 'typhoon days'. Follow local advice to prepare for a disaster. Updates on typhoons and other severe weather are available from the [Taiwan Central Weather Administration](https://www.cwa.gov.tw/eng/).
* Earthquakes happen often and may disrupt [train services.](https://tip.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US) Confirm travel arrangements before travelling. Get advice on being in an earthquake-prone region. Tsunamis also happen. Know the tsunami warning signs and move to high ground straight away. Don't wait for official alerts.

### Health

* Some prescription medications are illegal in Taiwan. Authorities may jail or fine you if you have them. Before you travel, check [Taiwan Customs](https://web.customs.gov.tw/etaipei) for limits and documents you'll need.
* Insect-borne diseases such as Dengue and Japanese encephalitis occur. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Get vaccinated if vaccines are available.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases, such as hand, foot and mouth disease, are common. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid ice cubes. Wash your hands thoroughly and often.
* The standard of public hospitals in major cities is good. Wait times are often long. Some hospitals have English-speaking private clinics, but these can be expensive. You may have to pay up-front, even for emergency care. Ensure your travel insurance covers all medical costs.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs, including illegal prescription medication. Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty, life in prison, long jail terms and heavy fines.
* Taiwan recognises dual nationality. Taiwanese males older than 18 years must do military service. Some exemptions are available to overseas residents. If you're not exempt, you may have to serve when you arrive. Check Taiwan's [Department of Conscription Administration](https://dca.moi.gov.tw/Enaspx/Default.aspx) for details. Consular services may be limited for dual nationals who do not enter Taiwan on their Australian passport.

Refer to [Taiwan's Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html) website for requirements and restrictions. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.
