# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include life imprisonment and the death penalty.

Carrying certain prescription drugs can result in heavy fines and long jail sentences (see '[Health')](#health).

#### Other laws

If you're involved in a legal dispute, you won't be allowed to leave Taiwan until the dispute is settled. This includes minor offences.

You may be detained on arrival if you have an outstanding arrest warrant in Taiwan.

Legal processes can be long. Local authorities won't accept bonds or deposits to guarantee court appearances.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Taiwan recognises dual nationality. Taiwanese males aged over 18 must do military service. Some exemptions are available to overseas residents, but you should check this before travelling. If you're not exempt, you may have to serve when you arrive.

If you're a Taiwanese-Australian dual national and you're male, check before you travel.
