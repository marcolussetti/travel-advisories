#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some prescription medications are illegal in Taiwan. Authorities may jail or fine you for carrying these medications.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Taiwan. Take enough legal medicine with you for your trip.

[Taiwan Customs](https://web.customs.gov.tw/etaipei) gives advice on limits and documents you'll need.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) occurs, especially in the tropical southern and central regions.

You could also encounter [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) in Taiwan.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Speak with your doctor about getting vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.

#### Other health risks

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/archives/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) is common. Sometimes serious outbreaks occur. Outbreaks usually start in March or April and peak in May. However, they can continue until October each year.

HFMD mostly affects children aged under 10 years. However, adult cases occur, especially in young adults.

HFMD spreads through contact with discharges of infected people.

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. Sometimes serious outbreaks occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* practice good hygiene, including careful and frequent handwashing
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

Seek medical care if you experience severe symptoms from COVID-19. You can contact the [Taiwan Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En) helpline on 1922.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in public hospitals in major cities is good. However, there are often long waiting times.

The medical system can be confusing. Some hospitals have English-speaking private clinics.

Treatment at private clinics and priority care centres is expensive. You may have to pay up-front for medical and dental services, including for emergency care.
