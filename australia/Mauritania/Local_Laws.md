# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for all drug offences can include heavy fines or jail. This includes possessing small amounts of illegal drugs.

#### Other laws

Although Mauritania operates a de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty, under its penal code, the death penalty can apply for treason, murder, blasphemous speech, sacrilegious acts, and same-sex sexual activity between men.

In Mauritania, it's also illegal to:

* engage in same-sex sexual activity between women
* engage in extramarital sex
* take unauthorised photos of military facilities, airports, government buildings or religious buildings
* import non-Islamic religious materials
* preach a non-Islamic religion
* import alcohol, firearms or pork products
* transport any form of alcohol as a private citizen

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Mauritanian Government doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this may limit the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Local customs

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Mauritania. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

Avoid eating, drinking and smoking in public or in front of people who are fasting between sunrise and sunset.

#### Dress standards

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative, particularly for women. Dress modestly in public and ensure your legs are covered. Women should also cover their arms, while men may wear short-sleeved shirts.

Take care not to offend.

#### Showing affection

Avoid physical contact between men and women in public.

Public displays of affection can cause offence, particularly:

* in rural and traditional areas
* near mosques, shrines and religious educational institutions
