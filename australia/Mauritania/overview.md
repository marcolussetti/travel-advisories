## Overview

### Safety

* There is a threat of terrorism in Mauritania, particularly in the eastmost regions. Terrorists could target places visited by foreigners or places connected to the Government of Mauritania. Remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings.
* There's a threat of kidnapping across the Sahel, including in Mauritania. Westerners are at a higher risk of being targeted. If you travel to Mauritania, get professional security advice. Avoid travelling to remote locations. Arrange personal security measures.
* Pay close attention to your safety. Crime, including violent crime, continues to rise.
* Armed burglaries, robberies, and pickpocketing may occur on busy streets in broad daylight. Keep valuables out of sight. Armed thieves often attack people in cars and beach areas. Carjackings by people smugglers may occur. Keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving.
* Fake internet friendships, dating and marriage schemes operate in West African countries. Be wary of requests to send money or travel to Mauritania from someone you met online.
* Women travelling alone may be subject to unwelcome male attention. Take extra precautions.

### Health

* Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance, which cover all medical costs and medical evacuation. Check that your travel insurance policy covers you for travel to Mauritania. You may need a special policy that covers travel to remote or high-risk places.
* Medical and dental facilities are extremely limited, and many medicines are difficult to obtain, particularly outside Nouakchott. If you're seriously ill or injured, there are limited options for medical care in-country, and you may need to be medically evacuated. Make sure your insurance covers this.
* Malaria is a risk year-round in most areas. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Other insect-borne diseases include dengue, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. They include cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties can include heavy fines or prison sentences. This applies even if you have a small amount of drugs.
* Extramarital sex is illegal in Mauritania, even in the case of rape. Women have been detained when reporting rape and sexual assault. They must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged.
* Same-sex sexual activity is illegal.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military sites, airports and government and religious buildings without permission.
* Mauritania has strict religious laws. It's illegal to import non-Islamic religious materials or preach non-Islamic religion.
* Importing alcohol, pork products or firearms is against the law and will attract large fines. It's also illegal for anyone to transport any form of alcohol, unless authorised.
* Dress and behaviour standards are conservative, especially for women. Avoid physical contact between men and women in public. Take care not to offend.

* Carry your yellow fever vaccination certificate. You may need it to enter the country.

* Unexploded landmines near the Western Sahara border can shift in sandstorms. Stay on well-travelled roads.
