#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You must obtain an [electronic visa](https://anrpts.gov.mr/en/visa/requestvisa) before travelling, which you can request from the Mauritanian Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization. You can no longer obtain a visa on arrival. If you have difficulties with your visa application, you can email [contact@anrpts.gov.mr](mailto:contact@anrpts.gov.mr)

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy of Mauritania](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/127) for the latest details.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mauritania. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passports

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen contract the Australian Embassy in Paris.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Mauritanian Ouguiya (MRU). You can't import or export ouguiyas.

You must declare any foreign currency on arrival, but there are no limits on how much you can import.

When you leave Mauritania, you can't have more foreign currency with you than the amount you declared on arrival.

Credit cards aren't widely used. Traveller's cheques aren't accepted. Most places only accept cash.

Some banks in Nouakchott have ATMs which accept foreign credit cards. Check ATM locations with your bank before you travel.

Only exchange currency at official centres and banks. Avoid exchanging money with street hustlers.

#### Local travel

Organise travel with a reputable local company.

If you're travelling beyond Nouakchott, register your plans with the local police or gendarmes.

All travel outside of Nouakchott should be in a convoy with proper security.

Unexploded landmines are a risk near the border with the Western Sahara region. Mines can shift in sandstorms.

If you travel to this area despite our advice, stay on well-travelled roads.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous.

The conditions of paved roads in Mauritania are generally poor, and overland travel is difficult. Use four-wheel drive vehicles, check the tide times on coastal roads, travel in convoys and ensure you have adequate supplies of water and fuel for long journeys. Driving standards can also be poor.

The major roads linking Nouakchott with Nouadhibou to Mali to the west, and Senegal to the south are in good condition.

Most other roads in Mauritania are in poor condition.

Accident risks include:

* poor vehicle maintenance
* poor local driving standards
* animals on roads
* shifting sand dunes

If you plan to drive in Mauritania:

* avoid driving at night
* carry enough food, water and fuel
* make sure your car is roadworthy
* only travel in the desert if you're familiar with the area
* check the credentials and references of desert guides
