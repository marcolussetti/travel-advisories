#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a special insurance policy that covers travel to remote or high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Mauritania.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mauritania. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a year-round risk in most areas, except in the northern regions of Dakhlet-Nouadhibou and Tiris-Zemmour.

Other mosquito-borne diseases include [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) and [Rift Valley fever](https://www.who.int/health-topics/rift-valley-fever#tab=tab_1).

There's no vaccination or specific treatment for dengue.

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is widespread in Mauritania. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated for before you travel.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medication to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common, including:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

#### Medical care

The standard of private medical facilities in Nouakchott is adequate, however, facilities are very limited outside of Nouakchott, and the standard of care of the public system is below that of Australia.

Local public hospitals may not be able to provide ambulance services, and you should research private medical facilities which provide ambulance services before arriving in country.

You'll likely have to pay up-front for medical services.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be medically evacuated to a location with better facilities. Medical evacuations are very expensive. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical evacuations.
