#### Terrorism

The porous nature of the borders in the Sahel region, which Mauritania is a part of, means terrorist groups can operate anywhere in the region. Terrorist attacks may occur in Mauritania.

Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate and could target places visited by foreigners, or places connected to the Government of Mauritania.

Possible targets include:

* beach resorts, clubs, restaurants and hotels
* embassies and consulates
* international schools and expatriate housing
* places of worship
* shopping centres, transport hubs and outdoor events
* foreign interests and businesses

Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Remain vigilant in these locations.

To reduce your risk of being involved in an attack:

* avoid travelling to remote areas
* review your personal security plans. If you plan to travel to a high-risk location, seek professional security advice. You’re responsible for your safety.
* be aware of your surroundings and watch for suspicious activity
* think about the level of security before you visit a location
* stay at hotels that have robust security measures

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

There is a threat of kidnapping across the Sahel region, including in Mauritania. The threat in Mauritania is greatest in the regions bordering Mali and Algeria. Westerners are at a higher risk of being targeted. Foreigners have been kidnapped from remote and desert areas in the Sahel region, and some have been killed. Further kidnappings are likely. Foreigners travelling alone or without security are easy targets.  

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.  

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of large quantities of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* steal money from people they have invited to Africa for a business opportunity

Fake internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes operate from West African countries. These scams usually start via internet dating sites or chat rooms.

In some cases the relationship ends, and your money is gone. In other situations, if you travel to Africa to meet your friend or prospective marriage partner, you may be:

* [kidnapped](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
