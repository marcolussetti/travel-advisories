#### Terrorism

The porous nature of the borders in the Sahel region, which Mauritania is a part of, means terrorist groups can operate anywhere in the region. Terrorist attacks may occur in Mauritania.

Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate and could target places visited by foreigners, or places connected to the Government of Mauritania.

Possible targets include:

* beach resorts, clubs, restaurants and hotels
* embassies and consulates
* international schools and expatriate housing
* places of worship
* shopping centres, transport hubs and outdoor events
* foreign interests and businesses

Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Remain vigilant in these locations.

To reduce your risk of being involved in an attack:

* avoid travelling to remote areas
* review your personal security plans. If you plan to travel to a high-risk location, seek professional security advice. You’re responsible for your safety.
* be aware of your surroundings and watch for suspicious activity
* think about the level of security before you visit a location
* stay at hotels that have robust security measures

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is a risk across Mauritania, with a greater risk closer towards the Mali-Mauritania border and the Sahel region. Foreigners have been kidnapped from remote and desert areas in the Sahel region. Some have been killed. Further kidnappings are likely.

Foreigners travelling alone or without security are easy targets.

Terrorists and criminal groups carry out kidnappings. Criminals sell their victims to terrorist groups.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

To reduce the risk of being kidnapped:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location with them
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

If you decide to travel to the Mali-Mauritania border areas despite our advice:

* vary your daily routines
* avoid locations popular with foreigners
* avoid unnecessary travel in remote areas
* arrange your own personal security measures

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

Incidents of violent and petty crime continue to increase across Mauritania. Carjackings by people smugglers may occur.

Armed thieves have attacked:

* the cinquième (fifth) district in Nouakchott
* beach areas around Nouakchott at night
* deserted beach areas, even during the day
* northern and eastern areas of the country
* cars on roads between Mali and Mauritania
* cars in the north of Mauritania

If you're travelling in Mauritania:

* arrange personal security measures
* keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* avoid walking alone outside, and pay attention to your personal security
* ensure that your belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times

#### Scams and fraud

Commercial and internet fraud often starts in Western African countries, including Mauritania.

If you're a victim of a [scam](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers"), you could lose your money. Victims who travel to the country where the scam started can be in serious danger. People have been killed.

Criminals might:

* ask for details of a bank account to transfer large amounts of money. They may offer a fee or donation
* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of large quantities of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* steal money from people they have invited to Africa for a business opportunity

Fake internet friendship, dating and marriage schemes operate from West African countries. These scams usually start via internet dating sites or chat rooms. Scammers build a virtual relationship with you, then ask for money so they can travel to Australia. People have been defrauded or put in danger.

In some cases the relationship ends, and your money is gone. In other situations, if you travel to Africa to meet your friend or prospective marriage partner, you may be:

* [kidnapped](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* a victim of extortion
* threatened on arrival

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Mauritania to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Local protests and political gatherings take place from time to time, including in Nouakchott.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To reduce your risk during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests, rallies and large public gatherings
* monitor the media and other sources

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") may affect your travel.

Monitor local media for updates.

If you're visiting an area affected by severe weather:

* confirm your plans with your tour operator or travel provider
* check the condition of infrastructure with local operators and hotels
