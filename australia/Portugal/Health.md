#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

You may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care if you're not insured.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including stopovers on the way to your destination)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. Many public hospitals in Portugal are full and under strain.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Portugal. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

You can carry prescription medicines for personal use into Portugal.  If you are unsure about medication and quantities, contact the Portuguese National Drug Authority, [Infarmed](https://www.infarmed.pt/web/infarmed-en/).

To receive medications by post, you may require an import permit.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Portuguese pharmacies usually carry medications similar to those in Australia. They may be a different brand or dosage. You may need a prescription from a local doctor.

#### Health risks

Health risks are broadly similar to those in Australia.

#### Medical care

The Portuguese public health system is experiencing ongoing staffing shortages. You may experience delays in accessing health care services, particularly for non-urgent care.

Large private medical facilities in major cities are comparable to Australia's standards.

The standards of public facilities vary and are generally lower than in Australia, even in major cities. 

Treatment costs are high, especially at private facilities.

You may need to pay before doctors and hospitals treat you.

You may need to confirm insurance or guarantee payment before a private hospital will admit you.
