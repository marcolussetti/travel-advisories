# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Bag snatching, [pickpocketing and theft](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") from cars and accommodation can occur, especially in tourist areas.

Pay particular attention to your belongings at:

* tourist attractions and museums
* railway stations and cruise terminals
* public transport, especially on trams in heavily frequented tourist areas
* bars, nightclubs, restaurants and hotel foyers
* beaches
* accommodation, particularly short-term rentals

Criminals target cruise ship passengers at the terminals. Pay attention to your belongings when leaving cruise ships or transferring to buses and local transport.

To keep your valuables safe:

* keep your passport and other identity documents separate
* use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres, not on the street
* don't leave your bag on the back of the chair or at your feet in restaurants or cafes
* store valuables in a secure location

Put a card with your contact details in your wallet. Tourist police will contact you if someone hands in your lost or stolen property.

#### Theft from vehicles

Thieves target vehicles with foreign licence plates and rental car stickers. 

To protect your belongings in your vehicle:

* keep car doors locked and luggage out of sight at all times
* use a secure parking facility, especially overnight
* don't leave your vehicle unattended for long periods
* avoid hiring cars with rental company stickers.

#### Violent crime

[Robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and assaults on foreigners occur, particularly in Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve area at popular tourist locations and nightclubs/bars. Incidents of pickpocketing and physical assault, including [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), have been reported to the police. 

Drink spiking is also a risk. Don't accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.

To reduce your risk of violent crime:

* avoid walking in quiet and poorly lit streets, especially at night
* monitor the media for updates on safety and security risks

#### Scams and fraud

Don't agree to compensate drivers for alleged damage to their vehicles. Always contact the police.

Be wary of scams relating to ATM cards and the 'MB way' money transfer app.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Strikes and public demonstrations are common. These can cause street congestion, disrupt public services and affect transport services, including buses, trains, metro, ferries and flights.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid crowds, protests and demonstrations
* check local sources for information on possible strikes or unrest
* follow the advice of local authorities
* contact your travel or tour operator about disruptions to travel

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Portugal, they can still happen.

The national terrorism alert for Portugal has been raised from 'moderate' to 'significant' (level 3 out of 5) as a precaution due to the situation in the Middle East and several security incidents in other European countries.

In recent years, terrorists have staged attacks in several European cities.

Targets have included:

* public transport
* transport hubs
* public places popular with foreigners.

European security services have disrupted some planned attacks.

To protect yourself from terrorist threats:

* be alert to possible threats in public places
* exercise caution in locations that could be terrorist targets
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor local news for new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Deaths by drowning occur regularly at Portuguese beaches, including riverside beaches, and in swimming pools. If you disobey lifeguard warnings or flags, you could be fined.

Take coloured warning flags on beaches seriously:

* red - danger, don't enter the water
* yellow - you may paddle at the water's edge but not swim
* green flag - safe to swim
* chequered - lifeguards not present

Seas can be rough, particularly during the winter months. Beaches aren't patrolled during this period. Exercise caution if entering the water. 

Pay attention to signs about cliff erosion. Remain behind the barriers at viewing spots. Falling rocks are a hazard, particularly in the Algarve. You can be fined if you ignore warning signs.

Follow local advice if jellyfish are present, as they can cause serious injury.

Never leave belongings unattended on the beach or in vehicles parked at beach car parks.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Portugal experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including earthquakes, fires and localised flooding.

During a natural disaster or severe weather, monitor the media and other sources, such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/), and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Earthquakes

Portugal is in an active earthquake zone and experiences regular [seismic activity,](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")particularly on the islands of the Azores. Low-scale tremors are often registered in Lisbon, including the greater Lisbon area and the south-west coastal region of mainland Portugal.

#### Bushfires and forest fires

High temperatures and bushfires are common in the warmer months, including near coastal and tourist areas.

Large forest fires have caused many deaths and injuries in recent years. In addition to the immediate risk posed by forest fires, the smoke produced may affect those with sensitive respiratory systems. 

Forest fires can disrupt public transportation, rail and road networks.

Causing a bushfire is an offence, even if it's an accident.

#### Localised flooding

Localised flooding can occur in Portugal during winter, particularly in urban areas. Exercise caution around affected areas, and don't attempt to cross flooded areas.
