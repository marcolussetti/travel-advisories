#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Portugal is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This allows you to enter Portugal without a visa in some circumstances. In other situations, you'll need a visa.

Get a clear entry stamp on your passport when you first enter the Schengen area, including Portugal.

Airlines might refuse boarding if you don't have proof of entry or have overstayed your Schengen visa.

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the Schengen area.

Portugal's Visa and Immigration Agency ([AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos)) is working through a substantial backlog of residence permit and long-stay visa applications, and lengthy processing delays are common. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Portugal or [AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos) for the latest details or seek advice from a local lawyer.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements, contact:

* [Customs when entering and leaving Portugal](https://www.lisbonairport.pt/en/lis/passenger-guide/plan-your-trip/customs)
* the [Portuguese Immigration and Border Service](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos)
* an [embassy or consulate of Portugal](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/163)

#### Entry into Portugal

If you plan on entering Portugal on a non-Australian passport, consult that country's website, embassy or consulate.

If you're arriving from a non-European Union country, you may be subject to longer than expected delays for entry processing, particularly at Lisbon airport.

Check the requirements for [arriving](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/sobre-portugal/info-util) in Portugal, including the islands of [Madeira](https://visitmadeira.com/en/contacts/) and the [Azores](https://www.visitazores.com/en/contacts). 

Portuguese Government websites, including the official Tourism Agency ([Visit Portugal](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/sobre-portugal/info-util)), Visa and Immigration Agency ([AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos)) and COVID response ('[Estamos On'](https://covid19estamoson.gov.pt/levantamento-de-restricoes-covid-19/)), particularly English-language versions, are often out of date or inaccurate. [Contact the embassy or consulate of Portugal for current information](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/163).

#### Travelling with children

Under Portuguese law, foreign minors under 18 years of age entering or exiting Portugal must have an authorisation letter of parental consent to travel if travelling without their parent/s or legal guardian/s. Check the [legal requirements](https://eportugal.gov.pt/en/cidadaos-europeus-viajar-viver-e-fazer-negocios-em-portugal/viajar-para-portugal) for a letter.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Portugal](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/163) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Carry copies of the photograph page of your passport in case you're stopped by local authorities.

#### Lost or stolen passports

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible and obtain a local police report.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the euro (EUR).

Declare amounts over 10,000 euros or the same amount in another foreign currency. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

This applies if you're travelling between Portugal and any non-European Union country. You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling to or from another European Union country.

You'll be fined if you don't declare or give incorrect information.

Foreign bank cards may not be accepted in smaller shops, restaurants, towns or rural areas. You can use Australian credit cards at larger hotels and shopping centres.

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen area](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/schengen).

Check border conditions through local news sources and transport providers.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Portugal using a valid Australian driver's licence. 

Local authorities and car rental companies require the presentation of an original driver licence.  Australian digital driver licences are not accepted in Portugal. 

If you hold a residence permit for Portugal, you can continue to use your valid Australian driver's license as long as you meet certain [conditions](https://eportugal.gov.pt/en/servicos/trocar-carta-de-conducao-estrangeira-por-portuguesa#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20drive,data%20will%20also%20be%20collected.).

#### Road travel

Portugal has a high rate of motor vehicle accidents and road fatalities.

Dangers include:

* unpredictable local driving habits
* driving under the influence of substances
* vehicles travelling at excessive speed on motorways
* poorly marked secondary roads and narrow cobblestone streets
* blind corners
* poor lighting
* livestock in rural areas, including in the Azores

Occasional rock falls occur on regional coastal roads.

You must report traffic accidents to the police.

There are large on-the-spot fines for:

* drink-driving
* speeding
* using a mobile phone while driving

E-scooters are an increasingly popular mode of transport, particularly in major cities. The number of incidences involving e-scooters is on the rise. Wear a helmet and be alert to the road traffic around you.

#### Taxis

Taxis are usually reliable. However, there are reports of taxi drivers overcharging, threatening and harassing passengers at Lisbon airport. There are no fixed taxi transfer fees at airports.  Confirm the approximate cost of the fare to your destination before your trip begins and check with the driver what payment methods are accepted.

Ride-sharing services are available and legal.

Official taxis are usually identifiable as black and green. 

To stay safe in taxis:

* ask the taxi driver to use the meter
* ask for a receipt, which taxi drivers must provide if requested

There are no taxi meters in the Azores. Confirm the fare before your trip starts.

#### Tuk-tuks

Tuk-tuks are common in popular tourist areas.

Check your insurance covers you in the event of an accident in a tuk-tuk.

Always use a seatbelt.

Thieves may try to snatch your possessions when travelling by tuk-tuk, particularly in tourist areas.

#### Public transport

Public transport is usually safe and reliable.

You can top up rechargeable tickets at metro and train stations. Use these tickets on most public buses, ferries, trams, trains and the metro.

Strikes and public demonstrations are common. These can cause street congestion and affect transport services, including buses, trains, metro, ferries and flights.

#### Sea travel

If you arrive via sea, including on a [cruise](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/144), visa and other entry requirements, including Schengen, apply. This applies regardless of how long you stay. See the information on visas above. 

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Portugal's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=CS) with the Aviation Safety Network.
