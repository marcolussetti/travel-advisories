# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Judicial procedures can be lengthy and are often subject to delays. Seek advice from a local lawyer or [Portugal's Victims of Crime support unit](https://apav.pt/mihy/) (APAV).

#### Drugs

Possession and use of illegal drugs are administrative offences and can attract large fines.

Selling or trafficking illegal drugs is a criminal offence. Penalties are severe and can include jail sentences.

#### Gambling

Gambling is legal in venues licensed by the government, such as official casinos.

Gambling is illegal in unlicensed venues. Organisers, players and anyone on the premises may be charged, fined or jailed.

Check you're entering a licensed gambling venue.

#### Inappropriate behaviour in public places

A [Code of Conduct](https://www.cm-albufeira.pt/sites/default/files/RepositorioPublicacoes/2025/cma-regrascomp-regras13jun2025.pdf) has been introduced in the municipality of Albufeira, in the Algarve, banning inappropriate behaviour in public places. Be aware of the rules and avoid on the spot fines ranging between €150 and €1,800.

#### Other laws

You must carry photo ID in Portugal.

You can be fined if you ride an e-scooter or e-bike under the influence of alcohol.

You may be required to pay IVA (VAT/GST) and/or customs fees to receive international parcels via mail in Portugal, including online shopping and gifts. Fees may seem high relative to the value of goods, and you may be asked to attend a customs facility or pay an agent to release goods.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
