## Overview

### Safety

* Portugal's national terrorism alert is 'significant' (level 3 out of 5). Always be alert to terrorism. Terrorists have targeted European cities, including transport hubs and places visited by travellers. Take official warnings seriously.
* [Strikes and public demonstrations](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest") are common. They can cause street congestion, disrupt public services, and affect transport services, including buses, trains, metro, ferries and flights. Most demonstrations are peaceful but could become violent. Avoid demonstrations and public protests, monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Bag snatching, pickpocketing and theft from cars and accommodation occur. Keep valuables out of sight. Pay attention to your belongings at beaches, tourist spots, accommodation and public transport. Ensure valuable items are stored in a secure place. Incidents of physical assault associated with pickpocketing have been reported to the police. Violent crimes, such as robberies and assaults, including [sexual assaults](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/resources/sexual-assault-overseas-factsheet), happen. Drink spiking is also a risk. Don't accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended.
* People have drowned at Portuguese beaches and in rivers. Obey lifeguard warnings. A red flag means 'danger, don't enter the water'. Pay attention to signs about cliff erosion.
* High temperatures and bushfires regularly impact mainland Portugal during the summer months. Localised flooding can occur during the winter months, particularly in cities. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* If you need urgent medical assistance, call 112.
* The Portuguese health system is experiencing ongoing staffing shortages and strikes. You may experience delays in accessing public health care services, particularly for non-urgent care.
* Large private medical facilities in major cities are comparable to Australia's standards. Standards in public facilities and rural areas vary but are generally of a lower standard than in Australia.
* Private medical facilities provide good quality care but may require payment upfront. Medical treatment is expensive. There is no reciprocal health care agreement between Australia and Portugal.

### Local laws

* Judicial procedures can be lengthy and are often subject to delays. Seek advice from a local lawyer or [Portugal's Victims of Crime support unit](https://apav.pt/mihy/) (APAV).

* Portugal's Visa and Immigration Agency ([AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos)) is working through a substantial backlog of residence permit and long-stay visa applications, and lengthy processing delays are common. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Portugal or [AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt/contactos) for the latest details or seek advice from a local lawyer.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Portugal](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/163) for the latest details.
