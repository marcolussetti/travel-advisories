## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist attacks could happen at any time, including in locations popular with foreigners and tourists.
* The US Embassy in Tanzania has issued a [security alert](https://tz.usembassy.gov/security-alert-u-s-embassy-dar-es-salaam-tanzania-march-21-2025/) advising avoiding all travel to islands and coastal areas south of Kisiju. Be alert to your surroundings and pay close attention to your personal security.
* During the rainy seasons (March to May and November to December), floods can block roads. Monsoons occur in coastal and island areas from July to October. Cyclones in coastal areas are also common. Follow the advice of local officials.
* Violent armed robbery, petty theft and threats of violence are common, especially in Dar es Salaam. Be extra careful in and around Arusha in northern Tanzania. Armed robberies, carjackings and home invasions have occurred. Bag snatching from moving vehicles is increasing. Victims can be injured or killed by being dragged behind vehicles. Don't resist bag-snatch attempts.
* Only use registered taxis. Travellers have been targeted by criminals while using unlicensed taxis.
* Security incidents continue along the Tanzania-Mozambique border. In October 2020, a violent attack occurred in Kitaya village, in Mtwara, close to the border with Mozambique. Do not travel within 30km of the border with Mozambique in the Mtwara region.

### Health

* There's currently an outbreak of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* Malaria, including chloroquine-resistant strains, occurs year-round, except in areas above 1800 metres. You should take anti-malarial medication.
* Yellow fever can occur. Check with a health professional before travelling if you need to get vaccinated. Other insect-borne diseases include Zika virus, dengue, filariasis and East African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof and use insect repellent.

* Altitude sickness can affect anyone at heights over 2500 metres. If you plan to climb Mt Kilimanjaro (5895 metres), make sure you're physically fit and in good health. Talk to your doctor before you travel.
* Medical facilities and medications are limited. If you get injured or become ill, you may need to be evacuated to another country for treatment. This can be expensive. Check that this is covered by your travel insurance. In case of a medical emergency, call the toll-free Health Emergency Number: 112.
