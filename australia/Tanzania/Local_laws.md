# Local laws

#### Local law

While in Tanzania, you're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Pornography

It's illegal to possess or access pornographic material.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Same-sex activity is illegal. Authorities can jail you for up to 30 years. Authorities might subject you to an invasive examination.

In June 2017, the Tanzanian Government announced a crackdown on LGBTQIA+ rights advocates in Tanzania.

In September 2017, authorities arrested 20 people in Zanzibar while they were receiving training about HIV/AIDS prevention.

The Regional Commissioner of Dar es Salaam has formed a surveillance team to identify suspected LGBTQIA+ people.

Members of the LGBTQIA+ community and advocates can be targets for harassment. There are regular cases of harassment and arrests by authorities and intimidation by members of the public. LGBTQIA+ travellers should take precautions.

#### Dual citizenship

Tanzania doesn't recognise dual nationality.

This limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services) we can give if you're a Tanzanian dual national and arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
