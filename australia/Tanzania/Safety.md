# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could happen at any time, and may target locations popular with foreigners and tourists, including:

* hotels, restaurants, bars and clubs
* embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic interests
* schools
* places of worship
* shopping malls, markets and outdoor events
* transport hubs and public transport
* large gatherings like sporting or religious events
* police stations

Attacks have continued intermittently along the Tanzania-Mozambique border. In October 2020, a violent attack occurred in Kitaya village, in Mtwara, close to the border with Mozambique. Terrorists have targeted the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique adjacent to the Tanzania border area. Avoid travelling to within 30km of the border with Mozambique, in the Mtwara region, due to the threat of militant attacks, terrorism and kidnappings.

To protect yourself from terrorism, you should:

* be alert to your surroundings
* pay close attention to your personal security
* consider the level of security at places you visit
* stay alert in crowded places and locations frequented by foreigners
* keep a low profile
* monitor local media

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Violent [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), petty theft and threats of violence are common in Tanzania, especially in Dar es Salaam.

Travellers have been [sexually assaulted](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault). HIV/AIDS is widespread in Tanzania. If you're a victim of rape or violent crime, seek immediate medical attention.

Criminals in Dar es Salaam are becoming bolder and crime is more common. There are regular reports of crime along the Toure Drive on the Msasani Peninsula, especially bag snatching from moving vehicles.

Serious injury and death after resisting bag snatching is possible. Victims have been dragged behind vehicles. Don't resist or try to stop bag snatch attempts.

Take extra care in and around Arusha in northern Tanzania. Armed robberies, carjackings and home invasions have happened.

Don't accept food or drink from strangers — it may be spiked.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* take care on public transport, in shared taxis and at bus stations
* take care at places frequented by travellers, including national parks and beaches
* avoid walking and travelling after dark

Thieves target travellers in isolated and coastal areas. ​

'[Express kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")' occurs. Kidnappers abduct people and force them to withdraw funds from ATMs before releasing them. This can happen after being befriended by strangers or while using unlicensed taxis. Only use registered taxis.

If you're stopped by police, ask to see their ID, especially before paying fines.

#### Border areas

There are bandits near refugee camps in Kigoma, towards Kagera and near the borders of Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Do not travel within 30km of the border with Mozambique in the Mtwara region. Terrorists are likely to target foreigners and foreign interests. The insurgency poses an extreme threat in neighbouring Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique, and attacks are highly likely to continue. Read the [Mozambique travel advice](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/mozambique) for more information.

In August 2021, the South African Development Community (SADC) deployed military forces to Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. Terrorist organisations may increase operations in the Mtwara region as it may be outside the current reach of SADC operations. 

The US Embassy and the United Nations recommend that you use police escorts on parts of the Rusomo to Kahama Road near the border with Rwanda. There's a threat of armed attacks.

Pay attention to your personal security when visiting national parks, game parks and reserves.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

There’s a risk of kidnapping in the Mtwari region. Terrorists are likely to target foreigners and foreign interests. 

Express kidnappings occur, including in Dar es Salaam. Criminals may kidnap you from the street or a taxi and force you to withdraw money from ATMs. This can happen after being befriended by strangers or while using unlicensed taxis. Only use registered taxis.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* don’t display money or valuables in public
* use ATMs inside banks, hotels and shopping centres and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services or ride-sharing apps

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Be alert in public places. Avoid locations without an obvious security presence.

Avoid large gatherings or demonstrations. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Monitor the media and other sources for safety information.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as diving.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Wildlife safety

Follow local wildlife laws. Keep a safe and legal distance when looking at animals. This includes marine animals and birds.

Only use reputable and professional guides or tour operators.

Follow park rules and the advice of wardens.

Don't swim in lakes and rivers. You could be attacked by wildlife. There's also a risk of catching waterborne diseases.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Tanzania experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), such as:

* [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather "Severe weather")
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [cyclones](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

If a natural disaster happens, follow the advice of local authorities.

Register for updates from the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/).

#### Flooding

The rainy seasons in Tanzania are from March to May and November to December. Unusual weather patterns may mean the rainy season is delayed or extended.

[Floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") may close roads.

Monsoons occur in coastal areas and on islands, between June and October.

#### Earthquakes

Tanzania lies on a fault line, so earthquakes are possible and can cause signifcant damage.

Get to know the [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) safety measures for each place you stay or visit.

#### Tsunamis

All oceanic regions can experience tsunamis. In the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the risk is higher. There are many large earthquakes along major tectonic plate boundaries and ocean trenches in this region.

#### Cyclones

Cyclones can happen along coastal areas. The direction and strength of cyclones can change with little warning.

If there's a cyclone or severe storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* ferries may stop running (to and from Zanzibar)
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* flights out may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available

Severe weather may also affect:

* access to ports
* road travel and bridges
* essential services, such as water and electricity
