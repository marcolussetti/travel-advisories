#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Tanzania. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medical care

There are limited medical facilities and medications are often not available, even in major cities.

If you have an accident or become ill, you may need to be evacuated by air to Kenya or another country. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

#### Health risks

#### Mpox

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Tanzania.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

You'll need to pass through mpox screening, including body temperature checks, at all points of entry into Tanzania.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is found throughout the year, except in areas above 1800 metres. Chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria have been reported.

Other insect-borne diseases occur. These include:

* [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever)
* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trypanosomiasis-human-african-(sleeping-sickness))

The tsetse fly carries sleeping sickness. This is common to the northern safari area of Tanzania.

To protect yourself from disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* insect-proof your accommodation
* consider taking medication to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is widespread. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. Serious outbreaks happen. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/health-topics/measles#tab=tab_1)
* [meningococcal disease](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningococcal-meningitis)
* [Rift Valley virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rift-valley-fever)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* don't eat raw or undercooked food, such as salads
* don't touch domestic animals
* don't swim in fresh water

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Altitude sickness

If you plan to climb Mt Kilimanjaro (5895m) make sure you're physically fit and in good health. Be aware of altitude sickness.

If you rapidly climb to altitudes greater than 2500m, you can get altitude sickness. This can be life-threatening and affect anyone, even if you're physically fit.

People who are more at risk of altitude sickness are those who:

* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before adjusting to the change in altitude
* have health problems that affect breathing

If you're planning to visit high altitudes areas, check with your doctor before you go.

Make sure your insurance policy covers you.
