#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Tanzania.  Apply [online](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) before travelling.

It's possible to get some single-entry visas on arrival in Tanzania at the main points of entry, if you meet all the requirements for entry. You may also be required to provide proof of your return journey.

From 1 October 2024, to travel to Zanzibar you must buy inbound travel insurance for up to 92 days from the Zanzibar Insurance Corporation. There are limits to what is covered by this insurance. Make sure you also maintain separate travel insurance.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Tanzania](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/195) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules and the online visa application form.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

Proof of yellow fever vaccination may be required for entry to Tanzania if arriving from or transiting through a yellow fever risk country. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to [Australia after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) and see the World Health Organization's advice on [countries with a risk of yellow fever.](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/travel-and-health/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission.pdf?sfvrsn=bf42ac59_1&download=true)

#### Border measures

If you intend to travel to Tanzania, confirm entry requirements with Tanzanian authorities prior to making any travel arrangements. Refer to the latest requirements on the [Ministry of Health’s website](https://www.moh.go.tz/index.php). 

You'll need to pass through mpox screening, including body temperature checks, at all points of entry into Tanzania.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The Tanzanian currency is the Tanzanian Shiling (TZS).

Credit card fraud can occur in Tanzania. Always keep your credit card in sight during transactions.

Avoid using ATMs on the street. Use ATMs in banks, shops, hotels and shopping centres.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Driving can be hazardous, especially at night.

Most roads and vehicles are in poor condition.

High speeds, poor driving and bad lighting are all road risks.

Accidents are common and deaths happen.

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in Tanzania than in Australia.

#### Other transport

The electric train service between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro is regular and reliable. Maintenance standards are low for trains on all other lines. Seek local advice for any long-distance train travel.

Use only well-maintained transport and taxis. This includes long-distance buses.

[Ferries](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel)can be overloaded or unseaworthy. There have been 2 major incidents in recent years with many deaths.

Don't board any vessel that's overloaded or in bad condition.

#### Piracy

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") happens off the coast of Tanzania.

Somali pirates attack shipping vessels up to 1000 nautical miles (1852km) from the coast of Somalia.

All ships, cruise liners and commercial vessels are targets for Somali pirates. Many attacks and [kidnappings](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") have happened off the Tanzanian coast.

Be alert and exercise extreme caution anywhere in coastal waters. Don't leave sight of the coastline.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

The European Union (EU) publishes a list of airlines that have operating bans or restrictions within the EU. See the [EU list of banned airlines](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-safety-list_en).

Australian travellers should make their own decisions on which airlines to travel with.

Check Tanzania's air safety profile with the [Aviation Safety Network](https://asn.flightsafety.org/database/country/country.php?id=5H).
