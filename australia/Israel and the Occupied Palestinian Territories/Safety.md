#### Security situation

#### Overall security situation

We continue to advise reconsider your need to travel to Israel overall due to the volatile security situation, armed conflict, civil unrest and terrorism. We continue to advise do not travel to Gaza, border areas with Gaza, border areas with Lebanon, and the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) due to the volatile security situation.

There continues to be a high threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region. Rockets, missiles and drones have been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Syria. There have also been terror attacks on civilians. Follow directions to seek shelter and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only).

Military attacks may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations, diversions and other travel disruptions. Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport may pause operations due to heightened security concerns at any time and at short notice. This may cause flight delays or cancellations. Check with your airline or travel provider for the latest updates before travelling. GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Israel, affecting navigational apps and devices.

#### Gaza conflict

Since October 2023, Israeli Defense Forces have been conducting major operations, including in and around Gaza. Military operations have been suspended in Gaza since 19 January 2025 as a result of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas but may resume in the event the agreement collapses. The risk of Israeli air strikes and land-based IDF operations remains, as does the threat of civil unrest, shooting, rocket and drone attacks. Rockets can land in both Gaza and Israel.

Our ability to provide consular assistance in Gaza is extremely limited. If you're in Gaza, be aware of your surroundings and review your personal security plans. Monitor local media (including social media), UN alerts, and your own organisation's security contacts for information about changing security conditions and alerts to seek shelter.

If you're stuck in military action or civil unrest, stay in a safe place indoors. Monitor the media for updates.

Ordinarily, the Australian Government can't support individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. During the current crisis, our ability to support Australians and their families to leave is extremely limited. 

#### Waters off Gaza

Israel has a naval blockade in place. The Israeli Navy patrols territorial waters and the shared water border zone.

We advise Australians to reconsider participating in any humanitarian flotilla to deliver aid to Gaza. Don't join others seeking to break the naval blockade.

People have previously tried to break the naval blockade along the coast of Gaza. Their actions caused injury, death, arrest and deportation of foreigners, including Australians.

#### Military operations

During military operations, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) may declare an area a closed military zone.

If authorities find civilians in this zone, they can arrest, detain or deport them.

In Israel, local city government websites have lists of public bomb shelters and other emergency information.

The IDF Home Front Command is responsible for managing emergencies, including planning and advising on how to deal with rocket attacks. In an emergency, a message will be sent to all local mobile phones in the area with details of the event and safety instructions. You can also contact the Home Front Command on 104 (the hotline has English-speaking operators, option 5). Authorities may also establish a National Emergency Portal website for specific events.

#### West Bank

We continue to advise do not travel to the West Bank due to the volatile security situation.

The security situation in the West Bank is unpredictable, with continuing tensions and violence between Israelis and Palestinians. There's an armed conflict in and around Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas.

Israeli settler violence occurs in parts of the West Bank. Stone-throwing around Israeli settlements and military checkpoints is common.

Don't enter closed military zones, even where these have been in place for a long time, such as the old city of Hebron.

Israeli authorities may open temporary additional checkpoints in the West Bank or close crossings to the West Bank on local holidays or due to security incidents.

Israeli security/military operations occur in the West Bank. There's been an increase in Israeli security operations in the northern West Bank since January, including intensive operations in refugee camps. If you're in the West Bank during Israeli military action, stay in a safe place indoors, away from windows. Monitor the media for information.

Authorities impose strict security measures after terrorist attacks. These may severely affect the movement of Palestinians, including Australian dual nationals.

#### Israel's borders with neighbouring states

Cross-border political tensions and unrest create security risks for regions of Israel close to its borders with Egypt, Lebanon and Syria.

#### Israel and Lebanon border

We continue to advise do not travel to border areas with Lebanon. These have been closed by Israeli authorities. Authorities are monitoring security on Israel's northern border. Some residents have been advised to evacuate by local authorities.

There's an ongoing threat of rocket attacks, infiltration attempts, revenge fire and other activity along the border between Israel and Lebanon. This area is known as the 'Blue Line'.

There's a significant military presence in the area. The security situation could get worse without notice.

Tensions have remained high between Hezbollah and Israel since the ceasefire of November 2024, and the security situation remains volatile and unpredictable. Further conflict is possible. A resumption of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah would significantly increase risks to your safety and security.

#### Israel and Egypt border

There have been security incidents in the southern city of Eilat and the surrounding area near the Gulf of Aqaba. This includes the border crossing with Egypt near Eilat. There have been deaths and injuries.

**More information:**

* [Travel advice for Egypt](/destinations/africa/egypt "Egypt")

#### Israel and Syria border

We continue to advise against travel to border areas with Syria. Clashes between armed militant groups and the IDF have occurred along the Israeli-Syrian border, including rockets being fired towards Israeli-controlled territory. The risk of violence in this area remains high, and attacks could occur with little or no warning. Kidnapping has been known to happen near the border.

Parts of Route 98 have been closed in the past due to fighting on the Syrian side of the border.

The situation remains tense, and further violence is possible. We recommend avoiding all parts of the Golan Heights to the east of Route 98.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Don't go near demonstrations or large gatherings.

Check the media and other sources for information about planned and possible unrest.

Demonstrations could happen anywhere. They're most likely in and around checkpoints, to/from the West Bank and in and around the Old City in Jerusalem.

Violence can happen at checkpoints, and there are few options to leave the area.

Avoid traffic blockages at checkpoints.

There are regular attacks on vehicles driven on the Sabbath. This happens in and around ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods ( see 'Local laws').

Increased tensions can occur around religious and commemoration events and following political developments, particularly in and around the Old City in Jerusalem. Tensions have resulted in demonstrations and violence in some cities. There have also been rockets fired at targets across Israel and Gaza.

There's a chance of civil unrest in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. International events and political developments may lead to protests and demonstrations, which can be unpredictable and may turn violent. Be alert, avoid demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media for the latest updates.

#### Keeping safe during unrest

To stay safe during civil unrest, avoid demonstrations, political rallies and large public gatherings.

Check the news and other sources for information on unrest or strikes. Plan your activities to stay away from those areas.

Be extra careful during Jewish and Muslim religious holidays, including Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Pesach and Ramadan.

Stay away from traffic congestion at checkpoints.

Know the emergency procedures in each place you stay. Know what to do when air raid sirens sound and where the closest emergency shelters are.

If you're caught in military action or civil unrest, follow the instructions of local authorities.

Unless told otherwise, stay indoors and monitor the media.

Be prepared to change your travel plans.

If civil unrest affects transport services, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Terrorism

Israel continues to be a target of terrorist attacks.

Local and international political developments and events may lead to terrorist attacks.

Attacks could happen anywhere, at any time, including by lone actors.

Terrorists have attacked buses, public transport hubs and tourist areas. These include in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Attacks have included shootings, stabbings, vehicle ramming and bombings.

Be alert to possible threats, especially:

* at tourist locations, religious sites and crowded public places
* near police checkpoints
* in regions bordering [Egypt](/destinations/africa/egypt "Egypt"), [Syria](/destinations/middle-east/syria "Syria") and [Lebanon](/destinations/middle-east/lebanon "Lebanon")

Australian Government officials are advised only to use public transport services in Israel and the West Bank, which include security screening of passengers and luggage. This is because of safety and security concerns and doesn't apply to taxis.

Militant and terror groups operate in regions of Egypt, Syria and Lebanon that are close to Israel, making travel close to borders with those countries dangerous.

When planning your activities, reconsider going to places known to be terrorist targets. Consider the level of security provided.

Take care when travelling to a region where there are terrorists or somewhere that terrorists could target. Have an exit plan in case there's a security incident.

To stay safe:

* consider avoiding public transport other than taxis
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police
* regularly check local and international media for news about any new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Foreigners have been kidnapped in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  
  
Always be alert to your personal security and surroundings, particularly in the Gaza area.  
  
The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

**More information:**

* [Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")

#### Crime

Violent crime, other than terrorism and politically motivated violence, is rare.

Purse snatching, pickpocketing and petty theft can happen.

Theft from vehicles may happen, especially in beachside areas.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

**More information:**

* [Cyber security when travelling overseas](/before-you-go/staying-safe/cyber-security "Cyber security when travelling overseas")

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if it's covered by your travel insurance policy
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Israel, the West Bank and Gaza are in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone.

Flash floods can happen in the Judean Hills and Negev desert in the winter months from November to March.

Sandstorms, dust storms and bushfires happen during the warmer months.

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"):

* secure your passport in a safe location
* stay in contact with friends and family
* monitor local media and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
