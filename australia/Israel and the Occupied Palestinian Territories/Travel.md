#### Flight and road routes out of Israel

#### Flights

Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport may close or pause operations due to heightened security concerns at any time, and at short notice. This may cause flight delays or cancellations. Check with your airline for the latest updates before travelling.

#### Land border crossings

You should depart Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories when it’s safe to do so. The Australian Government can't offer advice on the safety of travelling to departure points. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk. Make contingency plans to leave when it's safe to do so. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

Land border crossings to Jordan may open and close at short notice. Before you travel, check [Jordanian Border Crossings](https://www.accesscoordination.org/CrossingJordanC19%20-%20view.aspx) for regular opening times and also check the latest public information from local authorities in Israel and Jordan to make sure border crossings are open.

There are 2 land border crossings between Israel and Jordan: Sheikh Hussein/Jordan River near Irbid and Wadi Araba near Aqaba. Additionally, one land border crossing from Israel to Jordan goes through the West Bank: Allenby Bridge/King Hussein near Amman. You'll need a visa to enter Jordan. See our [Jordan Travel Advice](/destinations/middle-east/jordan "Jordan").

The land border crossing between Israel and Egypt: Taba border crossing (Menachem Begin Crossing) is open. To avoid long wait times at the border, you should pay for the Israeli [crossing fee online](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fborderpay.metropolinet.co.il%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C78d6b4d527f341f21f2708ddaef96f26%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638859108519591432%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=CAoGYuaeKpTXXjeUn2Yh8llrQyHO9zanyzs8a%2Bk1cFo%3D&reserved=0) before you arrive. You'll need to pay for a tourist visa and a land border entry fee for entry to Egypt. For the visa, you must have a non-Egyptian credit card or US dollars in cash. For the land border entry fee (payable in Egyptian pounds) an ATM is available in the terminal. See our [Egypt Travel Advice](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fdestinations%2Fafrica%2Fegypt&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C78d6b4d527f341f21f2708ddaef96f26%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638859108519614137%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hQOL2hS0FtLWiMMsOldDHdowMDEO2UcPzgi3qA9tMvw%3D&reserved=0).

Transport routes may be disrupted. Roads may be crowded and exposed to military action or have damage, including to bridges and facilities. Use your judgement to decide the best time and safest means of exit.

Plan for delays at land border crossings. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Make sure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication.

#### Gaza

The security situation in Gaza is unpredictable and dangerous.

Exiting Gaza is extremely difficult.

There are only 2 land crossings for pedestrians into and out of Gaza. Israel controls Erez. Egypt controls Rafah.

You may not be able to leave Gaza even if you have a valid exit permit.

The ability of the Australian Government to help is extremely limited.

#### Erez crossing

Israeli authorities control the Erez crossing into northern Gaza from Israel. The crossing has been closed since October 2023.

#### Rafah crossing

The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods. It's been closed for a significant period due to the Gaza conflict and can be subject to attacks, including air strikes. Access may be restricted for long periods. This can change at short notice.

#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Israel has changed its entry requirements.

All foreigners visiting Israel, including Australians, must obtain either an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA-IL) or a visa before arriving in Israel.

If you plan to visit Israel for less than 90 days, you may be eligible for the ETA-IL. Otherwise, you will need to get a visa before you travel.

ETA-ILs are valid for 2 years or until your current passport expires, whichever comes first. This means that if you receive an ETA-IL approval to travel, you should not have to reapply during the approval period.

To check your eligibility and to apply for the ETA-IL, visit the [ETA-IL website](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/).

Failing to obtain an entry permit may result in a refusal of entry by Israeli border authorities.

The Australian Government can't intervene on your behalf, and our ability to provide consular assistance in these circumstances may be limited.

#### Entry to the West Bank

Israel introduced requirements for foreign nationals entering and residing in the West Bank in October 2022. Further information and contact details for enquiries can be found on the Israeli government [website](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/policies/judeaentry2022).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, security checks, currency, customs and quarantine regulations:

* check the [Israel Government Portal](https://www.gov.il/en)
* contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Israel](https://embassies.gov.il/Pages/IsraeliMissionsAroundTheWorld.aspx)
* [Embassy of Israel in Australia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/96)

#### Other formalities

Israeli authorities can subject you to a security and police record check if you're entering Israel, Gaza or the West Bank.

Authorities may refuse you entry or exit without a reason.

Security officials may question you at length. They may also conduct an intensive search of your bags and person when you arrive and depart.

If you're travelling to protest against Israeli policies, authorities may refuse you entry. You'll be returned to the country where you boarded, including if you've arrive by boat.

Authorities can deny you entry if you have association with, or belong to, an organisation that has called for a boycott of Israel or Israeli settlements.

We can't intervene if you don't meet entry or exit requirements.

#### Entry card

You'll get an entry card instead of an entry stamp on arrival in Israel.

Keep this card with your passport until you leave. The card is evidence of your legal entry into Israel. Authorities may ask for it during your stay.

If you plan to travel to other countries after Israel, read the [travel advice](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained) for each country. Some countries may refuse you entry if:

* your passport shows you have travelled to Israel
* your luggage or possessions show you've been to Israel

#### Travel restrictions

Travel restrictions may apply to some visitors in Israel and the West Bank. There's no clear information about who may be restricted.

Airport officials may ask you to sign a form that stops you entering the West Bank.

In these situations, the Australian Embassy has limited ability to step in.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan toleave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Israel's currency is the Israeli Shekel (ILS). The ILS is also used in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

You can change Australian dollars to shekels in major centres.

ATMs are widely available.

When arriving or leaving Israel, you must declare amounts of $US10,000 or more, or the equivalent in another currency. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare your currency on entry or exit from Israel, authorities could arrest or fine you.

#### Local travel

When deciding on travel around Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, consider the general security situation.

Also consider specific risks to your safety and security in different places.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Israel for up to one year with a valid Australian driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Land border crossings may be closed with short notice and for an unknown period. Before travel, check Israeli government websites and the website of the country you're travelling to to determine if border crossings are open.

Security checkpoints may be set up or closed at any time. This often happens without warning throughout Israel and the West Bank.

You could face delays or trouble passing through checkpoints.

GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Israel, disrupting navigational apps.

Driving can be dangerous.

Hazards include:

* Aggressive drivers who ignore road rules
* Drivers driving while distracted
* Poor road conditions in some parts of the country

Road accidents occur often.

Israeli car insurance does not usually cover travel into Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank. This includes Bethlehem, Jericho and Ramallah.

Separate insurance can be arranged for travel to these places.

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when travelling by motorbike.

Only ride a motorcycle if you're:

* properly licensed
* familiar and comfortable with local driving conditions

By law, you and your passenger must wear a helmet when riding a motorbike.

#### Taxis

Taxis are generally safe and reliable in Israel.

#### Public transport

Take care when using [public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport).

Due to safety and security concerns, Australian government officials and their families are advised to use public transport services in Israel and the West Bank that include security screening of passengers and luggage. This doesn't apply to taxis.

#### Sea travel

Don't travel by sea to the coast of Gaza (see '[Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/205/revisions/view/60063/60108/visual_inline#safety)').

#### Air travel

Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport may pause operations due to heightened security concerns at any time and at short notice. This may cause flight delays or cancellations. Check with your airline for the latest updates before travelling.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Israel's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=4X) with the Aviation Safety Network.
