# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences include jail terms of up to 20 years and large fines.

#### Other laws

You must always carry your passport, visa or entry permit as proof of identity in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

It's illegal to photograph police, the military, buildings or places considered 'security sensitive'. This includes military installations and some government offices. If in doubt, get local advice.

The import and use of religious material is strictly controlled. If authorities find this material, they may confiscate it.

Under Palestinian law, authorities may enforce the death penalty for treason, helping an enemy and deliberate killing.

Islamic law applies in Gaza. Drinking alcohol and homosexual acts are prohibited.

#### Dual citizenship

Israel doesn't recognise dual nationality. Israeli citizens must enter and leave on an Israeli passport.

Under Israeli law, you're considered Israeli if at least one of your parents is Israeli.

Men and women may need to do military service. To check, consult the nearest [embassy or consulate of Israel](https://embassies.gov.il/Pages/IsraeliMissionsAroundTheWorld.aspx) before you travel.

Australians who currently hold, or used to hold a Palestinian ID card, are considered Palestinian nationals while in the West Bank, Gaza or Israel.

If you're considered Palestinian, you may need to get a Palestinian travel document. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Israel](https://embassies.gov.il/Pages/IsraeliMissionsAroundTheWorld.aspx) for details about entry and exit requirements.

This law limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

Get to know local and religious customs. Take care not to offend.

Public displays of affection aren't appropriate at religious sites in Israel. In Gaza and the West Bank, being affectionate in public may offend.

Observe local standards of behaviour when visiting Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods.

#### Dress standards

Conservative standards of dress and behaviour apply at holy sites in Jerusalem, Orthodox Jewish areas in Israel and throughout Gaza and the West Bank.

Be respectful when photographing people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. Ask permission before taking photos of people.

#### Shabbat

The Jewish Shabbat or Sabbath happens from sunset Friday until sunset Saturday. It's closely observed in Orthodox Jewish areas in Israel.

During this time of rest in Orthodox neighbourhoods, driving and using electricity is restricted. Using a mobile phone or camera on the Sabbath is likely to offend.

Public access to these neighbourhoods is usually restricted on the Sabbath. Don't drive in these areas.

#### Ramadan

Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during [Ramadan](/news-and-updates/travelling-during-ramadan "Travelling during Ramadan"). Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public or in front of people who are fasting.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Unmarried and same-sex couples are not allowed to live together in Gaza or the West Bank and aren't allowed to share hotel accommodation either.
