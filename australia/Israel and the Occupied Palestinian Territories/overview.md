## Overview

### Safety

* Due to the deteriorating security situation, we've raised our level of advice and now advise, do not travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories due to the volatile security situation, armed conflict, civil unrest and terrorism.
* Following military strikes in Iran, there are military and rocket attacks against Israel. Israel has declared a national state of emergency. In an attack or other armed conflict, you should take shelter, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only). See our general advice on protecting your safety during an armed conflict.
* The security situation could continue to deteriorate rapidly. Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. Check with your airline for the latest updates before travelling. If you're in Israel, you should depart when it's safe to do so.
* Terror attacks continue to be a threat to civilians and may be carried out by organised groups or lone actors, including using vehicles or makeshift weapons. Terrorist attacks could happen at any time or anywhere. Always be alert. Have an exit plan.
* If you need emergency consular assistance, contact the Australian Government's Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 (if you're overseas) and 1300 555 135 (in Australia).
* Israel is a target for terrorism, rocket and drone attacks and military confrontation. There are tensions and security risks close to Israel's borders with Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. There are ongoing threats of rocket and drone attacks and military activity. Authorities are monitoring security on Israel’s northern border.
* The threat of civil unrest, shooting and rocket attacks remains. Be alert to the risk of Israeli air strikes and land-based IDF operations in the West Bank and Gaza. In an attack or other armed conflict, follow the advice of local authorities. There continues to be a high threat of military reprisals and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region. See our general advice on protecting your safety and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only). Make sure you have enough essential supplies.
* Due to the risk of a deteriorating security environment, the Australian Government has offered voluntary departures to Australia for dependants of Australian officials posted to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
* GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Israel, disrupting navigational apps.
* Land border crossings to Jordan are open but may close at short notice. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods and is subject to change at short notice. It was closed for a significant period due to the Gaza conflict and subjected to attacks, including air strikes.
* Israel has a naval blockade in place along the coast of Gaza. Don't join others seeking to break the blockade. Previous attempts to break the blockade have resulted in death, injury, arrest or deportation of foreigners.
* Since October 2023, the Israel Defense Forces has conducted major operations, including in and around Gaza and areas near the northern border with Lebanon.
* There's armed conflict in parts of the northern West Bank, including in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas. Violence can sometimes occur in other parts of the West Bank, including near Israeli settlements. Take care around checkpoints. Movement can be restricted at any time, potentially resulting in long delays. If you're in the West Bank during military action or civil unrest, stay in a safe place indoors and away from windows. Take care when visiting the Old City in East Jerusalem. Transportation and other services could be affected. Be alert to your surroundings and have an exit plan. Monitor media for the latest updates.
* Our ability to provide consular help in Gaza is extremely limited. If you're in Gaza, be aware of your surroundings and review your personal security plans. Monitor local media (including social media), UN alerts, and your own organisation's security contacts for information about changing security conditions and alerts to seek shelter. If it's possible to leave, carefully consider the safest means.

### Health

* Infectious diseases are a risk. Drink boiled or bottled water.
* West Nile virus can occur, and there is no vaccine to prevent it. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* The standard of medical facilities in Israel is reasonable. Facilities in the West Bank are limited, and if you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this. Gaza may not have any functioning medical facilities available.
