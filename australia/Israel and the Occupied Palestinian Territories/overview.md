# Overview

Latest update

We've reviewed our travel advice for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and continue to advise reconsider your need to travel overall due to the volatile security situation, armed conflict, civil unrest and terrorism. We continue to advise do not travel to Gaza and areas near the border with Gaza, border areas with Lebanon and the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem). If you're in Israel, you should reconsider whether you need to remain and, if not, depart when it's safe to do so.  
  
There's an ongoing threat of missile and rocket attacks in Israel. You shouldn't travel to Israeli border areas with Lebanon. In an attack or other armed conflict, you should take shelter, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the National Emergency Portal (accessible in Israel only – see 'Safety'). See our general advice on protecting your safety during an armed conflict (see 'Safety').  
  
Terror attacks can occur anywhere at any time, including by lone actors. Be alert to personal safety risks. There continues to be a high threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region. The security situation could deteriorate quickly, with little or no notice. This has resulted and may continue to result in airspace closures, flight cancellations, diversions, and other travel disruptions.

## Overview

### Safety

* We advise reconsider your need to travel to Israel overall due to the volatile security situation, armed conflict, civil unrest and terrorism. We continue to advise do not travel to Gaza, border areas with Gaza, border areas with Lebanon and the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) due to the volatile security situation.
* Terror attacks continue to be a threat to civilians and may be carried out by organised groups or lone actors, including using vehicles or makeshift weapons. Terrorist attacks could happen at any time or anywhere. Always be alert. Have an exit plan.
* Israel is a target for terrorism, rocket and drone attacks and military confrontation. There are tensions and security risks close to Israel's borders with Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. There are ongoing threats of rocket and drone attacks and military activity. Authorities are monitoring security on Israel’s northern border.
* The threat of civil unrest, shooting and rocket attacks remains. Be alert to the risk of Israeli air strikes and land-based IDF operations in the West Bank and Gaza. In an attack or other armed conflict, follow the advice of local authorities. There continues to be a high threat of military reprisals and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region. See our general advice on protecting your safety and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only). Make sure you have enough essential supplies.
* Military attacks may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations, diversions and other travel disruptions. Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport is open but may pause operations due to heightened security concerns at any time.
* GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Israel, disrupting navigational apps.
* Land border crossings to Jordan are open but may close at short notice. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods and is subject to change at short notice. It was closed for a significant period due to the Gaza conflict and subjected to attacks, including air strikes.
* Israel has a naval blockade in place along the coast of Gaza. Don't join others seeking to break the blockade. Previous attempts to break the blockade have resulted in death, injury, arrest or deportation of foreigners.
* Since October 2023, Israeli Defense Forces have been conducting major operations, including in and around Gaza and areas near the northern border with Lebanon.
* There's armed conflict in parts of the northern West Bank, including in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas. Violence can sometimes occur in other parts of the West Bank, including near Israeli settlements. Take care around checkpoints. Movement can be restricted at any time, potentially resulting in long delays. If you're in the West Bank during military action or civil unrest, stay in a safe place indoors and away from windows. Take care when visiting the Old City in East Jerusalem. Transportation and other services could be affected. Be alert to your surroundings and have an exit plan. Monitor media for the latest updates.
* Our ability to provide consular help in Gaza is extremely limited. If you're in Gaza, be aware of your surroundings and review your personal security plans. Monitor local media (including social media), UN alerts, and your own organisation's security contacts for information about changing security conditions and alerts to seek shelter. If it's possible to leave, carefully consider the safest means.

### Health

* Infectious diseases are a risk. Drink boiled or bottled water.
* West Nile virus can occur, and there is no vaccine to prevent it. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* The standard of medical facilities in Israel is reasonable. Facilities in the West Bank are limited, and if you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this. Gaza may not have any functioning medical facilities available.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties are severe.

* Palestinian law has the death penalty for some crimes, including treason, helping an enemy and murder.
* Gaza is in a state of war and instability. The application of laws and legal processes can't be guaranteed. Before the war, Gaza had Islamic law where drinking alcohol and homosexual acts were illegal.
