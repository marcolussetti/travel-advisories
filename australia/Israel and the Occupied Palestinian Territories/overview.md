## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in Israel and in the region is unpredictable. A ceasefire is currently in place between Israel and Iran. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of further military conflict.
* The security situation could deteriorate at short notice. Flight cancellations and disruptions could occur with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures.
* In an attack or other armed conflict, you should take shelter, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only).
* Terror attacks continue to be a threat to civilians and may be carried out by organised groups or lone actors, including using vehicles or makeshift weapons. Terrorist attacks could happen at any time or anywhere. Always be alert. Have an exit plan.
* Israel is a target for terrorism, rocket and drone attacks and military confrontation. There are tensions and security risks close to Israel's borders with Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. There are ongoing threats of rocket and drone attacks and military activity. Authorities are monitoring security on Israel’s northern border.
* Be alert to the risk of Israeli air strikes and land-based IDF operations in the West Bank and Gaza. There continues to be a high threat of military reprisals and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region. See our general advice on protecting your safety and monitor local media and public safety information updates through the [National Emergency Portal](https://www.oref.org.il/en) (accessible in Israel only). Make sure you have enough essential supplies.
* Israel has a naval blockade in place along the coast of Gaza. Don't join others seeking to break the blockade. Previous attempts to break the blockade have resulted in death, injury, arrest or deportation of foreigners.
* There's armed conflict in parts of the northern West Bank. If you're in the West Bank during military action or civil unrest, stay in a safe place indoors and away from windows.

### Health

* Infectious diseases are a risk. Drink boiled or bottled water.
* West Nile virus can occur, and there is no vaccine to prevent it. Use insect repellent and make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* The standard of medical facilities in Israel is reasonable. Facilities in the West Bank are limited, and if you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this. Gaza may not have any functioning medical facilities available.

### Local laws

* The Sabbath in Israel happens from sunset Friday until sunset Saturday. In Orthodox neighbourhoods, driving or using a mobile phone or digital camera on the Sabbath may offend people.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties are severe.
* You must always carry originals or copies of your passport, visa or entry permit in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
* Palestinian law has the death penalty for some crimes, including treason, helping an enemy and murder.
* Gaza is in a state of war and instability. The application of laws and legal processes can't be guaranteed. Before the war, Gaza had Islamic law where drinking alcohol and homosexual acts were illegal.

### Travel

* From 1 January, all foreign nationals must have either an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA-IL) or a visa before arriving in Israel. To check your eligibility and to apply, visit the [ETA-IL website](https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/) (see '[Travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories#travel)').
* Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport is returning to full operations, with commercial options becoming increasingly available. GPS signals may be blocked in parts of Israel, disrupting navigational apps and devices.
* Land border crossings to Jordan may open and close at short notice. Before you travel, check for regular opening times on [Jordanian Border Crossings](https://www.accesscoordination.org/CrossingJordanC19%20-%20view.aspx) and also check the latest public information from local authorities in Israel and Jordan to make sure border crossings are open. Visas on arrival are available but be prepared for delays when crossing into Jordan.
* The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt may be closed or have highly restricted access for long periods and is subject to change at short notice. It has been closed for a significant period due to the Gaza conflict and can be subjected to attacks, including air strikes.
* By law, you're considered Israeli if one or both of your parents are Israeli. Israeli citizens must enter and leave on an Israeli passport. Authorities will consider you a Palestinian national if you currently hold, or used to hold, a Palestinian ID card. You may need to get a Palestinian travel document.
