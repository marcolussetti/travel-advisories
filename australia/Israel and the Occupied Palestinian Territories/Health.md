#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Healthcare in Israel is not free.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you're going to high-risk areas, you'll probably need a specialised insurance policy. Check your insurance policy before you travel to high-risk areas in Israel, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and medical care are covered by your policy
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases can occur. These include:

* [Brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [Leptospirosis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/leptospirosis)
* [Leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Cases of [West Nile virus (WNV)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) cases are reported throughout Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. There's no vaccine to prevent it.

To protect yourself against illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is reasonable in Israel. However, facilities in the West Bank and Gaza are below Australian standards.

If you become seriously ill or injured in the West Bank or Gaza, you may need to be evacuated. Where medical evacuation is possible, it can be very expensive.

Doctors may require up-front payment before they will treat you. Costs can be high.
