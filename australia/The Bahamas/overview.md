## Overview

### Safety

* Armed robberies, burglaries, bag snatchings, theft, fraud and sexual assaults are the most common crimes committed against travellers in Freeport and Nassau. Be aware of your surroundings, even in areas usually considered safe. Keep valuables out of sight.
* Sexual assault frequently occurs in The Bahamas. Don't visit deserted beaches or walk alone, especially after dark.
* Food and drink spiking is a risk in tourist resorts. Never leave your food or drink unattended.
* The water sports industry in The Bahamas is poorly regulated. Be careful when renting jet skis and other water sports equipment, as many companies and individuals offering water sports activities are unregistered.
* Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can occur in The Bahamas. Medical facilities may not be able to handle major emergencies.

### Health

* HIV/AIDS infection rates are high. Take precautions if you're engaging in high-risk activities.
* Medical care is of a reasonable standard in Freeport and Nassau but limited elsewhere. Medical expenses can be very high. If you're severely ill or injured, you might need evacuation to the US. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.
