#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Armed robberies, burglaries, purse snatchings, theft, fraud and sexual assaults are the most common crimes committed against travellers in Freeport and Nassau, including in cruise ship terminals and resorts. Avoid Nassau’s 'over the hill' area (south of Shirley Street), where gang violence occurs.

Criminals target travellers in Nassau and Freeport for:

* [muggings](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)
* home invasion
* [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault)

The Bahamas has a high murder rate. Most murders happen at night in non-tourist areas in downtown Nassau. Avoid these neighbourhoods.

The Bahamas has a high rate of sexual assault. Assault can happen in many areas, such as:

* in and around hotels
* in casinos
* on cruise ships
* on the beach
* when taking jet ski rides

Food and drink spiking is often followed by sexual assault or robbery. Never leave your food or drink unattended.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* stay alert to your surroundings, even in areas usually considered safe
* be wary of approaches from friendly strangers
* don't visit deserted beaches or walk alone, especially after dark
* avoid using drugs and excessive consumption of alcohol

Never get out of your car to move items blocking the road. Armed criminals could be waiting to rob you.

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Criminals often carry weapons. You could be seriously injured or killed.

The water sports industry in The Bahamas is poorly regulated. Be careful when renting jet skis and other water sports equipment, as many companies and individuals offering water sports activities are unregistered. People have been killed or seriously injured using jet skis and other watercraft carelessly or by the reckless behaviour of others. There have been reports of sexual assaults on foreign nationals by jet ski operators in Nassau.

#### Petty crime

Petty theft and bag snatching often happen in tourist areas. Keep valuables out of sight.

Always keep vehicle windows closed and doors locked. Leave valuables out of sight, even when your vehicle is moving.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Climate and natural disasters

The Bahamas experiences [natural disasters](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident), including:

* [hurricanes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters)
* tropical storms
* [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters)

Medical facilities can't handle major emergencies. Be prepared to evacuate at short notice. Keep your travel documents up to date.

To protect yourself in case of a natural disaster:

* monitor local media, local authorities and other sources, such as the [National Emergency Management Agency](https://www.nema-bahamas.info/)
* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay in contact with your friends and family
* contact your tour operator, hotel or airline

Get local advice before entering areas after a natural disaster.

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

The [hurricane season](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather) in The Bahamas is from June to November. The region is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Tropical storms and hurricanes can also happen in other months. Landslides, mudslides and flooding can occur.

The direction and strength of hurricanes can change suddenly.

If you're travelling to the Bahamas during hurricane season, check if severe weather has affected tourist services.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights can be delayed or suspended
* available flights might fill quickly
* adequate shelter might not be available

[Severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident) may also affect:

* access to ports
* road travel
* essential services, such as water, electricity and communication systems

If a hurricane is approaching:

* know your hotel or cruise ship's evacuation plan
* identify your local shelter
* monitor local media and the [US National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)
* follow the advice of local authorities

If you're travelling during the hurricane season or following a natural disaster, contact:

* your tour operator to check if tourist services at your planned destination have been affected
* your airline for the latest flight information

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can happen in The Bahamas.

A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a tremor or earthquake. Be alert to warnings.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Co-ordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive tsunami alerts.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
