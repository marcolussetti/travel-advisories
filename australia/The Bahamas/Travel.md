#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You won't need a visa to enter The Bahamas if:

* your visit is for 90 days or less
* you have a valid return or onward ticket

In other situations, you might need a visa before travelling.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact an embassy or consulate of The Bahamas for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. The Bahamas doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Australia. Its nearest mission is the [Embassy of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas in Beijing](https://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy22583/), China. Call +86 10 6532 2922.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you'll need to meet US entry or transit requirements. This also applies if you're transiting through the US.

Check your visa requirements with a [US embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212) or [US consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/212/State)well before you travel.

#### Entry into The Bahamas

You must complete and sign an immigration card when you enter The Bahamas. Officials will stamp your card when you enter.

Keep your immigration card until you leave.

If you arrive by private charter, you'll need entry documentation.

You are required to produce a yellow fever vaccination certificate if you have arrived from, or transited for more than 12 hours from the [countries listed](https://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/wcm/connect/8b3b3842-3037-4649-b6e1-3e629821374f/Vaccination+requirements.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=8b3b3842-3037-4649-b6e1-3e629821374f), as having a risk of yellow fever transmission. 

All visitors leaving The Bahamas need to pay a departure tax. This might not be included in the price of your ticket.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Sea travel

Nassau is one of the world's largest cruise-ship ports. Cruise ships also dock at other ports in The Bahamas, including Freeport in Grand Bahama.

Medical facilities on cruise ships may not be as good as in Australia. Onboard medical treatment may be expensive.

If you plan to travel on a cruise ship:

* check it has suitable medical facilities
* be aware of the costs of onboard medical treatment.

Armed smugglers often use small boats and other vessels in The Bahamas. Be careful of the boats you're travelling on.
