#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. This means it has separate immigration regulations to mainland China. You generally won't need a visa if you intend to be a [Visitor](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/visit-transit/visit-visa-entry-permit.html) for less than 90 days.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules, contact:

* the [Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office](https://www.hketosydney.gov.hk/eng/hk_imm.htm)in Sydney
* the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/index.html)
* [Visit Visa / Entry Permit Requirements for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/visit-transit/visit-visa-entry-permit.html)

#### Travel between Hong Kong and mainland China

See the [Embassy of the People's Republic of China](https://www.visaforchina.cn/globle/) for eligibility requirements and visa types.

If you plan to return to mainland China after visiting Hong Kong, confirm your Chinese visa allows you to re-enter mainland China.

If you've recently changed your passport, but your Chinese visa is still in the old passport, take both passports with you. Officials may ask you to present your previous passport and Chinese visa.

#### Border measures

Your temperature may be checked on arrival in Hong Kong. For the latest requirements, see [Hong Kong inbound travel arrangements](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html) or contact your airline or travel agent.

#### Transit via Hong Kong

Refer to the [Hong Kong International Airport website](https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/) or contact your airline or travel agent for details on transiting Hong Kong.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
