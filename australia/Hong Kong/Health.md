#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Hong Kong. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

It's illegal to have sleeping tablets and certain other medications without a prescription. These include medications used to treat erectile dysfunction or anxiety.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Hong Kong experiences very high humidity during summer, from May to October.

Reduce physical exertion and outdoor activities on very humid days.

#### Air pollution

High levels of air pollution may trigger bronchial, sinus or asthma conditions.

If you have an existing heart or breathing difficulties, reduce physical and outdoor activities on days with high pollution.

You can monitor real-time [air quality index reports](http://www.aqhi.gov.hk/en.html) for Hong Kong.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses, including [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection ), sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Hand, foot and mouth disease

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/archives/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) is common. Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. Outbreaks usually start in March or April and peak in May. Sometimes they last until October.

HFMD mostly affects children aged younger than 10 years, but adult cases, particularly in young adults, occur.

HFMD is spread by direct contact with discharges of infected people.

Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands carefully and frequently.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, and other infectious diseases occur sometimes. These include:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink only filtered water or bottled water

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical services and facilities are of a high standard.

Costs can be higher than in Australia.

Private hospitals may require you to confirm your insurance cover or pay a deposit up-front before they will admit you.
