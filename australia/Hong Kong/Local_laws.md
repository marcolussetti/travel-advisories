# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.  
  
The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Law and the 2020 National Security Law may be interpreted broadly. The laws could be applied to activities that occurred outside Hong Kong, including social media posts. People in Hong Kong have been imprisoned for acts considered seditious, including wearing clothing with a political slogan, writing graffiti and making comments on social media.

You could be detained without charge for up to 16 days and denied access to a lawyer for up to 48 hours. People arrested under national security laws have faced lengthy periods on remand while their cases are heard by Hong Kong courts.

You could break the laws without intending to, and you may be at increased risk of detention. The maximum penalty under these laws in Hong Kong is life imprisonment.

Under the security laws, you could be deported or face possible transfer to mainland China for prosecution under mainland law. Denial of entry to Hong Kong is also possible. Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants against individuals living outside Hong Kong, including in Australia. Hong Kong authorities have also offered financial rewards for information on those individuals.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Australian Government can't intervene in the Hong Kong judicial process.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of China, they may refuse to grant you access to Australian consular services. This will prevent the Australian Government from providing you with those services.

#### Drugs

[Possessing illegal drugs](/node/103) of any kind, including marijuana, can result in penalties that include heavy fines and jail time.

Officials have arrested many foreigners for trafficking drugs.

[Cannabidiol](https://www.nd.gov.hk/en/CBD.html) (CBD) has been listed as a dangerous drug under the control of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (Chapter 134, Laws of Hong Kong) (DDO) in Hong Kong. Possession and consumption carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. Trafficking and illicit manufacturing of CBD carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

#### Importing weapons

Strict rules control the import or possession of:

* any type of weapon
* any item that looks like a weapon, including replicas, antiques, toys and fashion accessories

Hong Kong has prosecuted foreigners, including Australians, for possessing:

* stunning devices such as taser guns
* dart and spear guns
* knuckledusters
* slingshots
* extendable batons
* tear gas and pepper spray

You may be able to import, possess or purchase such items legally, including from local Hong Kong markets. To do this, you must get a permit from local authorities in advance.

These laws apply to people in Hong Kong and those transiting Hong Kong airport.

#### Importing Products

Hong Kong has strict import rules. If you don't follow these rules, you could be fined and/or imprisoned.

* take part in public demonstrations without Hong Kong government approval
* take photos of military installations

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

While Hong Kong law allows dual nationals of Chinese descent to [register their Australian nationality](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/chinese_nationality/Declaration_of_Change_of_Nationality.html), China's [Nationality Law](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/chinese/law.html) prevents legal recognition of dual citizenship in Hong Kong.

Local authorities won't allow us to help dual nationals who enter Hong Kong on a non-Australian passport.

Local authorities will deny you access to Australian consular services if they identify you as a [Chinese citizen](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/chinese/law.html). This can happen even if you enter Hong Kong on an Australian or other foreign passport and you:

* meet the conditions to be recognised as [a Chinese citizen](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/chinese/law.html)
* haven't renounced your Chinese citizenship according to Chinese law
* haven't formally advised the Chinese authorities of your Australian citizenship
* continue to maintain a Hong Kong, Macau or mainland China passport.

Australian-Chinese dual nationals can make a Declaration of Change of Nationality. Find out what the consequences of this are from the [Hong Kong Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/chinese_nationality/Declaration_of_Change_of_Nationality.html).

Get professional legal advice if you're not sure of your citizenship status under Chinese law.

If you plan to travel from Hong Kong to [mainland China](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/china?) or [Macau](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/macau), travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).
