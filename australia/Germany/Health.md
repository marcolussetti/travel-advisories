#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Germany. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

You can't send medication to Germany by post.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Medicinal products that fall under the German Narcotic Drugs Act

Special provisions apply to medicinal products that fall under the German Narcotic Drugs Act, for example, morphine. Information on travelling with controlled drugs to Germany, can be found on the website of the [Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.](https://www.bfarm.de/EN/Federal-Opium-Agency/Narcotic-drugs/Travelling-with-narcotic-drugs/_node.html)

#### Health risks

Health risks in Germany are similar to those in Australia.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tick-borne-encephalitis#tab=tab_1) is a risk in forested areas, particularly in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. Ticks are common in country areas and are active from spring to autumn.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* always use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* get vaccinated if you intend to frequently spend time in forests and meadows in affected areas

During and after visiting forested areas:

* check your body for ticks
* remove whole ticks as soon as you can
* monitor the tick site for any signs of infection

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities and care is high.

Australia doesn't have a reciprocal health care agreement with Germany. Medical bills can be very expensive.

Hospitals will need you to confirm you have either:

* appropriate insurance, or
* enough money to pay for treatment

Medical practitioners will ask for up-front payment. Medical costs are higher than in Australia.
