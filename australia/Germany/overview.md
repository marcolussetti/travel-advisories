## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorists have staged attacks and threatened more. They may target transport hubs and places foreigners visit, including Christmas markets. Attacks can occur at any time. There have been multiple attacks using vehicles or knives in the last year. Be alert in public places and report suspicious activity to the police.
* Violent crime isn't common, but it does happen. Petty crime occurs occasionally, such as pickpocketing and theft from cars and trains. Take care of your belongings.
* Racial harassment occurs. Take care in cities, particularly in the former East Germany.
* [Drink spiking](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely") can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended.

### Health

* Take care when in forests, particularly in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. Tick-borne encephalitis is a risk. Ticks are active from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks and remove them as soon as possible.
* Medical care and facilities are of a high standard.
* If you don't have insurance, hospitals may ask for up-front payment. Costs are higher than in Australia.
