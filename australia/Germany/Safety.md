To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats

#### Crime

Violent crime isn't common, but criminal attacks unrelated to terrorism can occur.

Monitor the media for news on crime.

#### Petty crime

Street crime, such as pickpocketing and theft from unattended vehicles, can occur. Bags and personal items can be stolen on trains.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* pay attention to your personal security, particularly at night
* secure your valuables when visiting the central districts and larger city train stations

#### Harassment

Racially motivated attacks have occurred. These occur more often in urban areas and the former East Germany.

#### Drink and needle spiking

Drink and needle spiking can occur at popular nightclubs and markets, often leading to [sexual assault](/node/355).

Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

To protect yourself from drink and needle spiking:

* don't accept drinks from strangers or leave drinks alone
* stick with people you trust in bars and nightclubs

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
