# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug possession, use or trafficking, even small amounts, include heavy fines and prison sentences.

#### Drones

Follow local regulations when flying drones in Germany. This includes avoiding flying drones in no-fly zones near airports and [Oktoberfest](https://www.oktoberfest.de/en) venues.

#### Other laws

Using or displaying Nazi symbols, salutes, songs, or material such as flags or memorabilia is illegal.

You don't have to carry your passport, but local authorities can ask to see it. You may need to produce it on request. Always carry a photo ID.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
