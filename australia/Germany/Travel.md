# Travel

#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

Germany is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter Germany without a visa in some cases.

You usually don't need a visa if you travel to Germany for less than 3 months as a tourist. Contact [the nearest embassy or consulate of Germany](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/foreign-embassies/foreign-embassies-and-consulates-in-australia) if you're travelling to Germany for any other purpose.

For more information on [visas to Germany](https://australien.diplo.de/au-en/service/visa/short-term-visa/2073662) and [the German-Australian Agreement on the Exemption of Visa Requirements](https://australien.diplo.de/au-en/service/visa/short-term-visa/2073662#content_2), visit the [website of the German Embassy, Canberra.](https://australien.diplo.de/au-en)

#### Travelling with Children

Border control authorities may be wary of [children travelling](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") with only one parent or guardian. Non-travelling parents can complete a [consent form](https://www.adac.de/reise-freizeit/ratgeber/reiserecht/reisevollmacht-kinder/) ([Reisevollmacht für Kinder: Einverständniserklärung zum Download](https://www.adac.de/reise-freizeit/ratgeber/reiserecht/reisevollmacht-kinder/)) to make this easier.

* [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")

#### Other formalities

Make sure you:

* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")
* monitor border conditions by checking local sources and asking transport providers directly.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Germany](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/75) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports.

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements .

#### Passport

Always carry your passport when near the border or when you enter or exit Germany, even when travelling within the [Schengen area](/node/145).

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You may receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency in Germany is the Euro (EUR).

If you're travelling between Germany and non-EU countries, declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll be fined if you don't declare it or give incorrect information on entry or exit.

You don't need to declare it if you travel to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

Nationwide and local strikes occur, affecting transport systems, including trains and airline traffic. Monitor the media and contact your travel provider for the latest details.

#### Oktoberfest

During [Oktoberfest](https://www.oktoberfest.de/en) and other major cultural and sporting events, there'll be an increased demand for accommodation and transport facilities. Expect delays and plan your travel accordingly.

#### Driving permit

You must be at least 18 years old to drive in Germany.

Always have your driver's licence, insurance and vehicle documents in the vehicle while you're driving. Always have your driver's licence, insurance and vehicle documents in the vehicle while you're driving. A digital driver’s licence may not be accepted.

You must have in your car:

You can only use your Australian driver's licence in some cases. Check with the [Embassy of Germany](https://australien.diplo.de/au-en/service/09-otherconsularservices/drivers-licence/2076016).

If you plan to drive, get an International Driving Permit (IDP) before you travel.

#### Road travel

Road conditions are similar to those in Australia, but some basic rules differ.

Parts of the autobahn (highway) network don't have set speed limits. Be prepared for very fast traffic.

Bicycles have the right of way over vehicles turning into side streets.

Vehicles must be fitted with specific tyres (mud and snow) if there's snow, ice or frost on the road.

You'll usually need winter tyres between October and Easter. However, there's no set period, and it varies regionally.

Check for appropriate tyres before accepting a rental vehicle. If the wrong tyres are fitted, you could get a fine, and your insurance company may reject any claim.

Get to know the local road rules before you drive or ride a vehicle.

Pedestrians and bicycles:

* bicycles are common
* many roads have bicycle pathways, usually coloured red, between the pedestrian footpath and the roadway, as well as bicycle traffic lights
* don't walk on these pathways. Cyclists travel fast and have the right of way
* accidents and injuries resulting from collisions between cyclists and pedestrians are common.

E-Scooters are common in larger cities:

* You don't need a driver's licence to ride them, but you must be over 14 years of age.
* They must be insured and not driven on pedestrian footpaths
* You can't take passengers on E-Scooters

#### Taxis

Taxi drivers who look for business in public places such as the airport may charge you more.

Rideshare services are legal.

#### Public transport

Germany has a well-developed bus and rail transport system. However, petty crime still happens.

Take care of your personal belongings, particularly on trains and in major transport hubs. Don't leave bags unattended on trains, even briefly.
