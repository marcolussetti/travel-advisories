## Overview

### Safety

* On 30 July, a magnitude 8.6 earthquake occurred approximately 60 km offshore from the southern tip of the Kamchatka peninsula, Russia, with a depth of 50 km. A tsunami is possible along the eastern coast of Japan with a height of up to 3 metres. Move to higher ground immediately. If there's an official evacuation warning, immediately follow the advice of local authorities.
* Japan is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. Japanese authorities have detailed plans to respond to natural disasters. In an emergency, follow the advice of local authorities and emergency signage. Move to higher ground immediately if you're in a coastal region after a major earthquake. Check the [Disaster Prevention Portal](https://www.mlit.go.jp/river/bousai/olympic/en/helpful03/index.html) for more information.
* All major disaster warnings are published by the [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://www.data.jma.go.jp/multi/index.html?lang=en) (JMA). We recommend downloading [NHK’s smart phone application](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/app/) to keep up to date with a natural disaster or other emergency alerts.
* A series of earthquakes occurred in Ishikawa Prefecture in Central Japan on and after 1 January 2024. Some infrastructure may remain impacted. Follow the advice of local authorities if travelling to affected areas.
* Regional tensions and the security situation, including with North Korea, could worsen with little warning. For advice see Japan's [Civil Protection Portal Site](https://www.kokuminhogo.go.jp/en/pc-index_e.html).
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave food or drinks unattended, and pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Get urgent medical help if you suspect drink spiking. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Japan has a low crime rate. Petty theft can happen, like bag snatching at popular tourist attractions. There's a risk of crime in bars and nightclubs. Crimes include overcharging, credit card fraud, forced withdrawal of large amounts of cash at ATMs, drink spiking and assault. Avoid taking large amounts of money and be vigilant in carrying your debit/credit card) when in bars or clubs and at parties.

### Health

* Japan has strict rules about bringing medicine into the country, including some ingredients in ADHD and cold and flu medication. If you plan on bringing in medication, you must check if it's legal before you travel. See the [Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html)website for more information.
* Restricted zones exist around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. The 2011 earthquake caused the release of lethal radiation. Radiation levels in most parts of Japan, including Tokyo, are within the normal range.
* Medical facilities are of a high standard. English-speaking medical staff are available; however, you may have difficulties finding them outside Tokyo. You may need to pay upfront before you're treated.

### Local laws

* Japan has strict alcohol laws. The legal drinking age is 20. It's illegal to drive with any alcohol in your bloodstream. Allowing someone who has been drinking to drive is also illegal. Laws restrict alcohol consumption in specific areas on certain days, such as in Shibuya around Halloween (31 October) and New Year's Eve. Smoking on the street is illegal in Tokyo and some other cities.
* You must carry your passport (or Japanese residency card) with you at all times.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Authorities can charge you if they find trace amounts of illegal drugs in your blood or urine.
* Japanese family law, including divorce and child custody, is very different to Australian law. For example, joint custody of a child after divorce is currently not a legal option, and there are limits to access for a non-custodial parent. The Family Courts in Japan generally consider that it is in a child's best interests for them to remain in their "usual place of residence". Courts, therefore, usually give sole custody to the parent who has taken care of the child most recently. Joint custody after divorce will however become possible after mid-2026, following legislative changes passed in May 2024. If you're involved in custody or other family disputes, it is important to seek legal advice about your options both in Japan and in Australia. We have produced some [general information about custody, child abduction and parental rights.](https://japan.embassy.gov.au/tkyo/FamilyLaw.html)
* Some employment agents mislead and encourage foreigners to work in Japan without the correct paperwork. If you want to work in Japan, verify the work offered and get the correct visa. Get legal advice before signing a contract.

### Travel

* Australians are eligible for Japan's visa exemption scheme for short-stay tourism and business travel. Currently, you don't need a visa to travel to Japan for up to 90 days but entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. It is your responsibility to verify visa requirements from the nearest embassy or consulate of Japan.
* If you're travelling for any other reason, contact your nearest Japanese embassy or consulate to check if you need a visa, especially if you plan to work in Japan. Penalties may apply if you work in Japan on a tourist visa.
* It's dangerous to climb Mount Fuji from September to June.
* You can drive for up to 1 year in Japan with an Australian driver's licence and an International Driving Permit. If you're staying longer, you will need to obtain a local licence. Heavy snowfalls and ice in winter can make driving dangerous. It's illegal to drive with any alcohol in your bloodstream.
