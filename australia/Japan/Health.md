#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you are travelling while pregnant, confirm that your policy covers both your pregnancy and your baby in the event of a premature birth. Medical services for premature babies can cost over $A 150,000. See the [advice for pregnant travellers](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/pregnancy) page for more information.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Different environments, unfamiliar customs and language barriers may worsen existing mental health conditions. They may also trigger new issues.

Mental health treatment and services can differ to those in Australia.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Japan has strict rules about bringing medication into the country. This affects both medication imports and medication you carry for personal use.

There are 4 [categories (PDF 250 KB)](http://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/files/000171167.pdf) of medicine. These are:

* general
* narcotic
* psychotropic
* stimulants

You may need a permit or certificate to take medication into Japan. This will depend on the medication's classification, name and quantity.

Some medication is banned, including:

* the stimulant dexamphetamine, used to treat ADHD
* pseudoephedrine, found in some cold and flu tablets
* marijuana, including medicinal cannabis or CBD oil

Authorities could detain you if you're found with them.

For narcotic medications, including codeine, morphine and oxycodone, apply for a Narcotic Certificate. If you don't have this certificate when you enter Japan, authorities may confiscate the medication.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Japan. Take enough legal medication for your trip. See the [Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) for more information.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Radiation

Restricted areas exist around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. The 2011 earthquake caused the release of lethal radiation. Radiation levels in almost all parts of Japan, including Tokyo, are within the normal range.

Monitor advice by the [Japanese Government](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/notice/index.html). There are ID checks points into the [Restricted Areas](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/pdf/20210518_02.pdf). Do not enter without permission.

The [Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA)](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding-radiation/sources-radiation/more-radiation-sources/great-east-japan-earthquake-and) provides details on radiation in Japan. ARPANSA has assessed the radiation levels in most parts of Japan, including Tokyo, to be within the normal range.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) can occur in Japan's rural areas. Get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Measles and rubella

[Measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles) and [rubella](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rubella) cases have been reported in Japan in recent years.

Make sure your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are of a high standard. You can find medical facilities with English-speaking staff in many major cities; however, you may have difficulty finding English-speaking medical staff outside of Tokyo.

Medical care in Japan can also be expensive for non-residents. You may need to pay up-front or give a guarantee that you'll cover costs before you're treated. Ambulance services are widely available but receiving hospitals may decline to accept patients unless they can provide proof of funds. Some medical facilities only accept cash payments.

The Japan National Tourism Organization lists [hospitals](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) with English and other foreign language-speaking staff.

There are many hospitals with decompression chambers in areas where diving is popular.
