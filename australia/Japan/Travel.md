#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australians are eligible for Japan's visa exemption scheme for short-stay tourism and business travel.

You don't need a visa if you're visiting for less than 90 days:

* as a tourist
* for a business trip or conference
* to visit friends and family

After entering under the visa exemption scheme, entry status cannot be changed to another visa status without departing and then re-entering Japan with the appropriate visa, such as a spouse, work, or study visa.

See the [Embassy of Japan in Australia website](https://www.au.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa_temporaryvisitor_en.html) for more information (including eligibility and required documents).

See the [Ministry for Health, Labour and Welfare](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html) and the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html) websites for full details on entry requirements.

#### Border measures

**Transit**

If you're transiting through Japan and your onward flight is leaving from a different airport, you must enter Japan. In order to transit between airports you will need to meet the entry requirements detailed above.

Please confirm any questions about transit directly with your airline.

#### Other formalities

You'll be photographed and fingerprinted electronically when you arrive, even if you're a permanent resident in Japan. If you refuse, immigration officers could deny you entry.

Travellers aged under 16 years, or who hold a diplomatic or official visa, are exempt.

If you'll be staying in Japan long term, you will need to register your details with the [Immigration Bureau of Japan](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_1/en/point_1-2.html) before arriving. Once you present the correct landing permission, you'll get a residence card. You must always carry it with you.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* in Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* if you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If you lose your passport while travelling in Japan, try retracing your steps. Lost items are often handed into hotels, shop owners, train stations and police boxes.

It's important to look after your passport carefully. Passports that have gone through a washing machine or exposed to heavy rain will likely need to be replaced.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The Japanese currency is the Yen (JPY).

No restrictions apply to bringing foreign currency in or out of the country. Declare all amounts more than JPY 1 million or equivalent, when you arrive or leave. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Cash is preferred in many places, but cards are becoming more widely used, especially in major cities.

Hotels accept major credit cards. Credit cards are still not widely accepted outside major cities, and tourist areas.

Some ATMs at banks and convenience stores don't accept foreign cards.

Ask your bank if your cards will work in Japan.

#### Local travel

Check the [Japan National Tourism Organization](https://www.jnto.go.jp/safety-tips/eng/) for emergency updates in English. The site also has advice on safe and hassle-free travel in Japan.

#### Fukushima and surrounding areas

There are some restricted areas around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. This is due to the 2011 earthquake that resulted in the release of lethal radiation. The [Japanese Government](http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/roadmap/evacuation_areas.html) specifies these areas.

If you must stay overnight in restricted areas, ask local authorities for advice on how to minimise health risks.

Monitor and follow the advice from local authorities.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Japan, you must hold either:

* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP) and a current Australian driver's licence

#### Road travel

Roads and vehicles are mostly well-maintained and traffic is orderly.

Vehicles travel is on the left-hand side as in Australia. In Japan it's illegal to drive with any alcohol in your bloodstream.

Heavy snowfalls and ice in the winter can make driving dangerous, especially if you are unaccustomed to driving in these conditions. Ensure your vehicle has the necessary equipment, including snow tyres, chains, and a dig-out kit.
