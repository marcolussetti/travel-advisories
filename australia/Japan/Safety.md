# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Japan has security measures in place at key facilities, such as:

* public transport
* public event venues
* entry ports

#### Regional Threats

Regional tensions and the security situation, including with North Korea, could worsen with little warning. Tensions, which may affect Japan, could arise because of missile tests by North Korea.

The Japanese Government has confirmed an increase in missile launch activity from North Korea towards Japan. At times, 'take shelter' alerts have been issued in some parts of Japan.

To stay safe:

* be alert to developments
* review the [Civil Protection Portal Site](https://www.kokuminhogo.go.jp/en/pc-index_e.html) advice from the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat for National Security Affairs and Crisis Management
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* check [NHK World](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/app/) for the latest information

#### Crime

Japan has a low crime rate. Even so, some petty theft can happen, like bag snatching at popular tourist attractions.

There's a risk of crime in bars and nightclubs, especially in the Roppongi, Shibuya and Shinjuku (Kabuki-cho) entertainment areas of Tokyo, and the Shinsaibashi, Namba and Dotonbori entertainment areas of Osaka. Both men and women have been targeted. You may encounter:

* overcharging
* fraudulent credit card charges
* forced withdrawal of large amounts of cash at ATMs
* drink spiking
* illegal drugs
* assault

You may be served drinks with higher alcohol content than normal. Some victims have woken in unknown places and required medical attention. Other victims have been taken to ATMs and forced to withdraw a large sum of cash while under the effects of drink spiking, or discovered high credit card charges later.

In these situations, you may find it hard to get a police report for your bank and travel insurer.

To stay safe:

* never leave your drink unattended, and be cautious about accepting drinks or invitations to bars or clubs from strangers or recent acquaintances
* don't carry large amounts of cash and exercise sensible precautions about the use and storage of your debit/credit card

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Mountain climbing and trekking

Trekking and mountaineering can be dangerous. Register your plans with local police before you go into the mountains, and take an emergency locator beacon with you.

Every year, a number of people die while trying to climb Mount Fuji.

Japanese Emergency Services warn against climbing from September to June when it's most dangerous. Check the [official Mount Fuji Climbing website](https://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/climbing-season/when-to-go-index.html) for each trail's climbing season dates.

Check your travel insurance covers you for extreme activities, such as mountain climbing.

Hikers and other travellers may encounter bears in parts of rural Japan. There have been incidents of fatal bear attacks. Some prefectural governments provide [safety advice](https://www.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/ks/skn/higuma/english.html) regarding bears. 

If you plan to hike or camp in rural and mountainous areas of Japan, follow local [safety advice](https://thejapanalps.com/en/climb/information/) and pay attention to warning signs.

#### Snow sport safety

Back-country skiing (off-piste) and snowboarding is dangerous. You should stay within the boundaries of the ski resort.

Take an emergency locator beacon with you if you plan to explore other areas of the mountains.

Many travellers have suffered serious injuries that could've been prevented by wearing the right equipment.

Check your insurance policy covers you for snow sports.

Local ski resorts govern rules in each ski region. You can be arrested and detained for unruly behaviour.

If you're skiing in Japan:

* use a helmet and protective gear
* learn local rules and get weather updates from your hotel, a local tourism centre or the local ski resort
* obey local ski region rules
* only visit areas that local authorities mark as safe
* know what your [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") policy covers you for

#### Climate and natural disasters

A series of earthquakes occurred in Ishikawa Prefecture in Central Japan on and after 1 January 2024. Some infrastructure in that part of Japan may remain impacted. Exercise caution and follow local authorities' advice if travelling to affected areas.

Japan experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:
