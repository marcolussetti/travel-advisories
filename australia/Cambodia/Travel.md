#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to visit Cambodia. Tourists and business travellers can [apply for an e-visa online](http://www.evisa.gov.kh/) or get a tourist visa on arrival. These are valid for 30 days. For longer stays or other situations, apply for a visa through an [embassy or consulate of Cambodia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/36).

Don’t overstay your visa. This is a serious offence (see below).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Cambodia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/36) for the most current visa information.

#### Visa overstays

You can only stay for 30 days from the date of your arrival on a tourist visa. Other visa types will list the date by which you must have left Cambodia or extended your visa. Overstaying your visa is a serious offence. Authorities may stop you from leaving Cambodia until you pay a fine or serve a prison sentence. Fines increase daily.

If you overstay your visa by more than one month, you risk penalties such as:

* prison
* deportation
* being banned from returning to Cambodia

Check your visa and the dates carefully. If it was issued outside Cambodia, the expiry date is not how long you can stay. It's the final date you can use it to enter.

If you want to stay in Cambodia for more than 30 days, you must renew your visa. Tourist visas can only be renewed once.

#### Border measures

You must complete and submit the Cambodia [e-Arrival Card](https://arrival.gov.kh/) within 7 days prior to your arrival in Cambodia by air.  On arrival in Cambodia, you will need to show your completed Cambodia e-Arrival Card (there is no charge for this). 

#### Staying in Cambodia

The Cambodian General Department of Immigration requires all foreigners to be registered in the [Foreigner Present in Cambodia System](https://fpcs.immigration.gov.kh/auth/login) (FPCS). Registrations are completed by hotel/guesthouse staff or residence owners. Make sure they register you. Foreigners in self-owned accommodation are required to self-register.

Renew your visa at a:

* travel agency
* hostel
* guesthouse
* vehicle rental company

You can also visit the Department of Immigration office opposite the Phnom Penh International Airport.

#### Land border crossings

If you plan to enter or exit via a land border crossing, first confirm it's open to foreigners. Check you can get a visa when you arrive. Day trips are not permitted at land border crossings.

Be alert to the security status of border regions and land crossings between countries.

Monitor local media for updates. Follow advice from local authorities (see '[Safety')](#safety).

#### Cambodia–Thailand border

There's an ongoing dispute over the Thailand–Cambodia border.

If you visit this border area, landmines and unexploded military weapons are a risk. The risk is higher in and around:

* the Preah Vihear temple (known as Khao Pra Viharn temple in Thailand), between Sisaket Province in Thailand and Preah Vihear Province in Cambodia
* the Ta Krabei (known as Ta Kwai temple in Thailand) and Ta Moan Thom (known as Ta Muen temple in Thailand) temples, in Oddar Meanchey province in Cambodia

Tourist attractions and border crossing points in this area can close with little or no notice.

#### Working in Cambodia

If you plan to work in Cambodia, you need the correct visa and a work permit. Your employment status isn't relevant.

The Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training issues work permits.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If your passport is lost or stolen in Cambodia, you'll also need to:

* get a police report from the tourist police station closest to where the incident happened
* get a replacement passport — contact the [Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/australian-embassy-cambodia.aspx)
* get an exit visa from the Cambodian Department of Immigration

Exit visas take around 3 working days from when you submit your police report, passport and exit visa request. In some individual cases it may take longer to obtain an exit visa.

Allow enough time to get a new passport and exit visa before you plan to leave. If you don't have a valid visa in your passport, this will delay your departure. You may be fined or detained.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency of Cambodia is the Cambodian Riel (KHR). US dollars are also legal tender.

ATM facilities are available in:

* Phnom Penh
* Siem Reap
* Battambang
* Sihanoukville
* Kampot

In other areas, ATM facilities are limited and may be unreliable.

Card skimming happens throughout Cambodia.

Cashing services for credit card cash advances and traveller's cheques are available for a fee at banks in:

* Phnom Penh
* Siem Reap
* Sihanoukville
* Battambang

Take enough US dollars to cover basic travelling expenses.

Ensure your US currency is in good condition. Sellers may not accept:

* dirty notes
* torn notes
* high value notes

Fake money is common in Cambodia, check received notes carefully, particularly high value notes.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Landmines are a danger in many parts of Cambodia, especially along the border with Thailand.

Large areas of rural Cambodia still have live landmines.

If you visit the north and north-west of Cambodia, stay on marked pathways.

Take extra care if travelling away from the Angkor Wat temple complex to other temples in the Siem Reap area.

#### Driving permits

If you want to drive a car or ride a motorcycle larger than 125cc, you need a Cambodian driver's (or motorcycle) licence, or your Australian licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) and International Driving Permit.

You can apply for a Cambodian licence equivalent to your Australian licence in person at the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's main Phnom Penh office or at their outlets located inside Aeon Mall 1 and Aeon Mall 2 in Phnom Penh and at the Heritage Walk mall in Siem Reap. If you do not have a valid foreign licence you will need to undergo testing at their main office to receive a Cambodian licence.

If using an Australian licence and International Driving Permit you can only operate the vehicles listed. You must carry both documents when operating a vehicle and comply with all Cambodian traffic law.

Under Cambodian law, you can ride a motorcycle with an engine capacity of up to 125cc without a licence. However, check with your insurer. Some travel insurers may not cover you for riding a motorcycle at all, even if you're fully licensed. Others won't cover riders unless they hold an Australian motorcycle licence, even if riding a motorcycle with capacity less than 125cc.

#### Road travel

Travel by road, especially at night outside major cities, is dangerous because of:

* poor road conditions
* drunk drivers
* wandering livestock
* the risk of crime

Be alert at all times on the roads and avoid travelling at night.

There have been recent upgrades to road construction on the Expressway between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and the road connecting Siem Reap township and the new provincial Siem Reap airport. Whilst this has made travel safer, care should still be taken if using these roads at night. 

Driving standards are often poor. Vehicles and roads are often not well maintained.

Streets are crowded in major cities. Drivers often ignore road rules.

Serious injuries from road accidents happen every day in Cambodia. Motorcycles, buses and coaches have high accident rates.

Large crowds can form quickly after road accidents. If you're in an accident, people might try to take advantage of you.

Speed limits for motorcycle drivers are:

* 30km per hour in towns
* 60km per hour on the outskirts

Other vehicle drivers can't go over:

* 40km per hour in towns
* 80km per hour outside towns

You must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.

If you get a speeding ticket, you need to pay the fine at a payment centre within 30 days. Always ask for a receipt.

If you plan to drive:

* learn about local traffic laws
* avoid driving at night outside major cities

#### Motorcycles

Motorcycles are a common form of public transport in cities. Check your insurance policy covers you for motorcycles, either as a driver or passenger.

Always wear a helmet.

Most helmets in Cambodia don't meet Australian standards. Bring a helmet and protective clothing with you if you're:

* visiting Cambodia for a motorcycle tour
* expecting to travel a lot by motorcycle

#### Taxis and Tuk-tuks

Official, metered taxis are generally safe and convenient. However, be alert to possible scams and safety risks.

Registered drivers with ridesharing services are available in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville. Limited services operate in Kampot and Battambang.

Flagged-down motorcycle taxis (moto), tuk-tuks and rickshaws are often used for short trips.

Many drivers do not use metered fares and may charge according to:

* distance travelled
* number of passengers
* time of day

Drivers sometimes take passengers without understanding their destination. Destinations are often identified by common landmarks, such as the nearest pagoda.

Before using a moto, tuk-tuk or rickshaw, you should agree on the fare with the driver, have some idea of the best route to take, or use ride-hailing apps such as Grab and Passapp.

#### Rail travel

Rail services are unreliable and limited. Expect frequent changes and interruptions to schedules with little notice.

**More information:**

* [Transport and getting around safely](/before-you-go/getting-around "Getting around")

#### Sea/River travel

Travel by boat can be dangerous.

Boats taking passengers to islands off the coast of Sihanoukville have sunk.

Even modern boats may be overcrowded and lack basic safety gear.

To help keep yourself safe on the water:

* ensure any boat you plan to board has suitable safety gear, including life jackets for all passengers
* always wear your life jacket, even if others don't
* check with your tour operator or boat manager that safety standards are in place, including passenger and weight limits

If safety standards are not in place, find another boat.

#### Air travel

The safety and upkeep standards of local aircraft may be low.

Local airlines often cancel or reschedule flights at short notice.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Cambodia's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=XU) with the Aviation Safety Network.
