# Overview

Latest update

A ceasefire has been agreed between Cambodia and Thailand but the security situation along the Cambodia-Thailand border remains unpredictable.  
  
Due to the recent armed conflict along the Cambodia-Thailand border which included military strikes and violence, and the presence of landmines, we continue to advise do not travel to areas within 50 kilometres of the Cambodia-Thailand border. Follow the advice of local authorities, monitor local media for updates and pay close attention to your personal security. Land border crossing points along the Cambodia-Thailand border remain closed (see ‘Safety’ and ‘Travel’).  
  
You'll need a valid visa to travel to Cambodia. If you stay longer than your visa allows, officials may stop you from leaving Cambodia. In cases of excessive overstays, you may be arrested and detained for violating immigration laws (see 'Travel'). Laws in Cambodia, including those related to incitement and defamation, can be broadly defined and applied (see 'Local Laws').

## Overview

### Safety

* A ceasefire has been agreed between Cambodia and Thailand but the security situation along the Cambodia-Thailand border remains unpredictable. Due to the recent armed conflict along the Cambodia-Thailand border which included military strikes and violence, and the presence of landmines, we continue to advise do not travel to areas within 50 kilometres of the Cambodia-Thailand border. Follow the advice of local authorities, monitor local media for updates and pay close attention to your personal security.
* Street crimes, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occur regularly. Thieves often travel on motorbikes and target pedestrians or people in open taxis. Be prepared to surrender your valuables rather than risk injury in a struggle. Significant celebrations (such as Khmer New Year) often attract large crowds and can lead to increased petty crime and more serious threats.
* Sexual assault occurs in tourist areas. Travellers have been assaulted after having their drinks spiked. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Stay with people you trust, and don't leave your drinks unattended in nightclubs and bars. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Many people in Cambodia own guns, and gun crime and shootouts are common. Explosions have also occurred. These incidents usually arise from commercial, personal or other disputes. They can and have occurred at a wide range of locations, including at popular tourist destinations.
* Scams, credit card fraud and ATM fraud are common. Check for card-skimming devices before using ATMs.
* Protests may unexpectedly turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings. Officials may arrest and deport foreigners involved in protests. Use ATMs in well-lit secure areas.
* Be wary of invitations from strangers. Never carry parcels or luggage for others.
* Be careful when visiting regions near the border with Thailand. Landmines and unexploded remnants of war remain a risk. Stay on marked roads if you're travelling in the north and northwest (see 'Travel').
* Fatal road accidents, particularly on provincial highways, are common. Be alert at all times on the roads and avoid travelling at night (see 'Travel').
* Severe storms and flooding can occur during the wet season (July to November). These can disrupt services and travel, including on the Mekong River. Check with your tour operator for updates.

### Health

* There have been reports of fatal cases of avian influenza (H5N1) or bird flu in Cambodia. Avoid close contact with birds and animals that might be infected, especially dead or sick birds, and avoid places like poultry or dairy farms and markets that sell live animals.
* Take care buying medication in Cambodia. Local pharmacies may sell fake medication. Carry enough medication from Australia for your trip.
* Don't drink homemade or unlabelled alcohol. It may contain harmful substances, particularly methanol. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Insect-borne diseases present in Cambodia include Dengue, Chikungunya, Japanese Encephalitis, and Malaria. Use insect repellent, wear appropriate clothing, and ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. For longer stays, consider taking anti-malarial medication and getting pre-travel vaccinations for Japanese encephalitis, particularly when travelling to remote areas.
* Animals in Cambodia can carry rabies. Rabies is fatal without immediate treatment. Consider getting pre-travel vaccination for rabies. Get medical attention straight away if an animal scratches or bites you, even if you have received the pre-travel vaccination.
* Outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease are common, and other foodborne, waterborne, parasitic and infectious diseases include hepatitis, tuberculosis and typhoid. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in freshwater.
* Medical facilities in Cambodia's public hospitals are often poor in quality and below international standards. Hospital stays can be expensive. Costs often increase to thousands of dollars. The hospital might keep your passport until you pay.

### Local laws

* Don’t use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long prison sentences, even for small amounts.
* Laws related to incitement and defamation can be broadly defined and applied. Be aware that some activities that could be considered the normal exercise of freedom of expression and association could be deemed by authorities in Cambodia to constitute crimes, even if they wouldn't in Australia.
* Understand and follow local laws and customs. It's illegal to criticise or insult the King or monarchy. Lying to police, flying drones without a permit in certain areas, public nudity, and possessing or producing pornography is illegal.
* Child sex offences are punishable under both Cambodian and Australian law.
* Cambodian authorities enforce 'modesty' laws at religious sites, such as Angkor Wat. Wear clothing that covers your knees and shoulders.
* Be careful when taking photos. Don’t photograph people, including monks, without permission. Don’t take photos near sensitive sites, such as military areas, transport hubs or government buildings.
* Be aware of business and employment offers that appear 'too good to be true'. Foreign nationals have been trafficked into Cambodia and forced to work in fraudulent activity.
