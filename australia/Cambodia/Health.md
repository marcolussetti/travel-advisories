#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation: the Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Mental health support and counselling

Mental health services in Cambodia are extremely limited and expensive. Certain medications can be difficult to purchase and be less effective due to the heat or stomach issues travellers may experience. Consider your personal mental health needs carefully before travelling.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Cambodia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Local pharmacies may sell fake medication. It can be difficult to tell real medication from fake.

#### Health risks

#### Methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases are widespread in Cambodia, such as [Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection ), [Chikungunya](https://www.who.int/health-topics/chikungunya/#tab=tab_1) and [Japanese Encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis).

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is also common in some regions, especially along the borders in mountain regions.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is mosquito-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis before you travel

Discuss your travel plans and other vaccination needs with your doctor before you travel.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is a risk in Cambodia.

Take precautions if engaging in sex or activities that expose you to risk of infection.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is fatal if you don't get vaccinated or receive quick treatment. Animals across Cambodia carry rabies.

Rabies is found in infected dogs, cats, monkeys, bats and other mammals.

To reduce your risk of rabies, don't go near, or pat, dogs and other mammals.

If you're bitten or scratched, seek medical help straight away.

Rabies vaccinations and post-exposure treatments are often available at larger medical facilities in tourist and expat areas. Treatment in Phnom Penh is usually available at:

Institute Pasteur Rabies Clinic  
No.5, Monivong Boulevard  
12201 Phnom Penh, Cambodia

#### Hand, foot and mouth disease

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-prevention) is common. Sometimes serious outbreaks occur.

HFMD mostly affects children under the age of 10 years. However, adult cases (especially young adults) do occur.

To reduce the risk of getting or passing on HFMD, practise good hygiene. Wash your hands well and often.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. They include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

Isolated outbreaks of [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) occur in some rural areas.

Freshwater sources, such as rivers and lakes, carry parasitic diseases like [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis).

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid block ice
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food
* don't swim in fresh water

Get urgent medical attention if you suspect food poisoning, have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Public medical facilities in Cambodia are generally poor in quality. The services they can provide are limited.

Foreign private medical clinics are available in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville.

Outside Phnom Penh there are almost no medical facilities that can deal with medical emergencies.

Hospitals and doctors generally require cash up-front before they'll treat you, even in an emergency. Sometimes they'll accept proof of your medical insurance.

Hospital stays can be expensive. Costs often increase to thousands of dollars. The hospital might keep your passport until you pay.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

#### Medical tourism

[Medical tourism](/before-you-go/health/medical-tourism "Going overseas for a medical procedure (medical tourism)") is growing in many countries in Asia, including Cambodia. However, medical care in Cambodia doesn't generally meet international standards.

Elective and cosmetic surgery in Cambodia is unregulated. Operations by unqualified surgeons can lead to life-threatening complications.
