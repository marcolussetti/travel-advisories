#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Cambodia-Thailand border

Armed conflict between Thai and Cambodian military forces along the Thai-Cambodian border has increased. This includes military strikes, violence and the use of landmines in the border areas of Preah Vihear and Oddar Meanchey provinces. Follow the advice of local authorities, monitor local media for updates and pay close attention to your personal security.

#### Public protests and events

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people may turn violent. Local police and security forces have occasionally responded with force and may not distinguish between demonstrators and bystanders.

Authorities may arrest and deport foreigners involved in protests, filming or taking photos of demonstrations, the military or the police.

In Phnom Penh, possible sites for rallies include:

* political party offices and court buildings
* Wat Phnom
* Freedom Park
* the Prime Minister's home
* government and military buildings or compounds

Roadblocks can be set up with little warning, restricting access through the city. Armed security personnel on the streets can increase around the time of local political events such as elections.

Land and border disputes along Cambodia's borders with Vietnam and Thailand have resulted in:

* demonstrations
* increased presence of armed forces
* violence
* cross-border fighting

Tourist attractions and border crossing points in these areas close with little or no notice.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, political events, protests, large-scale public gatherings and roadblocks
* monitor the media about possible unrest, protest locations and roadblocks
* follow the advice of local authorities
* don't film or photograph protests, political rallies or armed security personnel
* be particularly alert and careful in the lead-up to and during days of national significance, such as elections, commemorations, and religious events.
* show respect, especially in areas where royal family or religious activities are taking place

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

'Snatch-and-grab' crimes against travellers are common. Thieves often travel on motorcycles and steal from people who are:

* walking along footpaths
* using motorcycle taxis
* travelling on tuk-tuks or rickshaws

Foreigners have been injured in these thefts. Be prepared to surrender your valuables rather than risk injury in a struggle.

Some thieves use knives to cut bags as they snatch them.

Significant celebrations often attract large crowds and can lead to petty crime and more serious threats.

Australians have had valuables stolen from locked hotel and guesthouse rooms, often in cheaper accommodation.

Theft from luggage on buses is common.

To help protect yourself from theft:

* avoid carrying bags or carry only what you need and leave other valuables in a secure location
* walk on footpaths (where available), away from the curb, with your bag on the opposite side to the traffic
* if travelling by tuk-tuk, use those with barriers (curtains or netting) covering the passenger sides
* always keep an eye on your belongings, particularly easy-to-grab items
* avoid using ATMs on the street — use ATMs inside hotels, banks and shopping centres if possible

#### Sexual assault and other violent crime

Foreigners have been the target of [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment"), particularly in tourist areas.

Criminals often target victims:

* at night
* when intoxicated
* when travelling alone

Reports of groping and other sexual assaults are rising.

Parties, including organised dance parties on islands off the coast of Sihanoukville, can be risky. They may place you at greater risk of sexual assault.

Coastal islands are often isolated. Access to medical or emergency assistance may be limited or not exist.

To help keep safe at parties:

* pre-arrange transport with your hotel when heading out at night
* stick with people you trust, and never leave your drinks unattended at parties, bars, and nightclubs.

See a doctor quickly if you're involved in a violent crime, especially rape. There is a risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted diseases in Cambodia.

#### Violence

Many people in Cambodia own guns, and gun crime and shootouts are common. Explosions have also occurred. These incidents usually arise from commercial, personal or other disputes. They can and have occurred at a wide range of locations, including at popular tourist destinations.

Traffic disputes have also resulted in violence involving weapons. Bystanders can get caught up in these disputes.

Armed [robberies](/node/344) and home invasions targeting businesses or business owners happen across Cambodia.

Criminals have seriously injured or killed foreigners.

#### Assaults

Motorcycle and taxi drivers sometimes [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and rob foreigners late at night. Areas popular with tourists and expats are particular targets.

To help keep yourself safe from assault:

* consider using a ride-hailing App such as Grab or Passap
* be alert to danger at all times, especially after dark
* avoid travelling alone at night
* limit night-time travel to well-lit public areas, especially around Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville and Siem Reap
* travel in groups wherever possible
* don't travel by motorcycle taxi at night.

At night, car travel is often safer than travel by motorbike or tuktuk.

Ridesharing services are common in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and Kampot and are often safer than a flagged down taxi, motorbike or tuktuk. Prices are often cheaper than those you'll negotiate on the spot.

#### Scams

Criminal rings operate in Cambodia, particularly in Phnom Penh, and often use an apparently friendly person to approach travellers. They use ploys and stories to invite travellers to private homes.

Travellers are talked into playing card games, where they lose large amounts of money. Some are forced to withdraw money from an ATM or shop, often at gunpoint.

Online relationships and friendship [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") also happen. Australians involved in these scams have been asked to take items with hidden drugs out of Cambodia or may be asked to send large sums of money to assist with fake problems.

Be aware of business and employment offers that appear 'too good to be true'. Foreign nationals have been trafficked into Cambodia and forced to work in fraudulent activity, with poor pay and living conditions, restrictions on movement, and severe mistreatment. There are reports of 'scam centres' operated by organised crime organisations, where foreign victims are tricked into coming to Cambodia and other destinations in Southeast Asia and forced to work in [online scamming](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2023/TiP_for_FC_Summary_Policy_Brief.pdf). You can also learn more about [business and employment scams](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/jobs-employment/jobs-employment-scams) on ScamWatch.

Credit card and ATM fraud occur. This includes using skimming machines to store card data.

To help protect yourself against scams:

* be wary of invitations from strangers, including to visit private homes
* never carry parcels or luggage for others
* check for skimming machines before using ATMs and check your transaction statements

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Drink spiking occurs. Foreigners have been sexually assaulted after having spiked drinks at nightclubs.  

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can happen without warning in Cambodia. In the wet season from July to November, beware of:

* severe storms
* widespread seasonal flooding
* localised flash flooding

Floods may disrupt travel to some provinces. The [Mekong River Commission](http://www.mrcmekong.org/) provides news on flood levels for the Mekong River.

To stay informed and safe:

* monitor the media, weather and flood level reports, especially during the wet season
* check with your tour operator for the latest news on disruptions
* take official warnings seriously
* don't enter areas affected by flooding without advice from local authorities

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), follow the advice above and:

* keep your passport and phone in a safe, waterproof place
* stay in touch with friends and family
* register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
