# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Laws in Cambodia, including those related to incitement and defamation, can be broadly defined and applied. Be aware that some activities that could be considered the normal exercise of freedom of expression and association could be deemed by authorities in Cambodia to constitute crimes, even if they wouldn't in Australia.

There have been instances of individuals being detained and charged in Cambodia for activities that could be considered the normal exercise of freedom of expression and association.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"), but we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail terms for even small amounts.

#### Surrogacy and adoption laws

[Commercial surrogacy](/before-you-go/activities/surrogacy "Going overseas for international surrogacy") is illegal in Cambodia.

Australia doesn't have an intercountry adoption program with Cambodia. This means the Australian Government can't process adoption requests.

The Attorney-General's Department is watching to see if Cambodia will accept intercountry adoption. The department is also waiting to see if Cambodia will comply with the [Hague Convention](https://www.ag.gov.au/FamiliesAndMarriage/Families/InternationalFamilyLaw/Pages/HagueConventionOnTheCivilAspectsOfInternationalChildAbduction.aspx).

#### Marriage laws

If you intend to marry a Cambodian citizen, you'll need approval from the [Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.mfaic.gov.kh/). This doesn't apply if you're also a Cambodian citizen.

#### Other laws

In Cambodia, it's illegal to:

* criticise or insult the King or the monarchy, including online and via social media
* lie to police, including in relation to an insurance claim such as reporting a crime that didn't happen or lying about the circumstances of an incident
* be topless or naked in public places or at sacred sites, including Angkor Wat
* have or produce pornographic material, including on mobile phones, cameras or computers for personal use

It's also illegal to:

* buy or possess cultural or ancient artefacts without a permit
* fly drones in certain areas without a permit. These include areas of Phnom Penh, Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap or other sensitive areas. Seek prior approval from the local municipality
* hunt wildlife without permission
* traffic wildlife
* work without a valid work permit (see '[Travel').](#travel)

Australian and Cambodian authorities are committed to combating child sex offences. Penalties are severe under both Australian and Cambodian law.

You can be punished either in Cambodia or at home under Australian law. Penalties for having sex with anyone younger than 18 years include long jail terms.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

Cambodian authorities enforce 'modesty' laws at sites of religious significance, such as Angkor Wat. Dress respectfully, including covering your knees and shoulders. You can't enter if you don't.

Don't take photos of people without their permission, especially monks and other religious figures. It's culturally inappropriate.

Avoid taking photographs near sensitive sites, such as:

* military areas, assets or military personnel
* transport facilities
* government buildings

#### Dual citizenship

Under Cambodian law, you can't give up Cambodian citizenship. This includes even if a Cambodian citizen becomes a nationality of another country.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Cambodian dual nationals aged 18 to 30 years who live in Cambodia may have to enrol in military service. Military service for female citizens is voluntary.

If you're a dual national, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Cambodia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/36) before you travel.
