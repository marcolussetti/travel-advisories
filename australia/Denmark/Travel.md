#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Denmark is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries, meaning you can enter Denmark without a visa in some situations.

In other situations, you'll need a visa.

Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren't part of the Schengen area or the EU. Entry to Greenland and the Faroe Islands without a visa is possible for [Visa-free countries](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/US/Visum/Countries-with-a-visa-requirement-and-visa-free-countries/?anchor=63F86BF9BAE84296B40028C26E06EF02&callbackItem=AADA0185A3C54C4097E85F7B4350F32C&callbackAnchor=469FFEEF7C9545F594CC7078CC6219D1).

Get a legible entry stamp on your passport when you enter the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") for the first time.

Check the Schengen Convention before you travel.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Denmark](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/56) for details about visas, currency customs and quarantine rules.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian Government can't help you if you don't.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Denmark](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/56) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

There are sporadic border controls between Denmark and Germany. Border forces will only grant entry if you can present a valid passport.

If you're entering Denmark by boat, a valid passport is a requirement, even if you're entering from another Schengen country.

Make sure you:

* carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area")
* monitor border conditions by checking local sources and asking transport providers directly.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You could end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency in Denmark is the Danish Krone (DKK).

Denmark is a member of the European Union (EU). If you travel between Denmark and any non-EU country, you must declare cash of over 10,000 euros (or equivalent). This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare or give the wrong information on entry or exit, you'll need to pay a fine.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

ATMs are common, and credit cards are accepted in most places.

Check if your credit card has 'chip and PIN' technology. Many hotels, restaurants and shops need this.

#### Travel to Greenland and the Faroe Islands

Roads can be dangerous in winter because of ice. The use of winter tyres is recommended. Check local rules.

Cyclists are common.

When driving, check cycle lanes before turning. Cyclists often have the right of way.

* bicycles are common

* don't walk on these pathways. Cyclists travel fast and have the right of way
* accidents and injuries resulting from collisions between cyclists and pedestrians are common.

Plan your route ahead of time. Cycling is prohibited on motorways and some highways.

Cycling-related accidents are the most common cause of injury among foreigners visiting Denmark.

Helmets are recommended but not compulsory when riding a bicycle or electric bike with a 25km/h top speed. For e-bikes and electric scooters with a top speed above 25km/h, helmets are mandatory, and fines apply if you do not wear one.
