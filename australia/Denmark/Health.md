#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy must cover all overseas medical costs and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal with the [Danish Medicines Agency](https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/pharmacies/medicines-imported-from-abroad/medicines-for-human-use/are-you-bringing-medicine-into-denmark/).

Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is similar to Australia. There are major hospitals in Copenhagen, Aarhus and the Odense area. English is widely spoken.

Australia doesn't have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Denmark.

Costs are similar to, or more than, private treatment in Australia.

You may be required to pay for both Emergency and ongoing hospital treatment.

Medical services and facilities in Greenland and the Faroe Islands are limited. Evacuations can be required for serious illness or injury.

Make sure your travel insurance includes coverage for medical evacuations and hospital stays.
