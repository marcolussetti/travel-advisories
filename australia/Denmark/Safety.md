#### Terrorism

Denmark's domestic [terror threat level](https://pet.dk/en/terrorism-and-extremism) is set to 'significant' (level 4 of 5).

Terrorist attacks can occur at any time. In July 2022, a gunman at Field's Shopping Mall in Copenhagen killed 3 people and injured 7.

The Danish Government has security measures in place, including at airports and major train stations.

The threat of right-wing extremism is rising, and ISIL-inspired extremism continues to be a threat.

In the past few years, authorities have arrested several people suspected of planning terrorist attacks.

Terrorists are likely to keep planning attacks in Denmark.

Terrorists have staged attacks in several European cities. Targets have included:

* aviation
* public transport and transport hubs
* sporting venues
* places of mass gathering, including those popular with travellers

European security services have also stopped some planned attacks.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor local news
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Serious crime is low.

There have been incidents of gang-related crime in Copenhagen, especially in Nørrebro/Nordvest area and Christiania.

Pickpockets often target people in tourist areas, including hotel lobbies and public transport in and around Copenhagen.

Pickpockets and bag snatchers sometimes work together to target people.

Take care of your belongings, especially on public transport, at national landmarks, museums, railway stations and restaurants. Keep your passport in a safe place.

To protect yourself from crime:

* watch your belongings on buses and taxis, especially at night
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places, especially on foot
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked
* be alert to suspicious behaviour.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest is rare and protests are generally peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities.

Monitor the media and plan your travel to avoid affected areas.

If civil unrest affects the area you're in, follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can impact your travel. Monitor local media for updates.

Although Denmark is not prone to extreme weather or natural disasters, travellers to Greenland or the Faroe Islands should plan accordingly.

Some places in the Arctic are a long way from mobile coverage and help, including:

* search and rescue
* evacuation
* medical facilities.

Search and rescue teams in the region are highly skilled. However, help depends on the weather and sea conditions in an emergency. If you need assistance, you may have to wait a long time.

If you need to be rescued or evacuated in Greenland, the search and rescue operation could cost you thousands of dollars. Plan accordingly.

If severe weather affects the area you're visiting:

* confirm plans and activities with your tour operator or travel provider
* check the condition of buildings and facilities with local tour operators and hotels.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Tours and Adventure Activities

There are many adventure activities in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Check you have everything you need for adventure activities, including the right equipment.

Ensure you're fit enough to do these activities.

To stay safe:

* follow local advice
* check weather forecasts
* always let people know where you're going.

The weather can be unpredictable, even during the summer months.

Check your travel insurance covers these activities. Include coverage for helicopter rescue and medical evacuation.

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Polar bears have killed and injured travellers in Greenland. Don't approach Polar bears.

#### Cruise Ship Travel

Most of the areas in the Arctic, especially around Greenland, are uncharted and covered by ice. Search and rescue operations in Arctic waters may take several days to arrive and are unlikely to offer advanced life support.

Before you go on a [cruise](/before-you-go/getting-around/cruises "Going on a cruise"), make sure you take steps to be prepared and reduce the risks of things going wrong.
