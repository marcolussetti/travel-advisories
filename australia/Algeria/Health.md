#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Algeria. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Keep your medications in their original packaging.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases are widespread in Algeria. This includes [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya), [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis) and [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus). There's also a risk of [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria).

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

See a doctor if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are prevalent. This includes:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

If you're staying more than 4 weeks in Algeria, you may need to show proof of polio vaccination when you leave the country.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water to avoid exposure to waterborne diseases
* don't go near dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, seek medical help straight away.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities varies.

In Algiers, some public health services are adequate. Others are more limited.

Private health services tend to be better than public ones. Many meet basic international standards, especially those in Algiers.

Medical facilities in remote areas are limited or non-existent. This includes mountainous and desert regions. Consider carrying some medical supplies for personal use.

You'll have to pay an up-front deposit for medical services.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll be evacuated to somewhere with appropriate facilities. This might be in France. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
