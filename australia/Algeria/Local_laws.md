# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Drug use, possession, and trafficking are illegal in Algeria, with severe penalties. Foreigners caught with drugs face long prison sentences and heavy fines. Trafficking may also attract the death penalty.

#### Dual citizenship

Algeria doesn't recognise dual nationality.

Being a dual citizen may limit our ability to give consular help if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services).

Male Algerian nationals must complete a period of compulsory military service. This includes dual nationals.

Other citizenship obligations may also apply.

If you're a dual national, make sure you understand your obligations before you travel to Algeria.

#### Dual national children

Children with an Algerian father acquire Algerian citizenship at birth.

Algerian minors younger than 19 need their father's written consent to leave Algerian territory. This includes dual-national children.

Local religious laws decide child custody.

If you're involved in custody or other family disputes, consult a lawyer before you leave Australia. Get advice on the impact of religious law on your family situation. Research leaving Algeria and what you need to do.

#### Local customs

#### Dress and behaviour standards

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in Algeria. This is particularly the case:

* in rural and traditional areas
* near mosques, shrines, religious schools and colleges

Take care not to offend. Avoid physical contact between men and women in public.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

If you're female:

* wear loose-fitting clothes that cover your arms and legs
* consider wearing a headscarf

#### Religious festivals

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/node/351) is observed in Algeria. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
