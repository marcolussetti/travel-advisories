#### Terrorism

There's a high threat of terrorist attacks in Algeria. Algerian security forces are usually the primary targets, but civilians have been killed and injured in past attacks.

Counter-terrorism operations in the past years have diminished the terrorism threat level in the country, but a terror attack could still occur anywhere and at any time.

Recent terror attacks include:

* October 2021: 3 civilians were seriously injured by IED explosions in Tebessa and Batna
* January 2021: a roadside bomb killed 5 Algerian citizens in Tebessa.

#### Terror hot spots

In the past, terror attacks have focused on major dates and anniversaries.

Take extra care:

* within 100km of borders with Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania
* in the Chaambi mountains area, south of Souk Ahras
* within 450km of borders with Mali and Niger
* in the Kabylie region, east of Algiers, which covers Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Bourmedès, Ain Defla and Bejaia provinces
* in Algeria's major cities, including the Kasbah in central Algiers

Algerian security forces have a strong presence. Despite this, the threat continues.

Possible targets for attacks include:

* Foreign businesses, foreign embassies and expatriate housing compounds
* Algerian government offices, security installations and police stations
* clubs, restaurants and international hotels
* schools, churches and other places of worship
* shopping centres, outdoor recreation events, tourist areas and places of interest to foreigners
* shipping and transport infrastructure, ports, airports, aircraft, petrol and electrical infrastructure

When planning your trip, consider places known to be terrorist targets. Also, note the level of security of places you plan to visit.

To protect yourself from terrorist attacks:

* avoid needless travel in remote areas
* use suitable personal security measures and always be alert
* monitor the news and other sources for new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area if it is safe to do so.

After an attack, avoid that area due to the risk of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

[Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/57) by criminals and terrorists occurs in Algeria, particularly outside major centres.

Kidnappings can occur in the Kabylie region in northeast Algeria and in the trans-Sahara region in the south, as well as in the South-West and in remote border areas. The threat is high in the Djanet district in Illizi province and Tamanrasset province.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public demonstrations and protests require official permission, and unauthorised protests can result in arrest and detention.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

There are frequent protests in Algeria. Most are peaceful, but some involve violent clashes between police and demonstrators.

Most other civil unrest is localised, sporadic and spontaneous.

There has been a big rise in civil unrest over economic issues in recent years.

International events or local political events may also prompt protests.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid political events, protests, and other public gatherings
* take particular caution before, during and after Friday prayers
* monitor the news and other sources for planned or possible unrest or strikes
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

Be ready to change travel plans in case of disruptions.

Contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help if there are transport disruptions.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and theft from cars occurs, especially in larger cities. Crime levels are higher after dark.

#### Road-based crime

[Robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344)and carjacking occur, particularly in deserted beach areas, even during daylight hours.

Some criminals pose as police officers or set up illegal roadblocks. When you stop, they rob you or hijack your car.

To protect yourself from crime:

* stay at international hotels that provide a high level of security
* pay close attention to your belongings at all times
* avoid walking in isolated areas or alone at night
* avoid deserted beach areas, even during the day
* keep car doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* use a local licensed guide for tours of the Kasbah area of Algiers

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Earthquakes and flooding

[Earthquakes](/node/345) and flooding occur in parts of Algeria, including Algiers.

To protect yourself if a [natural disaster](/node/346) or severe weather occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local news and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

Our ability to provide [consular services](/node/117) may be very limited.
