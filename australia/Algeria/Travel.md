#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need a visa to enter Algeria. You must get a visa in advance.

Only tourists arriving and departing by cruise ship can get visas on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](http://www.algeriaemb.org.au/) for information about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

International flights and domestic flights are operational. The land border with Morocco remains closed. Contact your travel agent or the airline directly for more information and bookings.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Algeria if you arrive from a country where [yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever) is endemic.

This rule doesn't apply to children younger than 12 months.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes or engage in human trafficking.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency is the Algerian Dinar (DZD).

To avoid risks, only change money at:

* an exchange bureau at international airports or large hotels
* commercial banks in major cities

It's illegal to import or export DZD.

Hotels and some businesses in larger cities accept credit cards.

ATMs are available in major cities and large international hotels. Most accept international credit cards.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Algeria, you must have both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

#### Road travel

Road and traffic conditions are very dangerous.

Road accidents cause many deaths and injuries each year.

Armed groups and bandits make road travel risky. Armed groups are very active in Tamanrasset and Illizi provinces in southern Algeria.

Away from major highways, bandits use illegal checkpoints and blockades on roads to stop vehicles.

By law, police authorities must approve all road travel outside city limits in advance.

Avoid travel by road throughout Algeria, especially in Tamanrasset and Illizi provinces.

If you need to travel within Algeria, travel by air.

To protect yourself if you travel by road despite the risks:

* find out about local traffic laws and practices
* get up-to-date local advice on planned routes
* ask local authorities to clear travel beyond city limits before you go
* be alert to possible hazards, including roadblocks and armed groups
* don't travel at night
* make contingency plans

#### Motorcycles

Check your insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet. Make sure your passenger does too.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and limousines. Use radio-dispatch taxis within Algiers and taxi-hailing apps, rather than hailing off the street. Your hotel may also be able to help you book one.

#### Public transport

Avoid buses due to their unreliability. Buses are also often the site of theft and sexual harassment incidents.

#### Sea travel

A number of international cruise liners visit Algeria.
