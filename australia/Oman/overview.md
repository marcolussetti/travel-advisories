## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable. If the regional security situation deteriorates again this may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions at short notice.
* Reconsider your need to travel to border areas with Yemen due to the threat of armed conflict and violence. Armed conflict is ongoing in neighbouring Yemen. If you travel to border areas, be alert to possible threats. Seek local advice on safe routes.
* Terrorist groups are active in the Arabian Peninsula and attacks against targets in Oman may happen. Terrorist attacks can occur anywhere. Take official warnings seriously.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities.
* Protests can turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings. Take care around the time of Friday prayers.
* The crime rate in Oman is low. Tourists are sometimes targets for burglaries and theft especially in crowded places and from vehicles. Physical, verbal and sexual harassment can occur.
* Risks increase at night. Secure your accommodation. Don't camp in remote areas. Some women and travellers camping in isolated areas have been assaulted.
* Be prepared for extreme weather conditions. The monsoon season is from June to September. Temperatures can reach 50°C. Flooding and cyclones can happen during this time. Sand and dust storms can occur during the drier months from October to May. Follow the advice of local officials.
* Adventure tourism activities, including hiking and swimming, can be dangerous. Always look out for potential hazards and avoid possible risks. Follow instructions of local authorities. When hiking, follow marked hiking trails and other safety instructions. Make sure your travel insurance policy covers such activities.

### Health

* You'll need health insurance for the full duration of your stay in Oman.
* Malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis and other insect-borne diseases occur in Oman, especially on the Musandam Peninsula. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* Dehydration and heat stroke are a risk during summer. Drink plenty of water. Avoid long periods in the heat.

Dress modestly in public areas like shopping malls – cover upper arms and knees and avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts. Penalties, including fines and jail terms, apply to violations of Oman's public decency laws.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Severe penalties for drug offences include the death sentence. Possessing even a small amount attracts a minimum 12 month jail sentence.
* If you come to the attention of the local authorities, they may require you to take a blood test, particularly if they suspect you have used drugs or alcohol. If you refuse, you could be arrested for your failure to comply.
* Get professional legal advice if you're involved in legal matters, especially family or business law. You may not be allowed to leave Oman if you're involved in a dispute, have legal proceedings underway or unpaid debts, bills or traffic fines.
* Same-sex relationships, sex outside of marriage and pornography are illegal. Hotels may refuse accommodation to couples who can't prove they're married. You should contact your accommodation provider to seek clarification on the requirements. It is important to respect local customs and act in a culturally appropriate manner.
* Oman has strict dress codes. It's illegal to wear military or similar clothing and accessories.
* Oman has strict laws on public speech, including on social media. It also has a strict code of behaviour. Don't disrespect Islam or any other religion. Take care during Ramadan and Shia festivals. Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during Ramadan.
