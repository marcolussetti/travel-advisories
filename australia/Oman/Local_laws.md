# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Omani law applies to you even if you're transiting and don't leave the airport.

You may be detained and fined if you drink alcohol in public.

If you come to the attention of the local authorities, they may require you to take a blood test, particularly if they suspect you have used drugs or alcohol. If you refuse, you could be arrested for your failure to comply.

Behaviour that may be considered offensive or antisocial, but not criminal, in Australia could break Omani law. See 'Other laws' below.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Embassy of Australia in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is accredited to Oman. The Embassy in Riyadh doesn't have direct access to Omani Government institutions such as police stations, jails and hospitals. The Australian Government must formally seek access via the Omani Embassy in Riyadh. This can cause delays if you need consular help.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty. Possessing even a small amount of drugs can result in lengthy jail terms and heavy fines. These laws also apply if you're transiting through Oman.

Police may detain you if you are accompanied by a person who is involved in drug cases, including trafficking, possessing or using drugs. You may remain in detention until investigations are concluded for all parties.

If you come to the attention of the local authorities, they may require you to take a blood test, particularly if they suspect you have used drugs or alcohol. If you refuse, you could be arrested for your failure to comply.

Know your rights and responsibilities.

Authorities may not let you leave Oman if you:

* are involved in business or labour disputes
* have unpaid debts
* have legal proceedings underway

Serious offences, such as murder, may attract the death penalty.

The following activities are illegal:

Always ask people for permission if you want to take their photo.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships are illegal and may lead to severe punishment, including prison and fines.

Cross-dressing is also illegal.

#### Dual citizenship

Oman doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, and entered Oman using your non Australian passport, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we may be able to provide including if you are arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

Oman has strict Islamic dress and behaviour codes.

Hotels may refuse accommodation to couples who can't prove they're married. You should contact your accommodation provider to seek clarification on the requirements. It is important to respect local customs and act in a culturally appropriate manner.

Take extra care during [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event") and Shia religious festivals.

The Omani weekend is Friday and Saturday.

To ensure you don't offend:

* avoid disrespecting Islam or any other religion
* avoid bad language, rude gestures and public displays of affection
* respect restrictions on alcohol and pork products.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

To observe dress codes:

* dress modestly in public when not at tourist beaches, hotels or resorts
* avoid wearing tight clothes, shorts or low-cut tops
* choose loose-fitting clothes that cover your shoulders and legs.

Penalties including fines and jail terms apply to violations of Oman’s public decency laws

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is observed in Oman. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking (including water) and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
