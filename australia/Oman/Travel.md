#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian citizens visiting Oman for up to 14 days for the purpose of tourism may be eligible for a free-of-charge entry visa. This is subject to the following conditions/requirements:

* evidence of your confirmed accommodation booking
* evidence of health insurance to cover your stay
* evidence of your return ticket
* your passport is valid for more than six months

The Omani 14-day free entry visa may not be extendable. You'll need to leave Oman before the end of 14 days to avoid visa violation penalties. See [Royal Oman Police](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/) for up-to-date information.

 If you're staying in Oman for more than 14 days, you'll need to get a valid visa, and fees will apply. Oman is issuing visas on arrival and accepting applications for work and tourist visas. Please check the requirements with [Royal Oman Police](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/en/home).

You'll need travel insurance for the duration of your stay.

If you need to renew your Omani visa while in Oman, apply for a visa extension through the [Royal Oman Police](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/) website. Penalties may apply if you overstay your visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the[nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Sultanate of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/ministry/embassies/embassies-and-consulates-abroad/) for the latest details.

#### Entry to Oman

You need a valid visa to enter Oman if you're planning to stay for more than 14 days. Visit visas are available on arrival at the airport. However, it's recommended you apply for a visa before you travel. You can apply for an e-visa through the [Royal Oman Police portal](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/). When applying for a visa, make sure you choose the right type of visa. The type of visa you need will depend on your country of residence and the purpose of your travel. Visit the [Royal Oman Police portal](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/) or contact the [nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Sultanate of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/ministry/embassies/embassies-and-consulates-abroad/) for advice.

Your airline may have rules in addition to those set out by the Omani authorities.

Visit the [Oman Airports portal](https://www.omanairports.co.om/en/security-customs) for information on Security and Customs requirements.

#### Other formalities

If your passport contains evidence of entry to Israel, or another country's border crossing points with Israel, authorities will deny you entry to Oman.

Omani authorities may not allow you to enter Oman from Yemen without prior approval. Crossing the border into Yemen can be dangerous due to the threat of armed conflict and violence. If you decide to cross the border from either Oman or Yemen, prior approval may be required. For advice, visit the [Royal Oman Police portal](https://evisa.rop.gov.om/) or contact the [nearest Embassy or Consulate of the Sultanate of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/ministry/embassies/embassies-and-consulates-abroad/).

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Oman if you're arriving from a country where it's a risk.

#### Travel with children

Under Omani law, children with an Omani father are Omani nationals. They will need their father's permission to leave Oman.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter/leave unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

Oman may require a minimum validity of 6 months on passports to be able to renew your Omani Residence Permit.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

Authorities may not allow you to exit or enter Oman if you're travelling on an emergency passport. Contact the nearest E[mbassy or Consulate of the Sultanate of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/ministry/embassies/embassies-and-consulates-abroad/) for advice.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If you lose your passport before arriving in Oman (before you pass through passport control):

* You will not be able to enter the country
* The Embassy of Australia may not be able to provide you with a new passport, as personal lodgement is compulsory to obtain a new passport
* You may have to return to Australia.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

If your passport shows 'X' in the gender field, Omani authorities may refuse you entry. 'X' refers to those who are indeterminate, intersex or unspecified sex. Contact the [Royal Oman Police](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/) or contact the [nearest Embassy or Consulate of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/ministry/embassies/embassies-and-consulates-abroad/) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Omani Rial (OMR).

Declare all precious metals, local and foreign currency valued OMR6000 or more when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. More information is available here: [Traveller Services](https://www.customs.gov.om/dgcportal/web/dgc/traveller-services?artid=27304)

You can easily exchange US dollars and euros at commercial banks and currency bureaus.

Credit card facilities and ATMs are widely available.

Ask your bank if your cards will work in Oman.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

If you hold an Omani residence permit and an Australian driver licence, you should obtain an Omani driver licence.

If you're in Oman on a visit visa, you should hold an International Driving Permit (IDP). Your IDP should be endorsed by the Oman road authorities. This is usually be done at the rental car company at the airport.

#### Road travel

The annual death toll on Omani roads is high. You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Oman than in Australia.

Safety hazards include:

* drivers ignoring road rules
* bad weather limiting visibility
* poor road conditions in some parts of the country
* camels straying onto roads

Dangers are higher if you drive outside major cities, especially after dark, and on unsealed roads.

Oman restricts travel to some areas, including the Yemeni borders. You'll need authorisation from Omani authorities to travel to restricted areas.

You may be detained and fined if you drink alcohol in public, or if you drive under the influence of alcohol.

If you plan to drive:

* check your travel insurance policy covers you
* learn local traffic laws and practices

#### Sea travel

Territorial disputes and security issues in many of the waters near Oman make sea travel in these areas risky, especially around the islands of Abu Musa and Tunbs in the southern Gulf. [Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") occurs in the waters around Oman, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. If you travel by sea, monitor the [International Maritime Bureau](http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) piracy reports.

If you travel by sea to or near Oman:

* monitor piracy reports for the region
* be cautious and alert to possible threats
* avoid confrontation
