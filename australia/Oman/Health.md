#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance) before you leave. You must have valid health insurance to cover your stay in Oman.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers (particularly if proposing to undertake adventure activities)
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Oman by visiting the [Omani Ministry of Health website](https://www.moh.gov.om/en/) or the [Oman airports website](https://www.omanairports.co.om/en). Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Omani authorities may detain or deport travellers for:

* carrying medication to treat HIV/AIDS or hepatitis
* testing positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis - see [Health](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/united-arab-emirates#health)

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis) and other insect-borne diseases occur, especially on the Musandam Peninsula.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a low ongoing risk due to Oman's high temperature and humidity.

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medication that prevents malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a severe headache.

#### Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

Cases of [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)) have been reported in Oman.

Avoid contact with camels. Don’t consume raw camel milk, undercooked camel meat, or anything contaminated with camel secretions.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, cough, breathing difficulties or diarrhoea.

#### Other health risks

There's a risk of [Hepatitis A](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hepatitis-a) and [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid) through contaminated food or water.

To protect yourself from illness:

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Health care is generally good but can vary from region to region.

Hospitals and clinics in larger cities are better equipped.

Treatment costs can be high.

If you become seriously ill or have an accident, you may have to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

There's no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and Oman. Before treating patients, hospitals often ask for:

* guarantee of payment
* proof of medical insurance
* an upfront deposit
