# Safety

#### Terrorism

International terrorist groups are active in the Arabian Peninsula. Attacks against targets in Oman may happen.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

* Avoid all protests, demonstrations and large public gatherings.
* Monitor media and other sources for advice on possible unrest. Avoid affected areas.
* Take extra care around the time of Friday prayers.
* Plan your activities to avoid potential unrest on national or commemorative days.
* Be prepared to change your travel plans in case civil unrest disrupts them.
* If transport disruptions affect you, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Armed conflict in Yemen

Military tensions remain in neighbouring Yemen.

If you decide, against our advice, to travel to border areas, be alert to possible threats.

Seek local advice on routes to minimise security threats.

There is a military response to Houthi militants' attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea. Although military activity is currently limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, Oman's travel advice could change quickly. You should monitor the travel advice and follow instructions from local authorities.

#### Crime

Oman has a low crime rate.

Petty criminals sometimes target tourists for burglaries and theft, especially in crowded places and from vehicles.

Physical, verbal and sexual harassment can occur. Risks increase at night. Secure your accommodation. Don't camp in remote areas. Take care when travelling outside towns and cities and in crowded places.

Reported cases of sexual assault and rape against foreign nationals are low, but they do happen. Take care when travelling alone particularly at night.

Women have been detained when reporting sexual assault, as they must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid being charged. It is illegal to have extramarital sex. Some travellers camping in small groups in remote areas have been assaulted.

To stay safe:

* secure all doors and windows at your accommodation
* avoid camping in remote areas alone or in small groups

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media, even for comments published many years earlier. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes operators of adventure activities.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity,](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure") including hiking and swimming:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts
* follow the advice of local authorities
* follow marked hiking trails and other safety instructions.

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Oman often experiences extremely high temperatures. From June to September, the temperature can reach 50°C.

Dehydration is common in summer. To avoid heat stroke and dehydration:

* drink plenty of water
* avoid long periods in the heat.

Flooding may occur during the monsoon season, from June to September.

Oman may experience [cyclones](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters), especially during the monsoon season.

Rain can cause flooded roads, including in mountain areas and river valleys.

Sand and dust storms can occur during the drier months from October to May.
