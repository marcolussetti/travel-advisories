#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Haiti.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Haiti. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

#### Insect-borne diseases

Illnesses spread by insects are common, especially during the wet season from June to December.

Disease risks include:

* [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)
* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)

#### Cholera and other infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

Cholera is an ongoing risk in parts of Haiti. Cholera causes diarrhoea and vomiting. It can be fatal if left untreated.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw or undercooked foods, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are scarce and well below Australian standards.

Medicine and medical resources are hard to find.

Public sanitation is not fixed and causes disease outbreaks.

Private medical care can be expensive. Payment by credit card is not always available. Doctors and hospitals will often ask you to pay cash before treating you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
