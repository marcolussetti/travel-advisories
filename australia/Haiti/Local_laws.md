# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include fines and long prison sentences in local jails. Prison conditions in Haiti are very poor.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Same-sex relationships are legal. No laws restrict the rights of LGBTQIA+ people or groups, but anti-LGBTQIA+ attitudes exist.

LGBTQIA+ travellers may face:

* discrimination
* harassment
* physical attacks

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
