#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Haiti for the latest details.

You'll need to pay an arrival fee at Toussaint Louverture International Airport.

You won't have to pay the fee if you're:

* a child aged under 5 years
* an official or diplomatic passport holder
* a foreigner with a valid residence card
* an official or agent on a United Nations laissez-passer
* a person born in Haiti who holds a foreign passport

If you plan to do [volunteer](/before-you-go/activities/volunteering "Going overseas to volunteer") work in Haiti, arrange a placement before you arrive. You'll be unlikely to find a placement when you get there.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling to Haiti through the US, you must also meet US entry or transit requirements.

Check your visa requirements with a US [embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212) or [consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/212/State) before travelling.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Haiti. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

In Australia, contact the[Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).

If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The basic currency is the Gourde (HTG). US dollars are also widely accepted.

Exchange US dollars or traveller's cheques at established banks. Some banks accept other foreign currencies.

Don't change money on the street.

#### Local travel

Toussaint-Louverture International Airport resumed operations, but many airlines have suspended flights in and out of Port-au-Prince until further notice. Gang violence has affected travel across Port-au-Prince, including to and from the airport.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Haiti with your:

* valid Australian driver's licence
* International Driving Permit (IDP)
* car registration
* liability insurance documents
* travel documents

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Road travel is dangerous in Haiti.

Hazards include:

* aggressive driving
* drivers not following traffic laws
* poorly maintained vehicles
* unlit roads
* cars, trucks and motorcycles driving without lights on after dark
* pedestrians on roads

Avoid taking public transport or driving after dark. You may be forced to make a detour into a dangerous area.

Avoid driving during bad weather, even in the city.

Keep your fuel tank at least half full. Fuel supply is often disrupted.

Carry a mobile phone and emergency contact numbers with you. Roadside assistance services are lacking. Mobile phone coverage is patchy in rural areas.

Land, sea and air borders remain closed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

Sometimes, criminals dressed as police officers carjack vehicles close to the border on Dominican roads. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/haiti#safety)
