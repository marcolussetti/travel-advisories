# Safety

#### Crime

There's a countrywide State of Emergency in effect in response to gang violence.

Toussaint-Louverture International Airport resumed operations, but many airlines have suspended flights in and out of Port-au-Prince until further notice. Gang violence has affected travel across Port-au-Prince, including to and from the airport.

The security situation remains volatile.

Violent crime is common, including against tourists and expats. Incidents include:

* murder
* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* carjacking

Your risk increases at night and in isolated areas.

Police have very limited resources to respond and help.

Gang violence is concentrated in certain areas. It is escalating in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and extends to the Artibonite region. Gangs are increasingly attacking residential neighbourhoods and kidnapping groups of people. Armed gangs control most of Port-au-Prince.

Hotspots for violent crime include:

* Artibonite Central
* Bas-Delmas
* Bel Air
* Carrefour
* Carrefour Drouillard
* Champs-de-Mars
* Cité Soleil
* Croix-des-Bouquets
* Downtown Port-au-Prince
* Fontamara
* Jalousie
* Laboule 12
* Martissant
* Portail Léogane
* Road to the airport
* Santo
* Tabarre
* Torcelle
* Toussant Brave

Thieves target travellers who've just arrived in the country. They may try to distract you to steal your passport and valuables.

Criminal gangs have roadblocked areas around Port-au-Prince and on national highways to steal from car passengers.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be alert to your surroundings and extremely cautious
* think carefully about your security at your hotel and getting around.
* consider organising tailored security arrangements and preparing contingency plans.
* don't go out after dark
* travel with someone who speaks Kreyòl
* avoid showing signs of wealth
* have someone meet you at the airport or pre-book your airport transfers
* be careful sharing your travel plans
* keep your vehicle windows up and doors locked, even when moving

Armed robberies regularly occur in Pétion-Ville. If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Criminals are often armed, and you can be seriously injured or killed.

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially sexual assault, get immediate medical help. The risk of HIV/AIDS infection is high.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Other crime

People leaving banks are targets for thieves on motorcycles. Avoid withdrawing or carrying large amounts of money.

Public transport is unsafe. Avoid:

* taxis
* tap taps (vans with a covered tray area)
* moto-taxis (motorcycle taxis)

Be careful dealing with strangers or people you've just met. Be wary of people hanging around near your hotel.

* Photography can look suspicious, especially in remote areas. Some travellers have been assaulted for taking photos. Ask for permission before you take someone's photograph.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The political situation is very unstable. There's a constant risk of violence and social unrest.

Limit your movements. Monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation. Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place. Follow the instructions of local authorities.

There are ongoing violent protests, roadblocks, and food and fuel shortages.

Local authorities, including the police, may be unable to control the developing situation or to help you.

Carry your proof of identity and documents for your vehicle in case you pass a security checkpoint.

Roadblocks are common, particularly in Port-au-Prince and on major highways.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* limit your movements as much as possible
* avoid demonstrations and crowds
* monitor the local media for new security threats
* review your departure options
* stock up on essential supplies when it's safe

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnappings are common in Haiti. We continue to advise that you do not travel to Haiti due to the very high levels of kidnapping. Haiti has one of the highest per capita kidnap rates globally.

Hundreds of foreign nationals have been abducted. Victims have included missionaries, aid workers and children and are often selected based on perceived wealth. Most of the victims have been released in exchange for ransom. In some cases, victims have disappeared or been killed. Locals and foreign nationals have been targets of mass kidnappings in public transport including buses. Conflicts between criminal groups will continue to drive kidnap-for-ransom incidents in Port-au-Prince. Express kidnapping is a problem in urban areas.

Be careful in the waters around Haiti. You risk piracy and assault in these areas.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Hurricanes and severe weather

The hurricane season is from June to November. Tropical storms and hurricanes can happen any time of year.

Heavy rainfalls can cause flooding, landslides and mudslides, disrupting essential services and infrastructure.

If you're travelling during hurricane season, ask your tour operator if tourist services at your destination have been affected. Check for updates from the [US National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/). The direction and strength of hurricanes can change suddenly.

If there's a hurricane or severe storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available
* port access might be affected

Severe weather may also affect:

* access to ports
* road travel
* essential services, such as water, electricity and communication systems

If a hurricane is approaching:

* identify your local shelter
* know the evacuation plan for your hotel or cruise ship
* keep in touch with family and friends
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Haiti is in an earthquake zone. [Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") may happen. Get information from the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/).

Infrastructure from a 2010 earthquake is still damaged, including:

* health services
* roads
* telecommunications
* other utilities

Damaged water and sewerage systems have increased disease outbreaks.

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis may occur in Haiti. A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a tremor or earthquake. Be alert to warnings.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive tsunami alerts.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea
* Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
