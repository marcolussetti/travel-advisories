* Toussaint-Louverture International Airport has resumed operations, but many airlines have suspended flights in and out of Port-au-Prince until further notice. Gang violence has affected travel across Port-au-Prince, including to and from the airport.

* Violent crime is common in Haiti, including murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault and carjacking. The risk increases at night and in isolated areas. Gang violence is concentrated in certain areas. It is escalating in the capital, Port-au-Prince and extends to the Artibonite region. Gangs are increasingly attacking residential neighbourhoods and kidnapping groups of people. Armed gangs control most of Port-au-Prince. Since April 2023, vigilante groups have attacked and killed alleged gang members in some Port-au-Prince neighbourhoods and the provinces. Be alert to your surroundings. Don't go out after dark.
* Kidnappings are common in Haiti. Since September 2020, hundreds of foreign nationals have been abducted. Victims have included missionaries, aid workers and children. Most of the victims have been released in exchange for ransom. In some cases, victims have disappeared or been killed. Be extremely vigilant at all times.
* Power outages are frequent. Shortages of essential supplies such as fuel, water and food occur frequently.
