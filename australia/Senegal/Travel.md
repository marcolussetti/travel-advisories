#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa requirements

Contact an [Embassy or Consulate of Senegal](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/175) for entry and exit details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Entry to Senegal

Air, land and sea borders are open. Contact your travel provider for details.

Travel requirements can change at short notice. You may need to provide proof on onward travel and accommodation when entering Senegal. Check with your nearest [Senegal Embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/175) for details.

Familiarise yourself with Senegal’s [customs measures](https://www.douanes.sn/ndn69/) and declare anything subject to taxes or duties when exiting Senegal.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Senegal. If you don't have a certificate, authorities may quarantine you. You may also need a mandatory vaccination at your own cost.

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to travel to other countries after visiting Senegal.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the West African CFA Franc (XOF).

You can't easily change Australian dollars.

You can change US dollars and euros at commercial banks and exchange bureaus. Only use reputable ATMs or exchange bureaus, as there is a risk you will be scammed with fake money.

Major hotels in Dakar accept credit cards. You'll find ATMs in Dakar, but banking facilities are hard to find outside the capital.

Plan ahead. Have enough cash to meet your needs. Withdrawal limits can be low, and ATMs regularly run out of money, including in Dakar. 

Ask your bank if your cards will work. Credit and debit card fraud is common.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Landmines are dangerous in the Casamance region, particularly in more remote locations off main roads, including along the Guinea-Bissau border (refer to safety and security).

#### Driving permit

To drive in Senegal, you need both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP)
* an Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

Get an IDP before you leave Australia.

As well as the above, you must also carry the following documents in your vehicle:

* valid insurance papers
* vehicle registration/matriculation card ("carte grise")
* "vignette" tax disc for the current year

These documents should be obtained from the government department, Senegal Services, when registering your vehicle after import or purchase. If you are hiring a vehicle, ensure that the car hire company provides these with the vehicle.

#### Road travel

Driving in Senegal can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* poor-quality roads or damaged roads as a result of torrential rain during the June to September wet season
* unsafe driving practices
* poorly maintained vehicles
* not enough street lighting
* traffic congestion, particularly in the lead-up to major religious and cultural festivals
* pedestrians and animals on the road

If you plan to drive in Senegal:

* understand local traffic laws and practices
* look out for hazards, especially after dark
* carry all required documents with you, including a certified copy of your passport

If you have an accident, you must contact the police and wait for them to arrive at the scene, as long as it is safe for you to do so. Do not move your car until a police officer gives you permission, unless you feel you're in danger or a crowd is beginning to form. In remote areas, go to the nearest police station to report the accident.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer if your policy covers you to ride a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines. It's best to arrange these through your hotel and agree on a fare before beginning the trip. Many taxis do not have a meter.

#### Public transport

Avoid using public transport in Senegal, including motorbikes and van taxis. Road safety is an issue, and vehicles are poorly maintained.

#### Sea travel

Ferry travel is risky due to low safety standards and bad weather. There may be too many passengers and not enough life jackets. Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.
