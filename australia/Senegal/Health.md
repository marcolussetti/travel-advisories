#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Senegal. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) (Department of Health and Aged Care) is common in Senegal. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

Other common insect-borne diseases include:

* [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) (World Health Organization)
* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) (Department of Health and Aged Care)
* [zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus) (World Health Organization)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) (World Health Organization) infection is high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Common waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [leptospirosis](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B4221)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles)
* [polio](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/global-polio)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur. Follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* get medical attention straight away if an animal scratches or bites you

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical care and facilities in Senegal are limited, especially outside Dakar. Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.

Ambulances are rarely available outside Dakar and can face delays when responding to incidents in Dakar. It may be better to take a vehicle or taxi to the nearest hospital than wait for an ambulance.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you're seriously sick or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a location with better facilities. Ensure you have adequate travel insurance that covers medical evacuation, which can be very expensive.
