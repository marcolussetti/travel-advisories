## Overview

### Safety

* Protests and large public gatherings are common, particularly near government buildings and public areas. Rioting can occur across several neighbourhoods in Dakar and other areas of Senegal. Protests have turned violent, resulting in several deaths and injuries. Avoid protests and public gatherings and remain vigilant. Avoid unnecessary travel, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media for updates.
* Armed bandits and separatist groups operate in the Casamance region. There are frequent clashes between these groups and the military.
* There are landmines in the Casamance region, particularly in remote areas off main roads, including near the Guinea-Bissau border. Don't travel after dark and only use the main roads. Be aware of your personal security.
* Pickpockets, bag snatchers and thieves on motorbikes are common in large crowds. Muggings and robberies occur. Criminals target foreigners, especially at night. Officials or people posing as them may try to extort money from foreigners. Don't walk after dark. Always lock your doors, even when you're inside.
* Terrorism is a threat. Possible targets include hotels and other places foreigners visit. Remote regions are also vulnerable to terror attacks, including near the borders with Mauritania and Mali, where Jihadist groups are active. Always have an exit plan if you visit a possible terror target.
* Access to essential services, including medical care, can be impacted by strikes with little notice.

### Health

* Yellow fever is common. Get vaccinated before you travel.
* Other insect-borne diseases include malaria and dengue. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is high. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Common waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases include cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities in Senegal are limited, especially outside Dakar. You may need to pay cash up-front, even in an emergency. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include lengthy jail terms.
* Always carry photo ID. Officials can detain you if you can't show it on request.
* Don't drink and drive. Driving after drinking any amount of alcohol is illegal.
* Same-sex relations are against the law.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph government buildings, official facilities and airports.
* Senegal's dress and behaviour standards are conservative. If in doubt, seek local advice.

### Travel

* Only use registered taxis and limousines. Arrange these through your hotel. Don't use public transport. Vehicles are poorly maintained and roads are unsafe.
* The local currency is the Central African Franc (CFA Franc or XAF). It's difficult to exchange Australian dollars. Exchange US dollars and euros at commercial banks and exchange services. Major hotels in Dakar accept credit cards. There are ATMs in Dakar, but they are limited outside the capital. Bring enough cash to cover your stay.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest high commission/embassy or consulate of Senegal for the latest details.
