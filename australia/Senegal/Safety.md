# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations are common, particularly around Senegal's government buildings and in public areas.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Previous protests across Senegal have resulted in several deaths and injuries. Protestors sometimes block major roads, including the road between Blaise Diagne International Airport and the city of Dakar.  
Disruptions to communication networks and internet service can occur with little notice, especially during periods of civil unrest.

Access to essential services, including medical care, can be impacted by strikes with little notice. Consider stocking up on food, water and fuel in case supplies are interrupted.

Avoid protests and public gatherings and remain vigilant. Limit unnecessary travel. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media for updates.

#### Casamance and border regions

The situation in the Casamance region in southern Senegal is volatile. Armed bandits sometimes attack travellers in the area. Conflict between separatist groups and the Senegalese Army is possible. People have died. Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote areas off main roads, including the border with Guinea-Bissau. 

If you travel elsewhere in the Casamance region:

* don't travel after dark
* stick to main roads, travel in a convoy
* always be aware of your personal security
* monitor news of possible civil unrest
* do not pull over if anyone flags you down

We continue to advise do not travel to [Mali](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/mali) and reconsider your need to travel in border regions with Senegal due to the dangerous security situation and the threat of terrorism and kidnapping. There is increased terrorist and serious organised crime activity across the border in Kayes Region in Mali.

We continue to advise reconsider your need to travel to [Mauritania](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/mauritania) due to the threat of terrorism and kidnapping and the risk of violent crime. Higher levels apply in some areas. Crossing the border into Mauritania can be time-consuming, and officials may ask for payments before they allow you to cross.

#### Crime

Officials or people posing as officials, may try to detain or extort money from foreigners, including at the airport. Unlicensed taxi drivers may try to over-charge tourists arriving at the airport. Pre-arrange transport with your accommodation or a trusted contact.

Stay in hotels that have robust security measures.

In Dakar, muggings and robberies are common. You're most at risk of petty crime in large crowds, or at quiet beaches towards the end of the day. Look out for:

* pickpockets
* bag snatchers
* thieves on motorbikes

Criminals target foreigners, especially at night.

Home robberies happen often, usually in the evenings or early mornings.

To protect yourself from crime:

* don't walk alone
* don't carry bags that are easy to snatch
* avoid wearing conspicuous jewellery and expensive watches
* avoid walking at night, especially in isolated areas
* always lock your doors, even when you're inside
* always keep vehicle doors and windows locked, even when moving

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams

Internet [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") come in many forms, including romance, friendship, business and job offers. These scams often originate in West African countries, including Senegal.

If you travel to Senegal as a scam victim, you may be at risk of [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping"), [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and robbery. Some scam victims have been killed.

In commercial scams, criminals ask for details of safe bank accounts to transfer large amounts of money. They may:

* promise a percentage of this amount to you
* send fake cashier cheques for urgent goods shipments
* request large fees for a fake government contract
* extort money from you for a bogus business opportunity

In relationship scams, criminals often meet their victims through internet dating sites or chat rooms. Once a connection develops, they may ask you to send money so they can come to Australia.

After you transfer money, the relationship ends.

They may also ask you to come to Africa to meet them.

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Senegal to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is a threat in the border regions with Mali and the Casamance region of southern Senegal.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. This includes in Senegal.

Although Senegal has not experienced recent terrorist attacks, there is a regional terrorist threat to West African countries and attacks could occur at any time. Remote areas are particularly vulnerable to terror attacks, including by groups from nearby and neighbouring countries. This includes areas near the borders with Mauritania and Mali.

Attacks can be random and occur in places foreigners visit, such as:

* public transport
* shopping areas
* places of worship
* sporting events
* entertainment and food venues
* airports and other transport hubs
* embassies and government buildings

To stay safe from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* avoid crowds and other possible targets for terror attacks
* report any suspicious activity or items to police
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area immediately if you can.

Avoid the area where the attack occurred, due to the risk of secondary attacks.

#### Swimming safety

An increasing number of children drown each year in the Atlantic Ocean off Senegal. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast.

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* do not swim in the ocean if you are inexperienced in swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* if possible, take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities

#### Climate and natural disasters

The rainy season is June to September. Flooding may occur, which makes some roads hard to travel on. Mudslides and landslides are a significant risk.

To protect yourself if a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* closely monitor local media and other sources
* follow advice from local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family
