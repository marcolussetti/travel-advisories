#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling. Local prison conditions are harsh. Accused persons may spend lengthy periods on remand before being tried. 

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. This can include long jail terms.

Senegal recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

Senegal has conservative standard of behaviour and dress, particularly during Ramadan. Avoid revealing clothing and displays of public affection. Take care not to offend.

Government offices, schools and most businesses close for the Islamic holiday feast of sacrifice ('Eid al-Adha' or 'Tabaski').

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Senegal. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time. If you're visiting during Ramadan, seek advice about additional considerations from your tour guide, hotel or trusted contacts.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
