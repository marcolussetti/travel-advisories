#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can be unpredictable and may turn violent. Avoid protests or demonstrations. Maintain your security awareness and follow the advice of local authorities.

Liberia has become increasingly stable since the end of the internal conflict in 2003. Some sensitive political issues persist.

There are ongoing security issues near the border with Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), due to local tensions and the presence of armed militias. Cross border attacks have previously occurred and could happen again, especially in Grand Gedeh and River Gee counties.

When you're in Liberia:

* don't talk about political issues
* avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations

#### Crime

You may be a target for petty crime, including [mugging, purse snatching and pickpocketing](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety).

Violent crime may also be directed at foreigners. This includes [home invasions](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344), [aggravated sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault) and [armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery). If you're a victim of violent crime, especially sexual assault or rape, get immediate medical attention.

Most crimes are opportunistic, but there are organised criminal gangs. Thieves are often armed with knives or machetes but occasionally also carry firearms. Avoid carrying valuables or large sums of money in public and avoid obvious displays of wealth. 

Be aware of your surroundings. Don't travel alone or after dark. Crime significantly increases at night due to the lack of electricity in many parts of the capital. Avoid areas where there are few people, such as beaches.

The Liberian National Police has very limited capability to prevent or detect crime or provide emergency response in any part of the country. Emergency services are not consistently available. Calls to emergency services may not be answered. There is no landline telephone service in Liberia, and cellular phone communication may experience disruptions in service.

Consider your security arrangements carefully before you arrive in Liberia. Stay only in reputable accommodation with adequate guarding and other security arrangements. Arrange for transport, including travel to and from the airport, in advance. 

#### Scams and fraud

Internet [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") come in many forms. They may start as romance, friendship, business or job opportunities.

These scams often originate in West African countries, including Liberia.

If you travel to Liberia as a scam victim, you may be [kidnapped](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") and killed.

Common fraud schemes fall into two main categories - commercial and relationship scams.

In commercial scams, criminals ask for details of safe bank accounts to transfer large amounts of money. They may:

* promise you a payment
* send fake cashier cheques for urgent goods shipments
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* extort money from you for a fake business opportunity

In relationship scams, criminals often meet their victims through internet dating sites or chat rooms. Once they have formed a connection, they may ask you to:

* send money so they can come to Australia
* come to Africa to meet them

Once you transfer money, the relationship often ends.

To avoid being a victim of a scam:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money until you've thoroughly checked who you're sending it to

If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Don't travel to Liberia to get your money back or to get revenge.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to public Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. While there haven't been any recent terrorist attacks in Liberia, they may still occur. Targets could include beach resorts, cafés, restaurants and hotels visited by foreigners. You should be vigilant in these locations and avoid any crowded places and public gatherings or events. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Swimming safety

Very strong coastal currents are common, and there are no lifeguards posted on beaches. Do not swim alone or after dark. Get local advice before you swim.

There's a risk from poisonous jellyfish, including the highly venomous Portuguese man-of-war.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Flooding may happen in the rainy season from May to November. Road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season and many areas become inaccessible, even with a four-wheel drive vehicle.

If a [natural disaster](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) or [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident) happens, follow the advice of local authorities.
