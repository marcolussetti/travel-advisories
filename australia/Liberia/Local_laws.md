# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

It's a serious offence to have, use or traffic illegal drugs. Penalties can include large fines and long jail terms.

#### Other laws

Same-sex relationships are illegal.

It's also illegal to:

* have pornographic material
* take photos around military and government buildings, airports, seaports, bridges and important government buildings
* export diamonds, unless you follow local export laws

Penalties can be severe. Local prison conditions are harsh.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Dual citizenship is legally recognized in Liberia. Always travel on your Australian passport.

If you enter Liberia on a Liberian passport, local authorities will treat you as a citizen. This limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

Liberia is a conservative society, especially in areas outside Monrovia.

Take care not to offend.

Think about your clothing choices. Local women wear loose-fitting clothes that cover the upper arms and legs.
