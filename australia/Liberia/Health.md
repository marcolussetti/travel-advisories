#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave. Carry basic medical supplies.

Hospitals and medical facilities are poorly equipped. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care. 

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Liberia. In Liberia, medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, may be counterfeit, and are generally unavailable in most areas. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what your medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including Liberia.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) (World Health Organization) infection is high.

Take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Yellow fever

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) (Department of Health and Aged Care) is widespread in Liberia. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

#### Lassa fever

[Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever) may be a risk. Monitor local media and the World Health Organization for updates.

Lassa fever is spread through contact with rodents or body fluids of infected people. To protect yourself:

* avoid contact with rodents and their droppings
* keep food in rodent-proof containers
* don't eat any food if it could be contaminated
* avoid contact with the blood and body fluids of infected people
* avoid contact with items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids (clothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment)

Get immediate medical help if you develop any symptoms of Lassa fever, including a fever, weakness in your body or unexplained pain.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) (World Health Organization) and other insect-borne illnesses are common.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

#### Other health risks

Common waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/about)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* consider vaccinations against these diseases
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs

Get medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are poor in Monrovia and are extremely limited outside the capital. Many medical procedures are not available. Blood supplies are unreliable and unsafe. There's no effective public or private accident and emergency or ambulance service anywhere in the country.

Medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, may be counterfeit, and are generally unavailable in most areas. Carry basic medical supplies.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease. Mandatory quarantine facilities are poor and have very limited health care.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you are seriously ill or injured, you will need evacuation to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.
