#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Liberia.

You can get consular help from the Australian High Commission in Accra, Ghana.
