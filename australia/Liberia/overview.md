## Overview

### Safety

* Demonstrations and large public gatherings can take place and may turn violent. Avoid protests or large public gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor media for information.
* Muggings, burglary and armed robbery can happen. The police can't always help or protect you. Be aware of your surroundings. Don't travel alone or after dark.
* Power outages are common. There's no landline telephone service in Liberia, and mobile phone communication may be disrupted. Plan accordingly.
* Near the border with Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), local tensions and the presence of armed militias are causing ongoing security issues.
* Internet scams often originate in West African countries. Be wary of online contact from people you don't know. Don't send money until you've checked who you're sending it to. Don't travel to Liberia to get your money back or to get revenge.
* Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.

* The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is high. Take precautions if you're engaging in high-risk activities.
* Yellow fever is widespread. Get vaccinated before you travel.

* Common waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases can occur. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water. Don't swim in fresh water.
* Medical and emergency services are very limited. You may need to pay cash up-front, even in an emergency. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Make sure you have the right insurance and enough money to cover all your costs.
