#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) and ports are open, but may close with little notice.

#### Visa conditions

A visa is required to travel to Liberia.  Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy or Consulate of Liberia](https://www.mofa.gov.lr/general/foreign-missions) for details about visas, currency and customs.

#### Border measures

COVID-19 border measures can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Liberia for details about COVID-19 entry and exit requirements, visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules. You should also confirm rules for departure with your airline, noting these rules may vary between airlines.

You should be prepared for travel restrictions and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.

#### Other formalities

#### Health checks

Be prepared for health checks at border crossings.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Liberia (see '[Health').](#health)

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for six months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/apply-or-renew).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Liberia’s banking sector may experience cash shortages (of both US and Liberian dollars). The Central Bank of Liberia announced that from 15 May 2024, Liberian dollar banknotes printed before 2021 would no longer be accepted as legal tender. 

Banks and foreign exchange facilities may be unable to pay out transferred funds or fulfil ATM withdrawals. Bring sufficient cash, in US dollars, to cover all expenses.   
  
Most places won't accept credit cards, and only a few businesses will take traveller's cheques. There have been reports of financial information being compromised, even at hotels where credit cards are routinely accepted. Always keep your credit card in sight.  
  
ATMs are limited in Monrovia.  
  
Money transfer services, including Western Union and Moneygram, have agents in Monrovia.

#### Local travel

Always carry photo ID. Government security checkpoints will ask to see it.

Outside Monrovia, there are few tourist facilities and infrastructure is poor.

Land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) and ports are open but may close with little notice.

Police, or others posing as local authorities, may ask for money, particularly when you are crossing borders. If this occurs, ask for an official, signed receipt for any payments.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Liberia for up to 12 months with an International Driving Permit (IDP). You will also need to carry a police cover note in addition to your IDP.  

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

After 12 months, you need a Liberian licence to drive.

#### Road travel

Driving in Liberia is dangerous, especially after dark. Serious traffic accidents are common. Get security advice about travelling by road anywhere outside Monrovia. 

Road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season (May to November). Many roads may become impassable even with a four-wheel drive.

Most foreign nationals travelling by road outside Monrovia hire a car with a driver and travel in convoy of at least two vehicles in case of breakdowns or possible attacks. Use major roads when travelling outside Monrovia, especially near the airport or the Cote d'Ivoire border. Only use the main roads when travelling in remote border areas of Grand Gedeh and River Gee counties. Avoid travelling at night.

Other hazards include:

* poor road conditions
* badly maintained vehicles, often with no lights
* poor or no lighting

Exercise extreme caution in the event of an accident. Crowds may form quickly around accidents and may become violent.

Pull over to the side of the road immediately when instructed by security forces travelling with VIP convoys.

Always carry ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers. Checkpoints may be set up on roads throughout the country. You’re more vulnerable to being robbed at an illegal checkpoint at night.

To stay safe on the road:

* get to know local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to possible hazards, especially at night
* keep your windows up and doors locked, even when driving

#### Public transport

[Public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport) options are limited, and vehicles are often overloaded and poorly maintained. Foreigners have reported assaults and robberies happening in taxis. Three-wheeled “kekes” (motorized rickshaws) are extremely dangerous and should be avoided.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Liberia's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EL) with the Aviation Safety Network.
