# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you're an Australian citizen with Iranian nationality, our ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited.

The Australian Government may not be notified if you're detained. We can't guarantee consular access to any Australian detained or arrested. We also can't guarantee access to legal representation.

#### Drugs

Penalties for importing and possessing drugs are severe and include the death penalty.

Authorities have executed foreigners for drug-related offences in recent years.

#### Other laws

Get professional advice if you're involved in local legal proceedings. In particular, seek advice on matters of family law, such as:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support

Know your rights and responsibilities.

Penalties for serious offences, including security related offences, may result in death and corporal punishment. Same-sex relations are considered serious offences.

These activities are illegal in Iran:

* homosexual acts for both men and women
* close contact between unmarried men and women
* being in a de facto relationship
* failing to meet the legal dress code
* importing alcohol, pornography, pork products or short-wave radios
* importing printed or recorded Western material, including those with a religious theme
* manufacturing, selling or consuming alcoholic drinks

Local authorities consider domestic violence to be a private family matter. Iranian law does not prohibit domestic violence.

Authorities have stopped Australians and Australian-Iranian dual nationals, including mothers with children, from leaving Iran. Husbands can legally place border alerts ('stop orders') on their spouse and children where there are pending custodial disputes. Overturning stop orders can be a time consuming and complicated process.

The Australian Government cannot prevent or overturn a stop order on an Australian citizen.

#### Dress and behaviour

Iran has strict Islamic codes of dress and behaviour.

It's illegal to behave in a way considered to offend Islam. For example, you must not encourage Muslims to convert to another religion.

In public women are required by law to wear:

* loose-fitting clothing to cover arms and legs
* a long coat
* a headscarf

If you fail to follow these dress requirements, you may be detained, fined or denied access to government and other services.

In public men should not wear shorts or sleeveless T-shirts.

#### Photography

You cannot photograph sensitive sites or events, including:

* military and nuclear sites
* government buildings and installations
* critical civil infrastructure
* public demonstrations

#### Electronic equipment

It's illegal to use drones without authorisation. The use of drones over military, police, security or sensitive areas may result in imprisonment.

You will need permission to bring in a range of electronic equipment, including:

* satellite phones
* GPS trackers
* walkie-talkies

Unauthorised use may result in arrest or detention. Tracking software installed on mobile phones, tablets or other computer equipment may attract the attention of authorities.

For advice, contact your nearest [Iranian embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/93).

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Iran doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, you may be at greater risk of arbitrary arrest or detention. Our ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited.

If you're arrested or detained, it's highly unlikely the Government of Iran would:

* allow us to give you [consular services](/consular-services "Our services")
* notify the Australian Embassy that you've been arrested or detained.

Under Iranian law, Iranian dual nationals must enter and exit Iran on their Iranian passport. Iranian immigration officials routinely confiscate the foreign and Iranian passports of dual nationals. Dual nationals will not be able to depart Iran without their Iranian passport.

If you're an Australian-Iranian dual national, authorities may not allow you to leave Iran if:

* you're male and you haven't completed military service
* you're female and you don't have permission from your husband or a senior male relative to leave Iran
* you're male and have not paid back the dowry to your wife after divorce

We advise you not to travel to Iran if you are dual Australian-US or Australian-Israeli citizen, in line with those countries' advice to their citizens. For other nationalities, you should check with the relevant country’s travel advice for advice about your risks.

#### Local customs

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event") is observed in Iran. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws during this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
