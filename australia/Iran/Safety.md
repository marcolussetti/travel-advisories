# Safety

#### Security situation

The Australian Government has directed the departure of Australian officials from the Australian Embassy in Tehran due to the volatile security situation. Our Embassy and operations in Tehran are now closed.

The security situation is unpredictable and could deteriorate further with little warning. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Iran is extremely limited. Australians in need of consular assistance should call the Australian Government 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia. 

We urge Australians who want to leave Iran to do so now, if it is safe. Australians in Iran who are unable to leave, or do not wish to leave, are advised to shelter in place. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. Continue to monitor advice on Smartraveller. 

If you're an Australian citizen or permanent resident in Iran, you can now register on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's [crisis registration portal](https://crisis.dfat.gov.au/). We will communicate directly with registered Australians with important updates.

Following military strikes in Iran, Australians in Iran should See our general advice on protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fstaying-safe%2Farmed-conflict&data=05%7C02%7CNick.Casey%40dfat.gov.au%7Cf7a16e079aae4d0a5d7a08ddaf319fe6%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638859349862342955%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=QE9kKbjy3JBq9HBcjm9MLOGV44ozJr8x4xdFgmyHsx0%3D&reserved=0)..  The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure.

If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice. See Travel for more information.

Iranian authorities are active in and closely monitor border areas with Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The security situation within 10km of the Iran-Iraq border is extremely dangerous.

Do not visit military or nuclear sites; these are not always clearly marked. Even if you did so inadvertently, you can get arrested for venturing close to or taking photos of sensitive sites. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Political developments in the region and local political tensions can trigger protests, demonstrations and vigils with little notice. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can potentially turn violent.

Some airlines may cancel flights at short notice in response to security developments - check with your airline.

In late 2022 and early 2023, there were widespread protests across many cities and towns in Iran. Previously, security forces' response to protests has been severe, and many protesters and bystanders have been injured, killed or detained. During past protest periods, there have been increases in the number of foreign nationals arrested. You should avoid all protest activity.

Iranians sometimes protest against some Western and Middle East embassies and UN missions.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests, large crowds and vigils
* do not photograph demonstrations, protests, large crowds or vigils
* monitor media for possible threats
* plan activities to avoid disruption on national or commemorative days
* follow the advice of local authorities
* share your itinerary with family and friends and keep in close contact so they know where you are.

Be prepared to change your plans in case of disruptions.

If civil unrest disrupts transport, ask your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Risk of arbitrary detention or arrest

Travellers in Iran, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. A number of Australians, including dual nationals, have been detained in Iran without due process of law.

There's been an increase in the number of foreign nationals being arrested or detained in Iran.

You may be at greater risk of detention if authorities are suspicious of your activities or background. You could attract the attention of authorities if you:

* study or do other academic activity
* travel outside tourist areas
* are near crowds, demonstrations or sensitive sites
* take photos, except in major tourist sites
* have contact with Iranians who are of interest to authorities
* behave or express views perceived as anti-Iranian, anti-Iranian Government, or that could cause religious offence, including on social media
* are affiliated with, or have links to, Iranian opposition or other political groups.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality. If you're a dual Australian-Iranian national and are detained in Iran, our ability to provide consular support is extremely limited.

The Australian Government may not be notified if you're detained. We can't guarantee consular access to any Australian detained or arrested. We also can't guarantee access to legal representation.

#### Terrorism

A terrorist attack could happen anywhere in Iran at any time, including in Tehran.

In January 2024, at least 84 people were killed and more than 200 wounded in suicide bombing attacks in Kerman, southern Iran, carried out by Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).

Possible targets for attacks include:

* embassies
* hotels
* places of worship
* tourist sites
* government interests
* military parades and locations
* Western businesses and other interests

To stay safe from terrorist risks:

* be alert to possible threats throughout the country
* avoid places where there is a low level of security and possible target areas
* monitor the media for new threats
* report suspicious activity or items to police
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack:

* leave the area as soon as it's safe
* avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping is a risk in Iran. Foreign nationals have been targeted. The kidnapping risk is heightened in the border areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan, including in the area east of Bam, Jask, and the Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. Terrorists, drug traffickers, smugglers and bandits are active in these regions.

Kidnapping happens with political, ideological and criminal motives.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to breach Australian anti-terrorism financing laws.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you're confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

Regularly reassess your security arrangements and carefully consider any travel. Using professional security providers is important, but does not completely protect you.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

The level of violent crime in Iran is generally low, but petty crime is increasing due to the worsening economic situation.

Terrorists, drug traffickers, smugglers and bandits are active in the border areas near Afghanistan and Pakistan. This includes:

* Sistan and Baluchestan province
* east of the city of Bam in Kerman province

Violent incidents often occur in these areas, such as:

* clashes between security forces and smugglers
* bombings
* shootings

Travel at night in these areas is particularly dangerous.

Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night. Don't draw unwanted attention to yourself.

#### Petty crime

There have been increasing reports of thieves in passing vehicles and on motor bikes snatching bags and mobile phones from pedestrians, home break-ins and robberies.

Women can face unwanted attention and harassment. [Women](/before-you-go/who-you-are/women "Advice for women travellers") should take care travelling alone, particularly at night.

#### Scams and fraud

Men may approach foreigners and claim to be plain-clothes police. They say they're looking for foreign drug dealers and ask to see wallets and ID.

If this happens, it could be a [scam](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers"). Ask a uniformed police officer for help.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

It is illegal to import, manufacture, sell or consume alcoholic drinks in Iran. There are no licensed commercial establishments that sell alcohol legally. Alcoholic drinks in Iran are unregulated and mostly homemade. Methanol poisoning incidents occur from time to time, resulting in serious injuries and deaths.

If, despite our advice, you decide to consume alcoholic drinks in Iran, be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on partying safely while overseas.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged. Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Earthquakes and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") occur in Iran.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") happens:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

#### Earthquakes

Iran is in an active seismic zone and experiences frequent [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"). There have been several major earthquakes in recent years.

Aftershocks often follow a major earthquake. They can cause further damage to already weakened structures.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Severe weather

Iran experiences extremely high temperatures.

The temperature in some areas can reach over 50˚C in July and August, the hottest months of the year.

Some regions have heavy snowfall during winter.

Sandstorms and dust storms occur regularly.

Flash flooding can occur, particularly in Spring.

#### Power outages

Power outages occasionally occur, especially in the summer, disrupting public water supply and telecommunication networks, including mobile and internet. 

Monitor the media for updates on changes that may affect your safety and access to essential services.
