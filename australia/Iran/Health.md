#### Travel insurance

If despite our advice you plan to travel to Iran, you'll need a specialised travel insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Iran. Check that Iran is not excluded from your cover because of sanctions or its travel advice level of 'do not travel'.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care. The Australian Government won't pay for any costs or organise evacuation.

If you can't get or afford [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149), you should not travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Some specialised medicines are in short supply in Iran.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Iran. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Medical evacuation may be difficult.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is endemic outside the major towns in Iran's south and west.

Other insect-borne diseases are common, including:

* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)
* [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tick-borne-encephalitis#tab=tab_1)

Ticks are most active in spring, summer and autumn.

To protect yourself from disease:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

HIV/AIDS is a risk.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur, such as:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical help if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Air pollution

Significant air pollution occurs in major cities. Sandstorms and dust storms occur regularly.

Get medical advice if you have allergies or breathing difficulties.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities varies. Facilities in remote areas are extremely limited.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities, such as London or Dubai. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and may not be possible.

#### Medical tourism

Medical tourism including for cosmetic operations is common in Iran. The standard of medical service providers can vary. If you're considering getting medical treatment in Iran, you should research and choose your medical service providers carefully. Serious post-surgery complications and deaths have occurred.

You should discuss your plans with your Australian doctor or specialist before committing to getting procedures done in Iran.
