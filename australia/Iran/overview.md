Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to Iran. The security situation in Iran and the region remains unpredictable. A ceasefire is currently in place. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of further military conflict.   
  
International flights from Iran have resumed, including from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport. Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. If you have an existing ticket, contact your travel provider or airline.  
  
We continue to encourage Australians who want to leave Iran to do so, if it is safe. Australians in Iran who are unable to leave, or do not wish to leave, are advised to take all precautions for your safety. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. While the current ceasefire is holding, the situation remains volatile and can change quickly (see ‘Safety’).   
  
Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. The risk of questioning may be increased at border crossings for dual Australian-Iranian nationals when trying to leave or enter Iran. Our ability to provide consular support to dual Australian-Iranian nationals is extremely limited. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested. If you’re a dual Australian-Iranian you must exit Iran on your Iranian passport. You should be prepared to encounter checkpoints and questioning from Iranian authorities before departing Iran. See ‘Security – Risk of arbitrary detention or arrest’.  
  
If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Iran’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign nationals and may close at short notice (see 'Travel').  
  
Avoid all demonstrations and protests, as well as visiting any recently damaged sites and locations as a result of recent hostilities. Do not take photographs of these sensitive sites as this could lead to arrest or detention. Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in Iran, including Tehran or other locations frequented by foreigners and tourists. Foreigners, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Kidnapping for ransom is a risk in Iran.  
  
The Australian Embassy in Tehran has re-opened but can only provide limited consular and passport assistance in Iran at this time.

## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation in Iran and the region remains unpredictable. A ceasefire is currently in place. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of further military conflict.
* International flights from Iran have resumed, including from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport. Contact your travel provider about flight availability. Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. If you have an existing ticket, contact your travel provider or airline.
* Australians in Iran should see our general advice on protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/staying-safe/armed-conflict).
* We encourage Australians who want to leave Iran to do so, if it is safe. Australians in Iran who are unable to leave, or do not wish to leave, are advised to take all precautions for your safety. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure.
* If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice.
* Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in Iran, including Tehran or other locations frequented by foreigners and tourists. They could occur at any time with little or no warning. Avoid possible targets and areas with a low level of security. Possible targets for attacks include embassies, hotels, places of worship, tourist sites, government interests, military parades and locations, Western businesses and other interests. Take official warnings seriously.
* The Australian Embassy in Tehran has re-opened but can only provide limited consular and passport assistance in Iran at this time. All in-person services are by appointment only (see 'Consular contacts').
* The Australian Government has offered voluntary departures for dependants of Australian officials from the Australian Embassy in Tehran due to the security situation.
* There is ongoing hostility between Iran and Israel and military tensions between Iran, the US and other countries in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq, Iran-Afghanistan, and Iran-Pakistan border areas can be volatile and remain extremely dangerous.
* Demonstrations and protests are expected. Small, local protests continue in parts of Iran. Previously, security forces' response to protests has been severe, and many protesters and bystanders have been injured, killed or detained. There has been an increase in the number of foreign nationals arrested during previous protests. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Foreign and dual nationals have been detained without due process of law. Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Our ability to provide consular support to dual Australian-Iranian nationals is extremely limited. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested.
* There are ongoing disruptions to telecommunications services, including mobile internet access.
* Regional and international politics can trigger protests. These may target Western or UN diplomatic missions. Avoid vigils, marches, demonstrations and large public gatherings, as they can turn violent without warning.
* Kidnapping can occur in Iran. Foreign nationals have also been the target of kidnapping. Terrorist groups, drug traffickers, smugglers and bandits are active in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border areas. They often clash violently with security forces. Bombings and shootings occur. Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night. Outside these areas, the level of violent crime is low.
* Women can face unwanted attention and harassment. If you're a woman, take care when travelling alone, particularly at night.
* It's illegal to drink alcohol in Iran. If, despite our advice, you decide to consume alcohol in Iran, be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning. Alcoholic drinks in Iran are unregulated and mostly homemade. Methanol poisoning incidents occur, resulting in serious injuries and deaths.

### Local laws

* Don't use, carry or import illegal drugs. Punishments for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty.
* Get professional advice if you're involved in local legal proceedings. In particular, seek advice on matters of family law, such as divorce, child custody and child support.
* Same-sex relations are illegal for both men and women. Penalties include corporal punishment and death.
* Iran has strict codes of dress and behaviour. Women are required by law to wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothing covering their arms and legs. Men face fewer clothing restrictions but should avoid shorts and sleeveless t-shirts. Close contact between unmarried men and women is illegal, as is being in a de facto relationship. This is particularly the case for interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims. It's against the law to behave in a way that offends Islam, such as encouraging a Muslim to convert.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military or government sites, critical civil infrastructure and public protests. It's illegal to use drones without authorisation. The use of drones over military, police, security or sensitive areas may result in imprisonment.
* Iran has strict importation laws. You can't import alcohol, pornography, pork products or short-wave radios. It's also illegal to import printed or recorded Western materials, including religious material. You'll need to get permission to bring in certain types of electronic equipment, such as satellite phones, GPS trackers and walkie-talkies.

* Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Iran. You'll need a specialised policy.
* The local currency is the Iranian Rial (IRR). Declare any foreign currency you have when you arrive in Iran or authorities may confiscate it when you leave.
