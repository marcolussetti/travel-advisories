## Overview

### Safety

* If you're an Australian citizen or permanent resident in Iran, you can now register on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's [crisis registration portal](https://crisis.dfat.gov.au). We will communicate directly with registered Australians with important updates.
* Following military strikes in Iran, Australians in Iran should shelter in place and take the advice of local authorities in affected areas. See our general advice on protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/staying-safe/armed-conflict). Airlines may cancel or reduce their operations to and from Iran at short notice and your options to leave may be limited. Check the latest flight status with your airline or travel provider. The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure.
* If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice. See Travel for more information.
* Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in Iran, including Tehran or other locations frequented by foreigners and tourists. They could occur at any time with little or no warning. Avoid possible targets and areas with a low level of security. Possible targets for attacks include embassies, hotels, places of worship, tourist sites, government interests, military parades and locations, Western businesses and other interests. Take official warnings seriously.
* Regional tensions are high and could escalate rapidly. There is ongoing hostility between Iran and Israel and military tensions between Iran, the US and other countries in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq, Iran-Afghanistan, and Iran-Pakistan border areas can be volatile and remain extremely dangerous.
* The security situation could continue to deteriorate rapidly. Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. If you're in Iran, you should depart when it's safe to do so.
* Due to the deteriorating security environment in Iran, the Australian Embassy remains closed. We urge Australians who want to leave Iran to do so now, if it is safe, otherwise shelter in place.
* The Australian Government has offered voluntary departures to Australia for dependants of Australian officials posted to Iran.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice.
* Demonstrations and protests are expected. Small, local protests continue in parts of Iran. Previously, security forces' response to protests has been severe, and many protesters and bystanders have been injured, killed or detained. There has been an increase in the number of foreign nationals arrested during previous protests. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Australians, including dual nationals, should strongly consider leaving Iran as soon as possible. Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Foreign and dual nationals have been detained without due process of law. Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Our ability to provide consular support to dual Australian-Iranian nationals is extremely limited. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested.
* There are ongoing disruptions to telecommunications services, including mobile internet access.
* Regional and international politics can trigger protests. These may target Western or UN diplomatic missions. Avoid vigils, marches, demonstrations and large public gatherings, as they can turn violent without warning.
* Kidnapping can occur in Iran. Foreign nationals have also been the target of kidnapping. Terrorist groups, drug traffickers, smugglers and bandits are active in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border areas. They often clash violently with security forces. Bombings and shootings occur. Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night. Outside these areas, the level of violent crime is low.
* Women can face unwanted attention and harassment. If you're a woman, take care when travelling alone, particularly at night.
* It's illegal to drink alcohol in Iran. If, despite our advice, you decide to consume alcohol in Iran, be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning. Alcoholic drinks in Iran are unregulated and mostly homemade. Methanol poisoning incidents occur, resulting in serious injuries and deaths.

### Local laws

* Don't use, carry or import illegal drugs. Punishments for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty.
* Get professional advice if you're involved in local legal proceedings. In particular, seek advice on matters of family law, such as divorce, child custody and child support.
* Same-sex relations are illegal for both men and women. Penalties include corporal punishment and death.
* Iran has strict codes of dress and behaviour. Women are required by law to wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothing covering their arms and legs. Men face fewer clothing restrictions but should avoid shorts and sleeveless t-shirts. Close contact between unmarried men and women is illegal, as is being in a de facto relationship. This is particularly the case for interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims. It's against the law to behave in a way that offends Islam, such as encouraging a Muslim to convert.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military or government sites, critical civil infrastructure and public protests. It's illegal to use drones without authorisation.
* Iran has strict importation laws. You can't import alcohol, pornography, pork products or short-wave radios. It's also illegal to import printed or recorded Western materials, including religious material. You'll need to get permission to bring in certain types of electronic equipment, such as satellite phones, GPS trackers and walkie-talkies.

You can get more information on Iranian visa and exit permit requirements from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrant Affairs.
* Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Iran. You'll need a specialised policy.
* The local currency is the Iranian Rial (IRR). Declare any foreign currency you have when you arrive in Iran or authorities may confiscate it when you leave. You can exchange major currencies in all big cities. You can't use international credit or bank cards. You can't transfer money using commercial banks or money transfer companies.
