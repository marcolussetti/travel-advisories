# Overview

Latest update

The security situation in Iran and the region is unpredictable. A ceasefire is currently in place. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of further military conflict.   
  
If you'd like to depart, commercial options to leave Iran are becoming available, including flights from Mashhad. Flights from other cities are expected to commence in the coming days. Contact your travel provider about air and land transport availability.  Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. If you have an existing ticket, contact your travel provider or airline. This may be the fastest way for you to reach your destination.  
  
We continue to urge Australians who want to leave Iran to do so now, if it is safe. Australians in Iran who are unable to leave, or do not wish to leave, are advised to take all precautions for your safety. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. While the current ceasefire is holding, the situation remains volatile and can change quickly. See our advice on safety during an armed conflict (see ‘Safety’).   
  
If you're an Australian citizen or permanent resident in Iran, you can register on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's crisis registration portal. Keep your registration details up to date so we can contact you (see 'Safety').   
  
If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice. You should consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route and you should make your own assessment whether it's safe for you to travel in current circumstances. This includes considering the security situation and the potential risks involved. If you are not confident in the safety and reliability of any departure option, shelter in place and follow the advice of local authorities. Transport routes may be disrupted. Roads may be crowded and exposed to security risks such a military action, rocket attacks and terrorism, as may border crossings. Iran’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign nationals and may close at short notice. See detailed information on border crossings in the ‘Overview’ section below.  
  
Avoid all demonstrations and protests, as well as visiting any recently damaged sites and locations as a result of recent hostilities. Do not take photographs of these sensitive sites as this could lead to arrest or detention. Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in Iran, including Tehran or other locations frequented by foreigners and tourists. Foreigners, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Kidnapping for ransom is a risk in Iran.  
  
The Australian Government has directed the departure of Australian officials from the Australian Embassy in Tehran due to the volatile security situation. Our Embassy and operations in Tehran are now closed. Our ability to provide consular assistance in Iran is extremely limited. Australians in need of consular assistance should call the Australian Government 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia.

## Overview

### Border crossings

Requirements for border crossings may change without notice. Check the latest public information from local authorities on entry requirements and border arrangements.

##### [Azerbaijan](/destinations/europe/azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")

For Australians travelling from Iran, Azerbaijan authorities have reopened the crossing on its southern border at Astara for 'exceptional' crossing by third-country nationals. 

We have worked with Azerbaijan authorities to clear the backlog of Australian border crossing code applications. If you have a crossing code, you can cross the Azerbaijan border during the holiday. Consular staff are at the border in Azerbaijan to assist as needed. 

You will need both a visa and a border crossing code to enter Azerbaijan. We must register your details with Azerbaijan authorities to get the border crossing code (for Australian passport holders, permanent residents and immediate family members). This is different to a visa. Contact the Australian Embassy in Türkiye ([consular.ankara@dfat.gov.au](mailto:consular.ankara@dfat.gov.au)). It can take up to 4 business days or longer for a border crossing code to be issued by Azerbaijan authorities.

For Australian citizens, you will need to provide your full name, passport number, your e-visa for Azerbaijan, and contact details for all individuals seeking to transit. If possible, send a scan of your Australian passport biodata page.

For Australian permanent residents, provide your full name, passport number, your e-visa for Azerbaijan, and contact details for all individuals seeking to transit. If possible, send a scan of your passport biodata page and proof of permanent residence in Australia.

Internet and telephone connectivity in Iran, including at the Azerbaijan border, can be very poor. We encourage you to pre-arrange onward transport and accommodation from the border to Baku. Baku has more services available and is closer to the international airport.

##### [Türkiye](/destinations/europe/turkiye "Türkiye")

You will need permission from Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enter Türkiye from Iran by land. You may be issued a transit visa with a maximum validity of five days for onwards travel. For assistance, contact the [Australian Embassy in Ankara](https://turkey.embassy.gov.au/). Border crossings at Gurbulak (Bazargan) in Agri province and Kapikoy (Razi) in Van province remain open to third country nationals holding a valid visa to enter Türkiye (Australians can apply online for e-visas).

##### [Armenia](/destinations/europe/armenia "Armenia")

The border crossing between Iran and Armenia is open at Agarak. Border crossings into a neighbouring country may open and close at short notice. Check the latest public information from local authorities on entry requirements and border arrangements. Australians do not need a visa for Armenia for stays of up to 180 days per year.  See our travel advice for Armenia for advice on safety concerns for some nearby Armenian border regions.

##### [Turkmenistan](/destinations/asia/turkmenistan "Turkmenistan")

The Iran-Turkmenistan border is open for humanitarian purposes, including for transit of foreign citizens in Iran. We are working with Turkmen authorities to facilitate humanitarian transit entry into Turkmenistan for Australian citizens. If you are an Australian citizen seeking humanitarian transit entry from Iran into Turkmenistan, contact the Australian Embassy in Moscow (see 'Travel' on our Turkmenistan page) and attach a copy of your Australian passport.  
  
Australians seeking to transit Turkmenistan must arrive at either Bajgiran or Artyk border crossing posts and must present a valid airline ticket with a departure time from Turkmenistan within 7 hours of your arrival at the land border. Details of your outward flight, and information on which crossing you will use, must be communicated to the Australian Embassy in Moscow in advance of your arrival at the border. If you arrive at the border more than 7 hours from your departure time from Turkmenistan, or without a valid airline ticket, you will be turned away.  
  
Requirements for border crossings from Iran may change without notice. Check the latest public information from local authorities on entry requirements and border arrangements.

Foreigners, including dual nationals, are at increased risk of questioning, arrest or detention in Iran. If you’re a dual Australian-Iranian you must exit Iran on your Iranian passport. You should be prepared to encounter checkpoints and questioning from Iranian authorities before departing Iran. See ‘Security – Risk of arbitrary detention or arrest’.

* The security situation in Iran and the region is unpredictable. A ceasefire is currently in place. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of further military conflict.
* Commercial options to leave Iran are becoming available, including flights from Mashhad. Flights from other cities are expected to commence in the coming days. Contact your travel provider about air and land transport availability.  Flight cancellations and disruptions could continue with little or no notice, including due to airport and airspace closures. If you have an existing ticket, contact your travel provider or airline. This may be the fastest way for you to reach your destination.
* Australians in Iran should see our general advice on protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/staying-safe/armed-conflict).
* Our ability to provide consular assistance in Iran is extremely limited. We urge Australians who want to leave Iran to do so now, if it is safe. Australians in Iran who are unable to leave, or do not wish to leave, are advised to take all precautions for your safety. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. The Australian Government may not be able to assist with your departure.
* If you're an Australian citizen or permanent resident in Iran, you can register on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's [crisis registration portal](https://crisis.dfat.gov.au). We will communicate directly with registered Australians with important updates.
* If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iran and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice.
* Terrorist attacks could happen anywhere in Iran, including Tehran or other locations frequented by foreigners and tourists. They could occur at any time with little or no warning. Avoid possible targets and areas with a low level of security. Possible targets for attacks include embassies, hotels, places of worship, tourist sites, government interests, military parades and locations, Western businesses and other interests. Take official warnings seriously.
* The Australian Government has directed the departure of Australian officials from the Australian Embassy in Tehran due to the volatile security situation. Our Embassy and operations in Tehran are now closed.
* Regional tensions are high and could escalate rapidly. There is ongoing hostility between Iran and Israel and military tensions between Iran, the US and other countries in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq, Iran-Afghanistan, and Iran-Pakistan border areas can be volatile and remain extremely dangerous.
* Demonstrations and protests are expected. Small, local protests continue in parts of Iran. Previously, security forces' response to protests has been severe, and many protesters and bystanders have been injured, killed or detained. There has been an increase in the number of foreign nationals arrested during previous protests. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Foreigners in Iran, including Australians, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest. Foreign and dual nationals have been detained without due process of law. Iran does not recognise dual nationality. Our ability to provide consular support to dual Australian-Iranian nationals is extremely limited. We can't guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you're detained or arrested.
* There are ongoing disruptions to telecommunications services, including mobile internet access.
* Regional and international politics can trigger protests. These may target Western or UN diplomatic missions. Avoid vigils, marches, demonstrations and large public gatherings, as they can turn violent without warning.
* Kidnapping can occur in Iran. Foreign nationals have also been the target of kidnapping. Terrorist groups, drug traffickers, smugglers and bandits are active in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border areas. They often clash violently with security forces. Bombings and shootings occur. Be alert to your surroundings, especially at night. Outside these areas, the level of violent crime is low.
* Women can face unwanted attention and harassment. If you're a woman, take care when travelling alone, particularly at night.
* It's illegal to drink alcohol in Iran. If, despite our advice, you decide to consume alcohol in Iran, be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning. Alcoholic drinks in Iran are unregulated and mostly homemade. Methanol poisoning incidents occur, resulting in serious injuries and deaths. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#:~:text=Look%20after%20your%20mates.,what%27s%20next%20from%20the%20perpetrator.).

### Local laws

* Don't use, carry or import illegal drugs. Punishments for drug offences are severe. They include the death penalty.
* Get professional advice if you're involved in local legal proceedings. In particular, seek advice on matters of family law, such as divorce, child custody and child support.
* Same-sex relations are illegal for both men and women. Penalties include corporal punishment and death.
* Iran has strict codes of dress and behaviour. Women are required by law to wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothing covering their arms and legs. Men face fewer clothing restrictions but should avoid shorts and sleeveless t-shirts. Close contact between unmarried men and women is illegal, as is being in a de facto relationship. This is particularly the case for interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims. It's against the law to behave in a way that offends Islam, such as encouraging a Muslim to convert.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military or government sites, critical civil infrastructure and public protests. It's illegal to use drones without authorisation.
* Iran has strict importation laws. You can't import alcohol, pornography, pork products or short-wave radios. It's also illegal to import printed or recorded Western materials, including religious material. You'll need to get permission to bring in certain types of electronic equipment, such as satellite phones, GPS trackers and walkie-talkies.

* If you overstay your visa in Iran for any reason, even one beyond your control, you'll incur a fine. The Australian Government cannot pay this fine for you. You must also apply for an exit visa. You can get more information on Iranian visa and exit permit requirements from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrant Affairs.
* Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Iran. You'll need a specialised policy.
* The local currency is the Iranian Rial (IRR). Declare any foreign currency you have when you arrive in Iran or authorities may confiscate it when you leave. You can exchange major currencies in all big cities. You can't use international credit or bank cards. You can't transfer money using commercial banks or money transfer companies. Bring enough cash in Euros or US Dollars to cover your stay.
