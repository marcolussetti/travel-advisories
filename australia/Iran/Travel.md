#### Border crossings from Iran

[Azerbaijan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/azerbaijan)

Azerbaijan authorities have reopened the crossing on its southern border at Astara for ‘exceptional’ crossing by third country nationals. If you wish to depart at this border we will need to register your details with Azerbaijan authorities for you to obtain a border crossing code (for Australian passport holders). We will communicate details to registered Australians. If accepted, you will still need visas to enter Azerbaijan. Australians require a visa which they should be able obtain online. Some travellers have been able to cross into Azerbaijan at Astara without this code.

[Türkiye](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/turkiye)

You will need permission from Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enter Türkiye from Iran by land. You may be issued a transit visa with a maximum validity of five days for onwards travel. For assistance, contact the [Australian Embassy in Ankara](https://turkey.embassy.gov.au/). Border crossings at Gurbulak (Bazargan) in Agri province and Kapikoy (Razi) in Van province remain open to third country nationals holding a valid visa to enter Türkiye (Australians can apply online for e-visas).

[Armenia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/armenia)

As of Monday, June 16, the land border with Armenia (at Agarak) was open.  Australians do not need a visa for Armenia for stays of up to 180 days per year.  See our travel advice for Armenia for advice on safety concerns for some nearby Armenian border regions.

[Turkmenistan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/turkmenistan)

Turkmenistan authorities have announced border crossings are open to allow the safe transit of foreign citizens from Iran. If you wish to depart at this border we will need to facilitate through Turkmenistan authorities (for Australian passport holders - see our advice for Turkmenistan). If approved, you will be issued with a transit visa for a period of up to 5 days.  Note internet, telephone and banking services can be unreliable in Turkmenistan, and onward flights and transport arrangements are best arranged from within Iran.  Note without prior approval by Turkmenistan authorities you will not be allowed to cross the border.

We continue to advise Do Not Travel to Afghanistan, Iraq or to the regions of Pakistan that border Iran.

#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visa

If despite our advice you decide to travel to Iran, you'll need a visa to enter. You must apply for a visa before you travel. Contact [Iranian embassy](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/93) in Australia to apply.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the embassy of Iran for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

The Government of Iran issues Iranian visas. The Australian Embassy can't intervene in visa matters, including visas on arrival.

If you overstay your visa in Iran for any reason, even one beyond your control, you'll incur a fine. The Australian Government cannot pay this fine for you. You must also apply for an exit visa. You can get more information on Iranian visa and exit permit requirements from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://en.mfa.ir/) and the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrant Affairs.

#### Travel to Israel

It's against Iranian law to travel to Israel.

If there's evidence that you've travelled to Israel or intend to, you will be refused entry to Iran and deported. You may be arrested and imprisoned. Evidence includes:

* Israeli exit or entry stamps in your passport
* Egyptian or Jordanian stamps from border crossings with Israel
* travel itineraries or tickets that include Israel as a destination
* souvenirs from Israel
* airline tags on your bags
* SIM cards, literature, or other items with obvious links to Israel

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas#i).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Iranian Rial (IRR).

Declare any foreign currency you have when you arrive in Iran. If you don't, authorities may confiscate it when you leave.

You can change major foreign currencies in all major cities. However, recent government action has made it harder to change money in exchange bureaus.

You can't use international credit or bank cards.

You can't transfer funds into Iran using:

* the commercial banking system
* a money transfer company

Bring enough cash in Euros or US Dollars to cover your stay.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Iran you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get an IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Iran has one of the highest rates of road accidents in the world.

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in Iran than in Australia. Road accidents are a common cause of death and injury.

Hazards include bad roads and poor driving standards.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have enough insurance cover
* ensure you understand local traffic laws and practices
* don't drink and drive

Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution when crossing roads, as traffic can be very congested and road-users unpredictable or undisciplined.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you for using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines. Book them through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Iran is serviced by extensive bus and rail options. Road conditions and road safety vary across the country. Rail services are more limited and slower. [Public transport](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport") in the main cities is often very crowded.

#### Sea travel

The Gulf has many areas with security issues and territorial disputes. Authorities may inspect, detain and arrest vessels. Foreigners navigating Iranian waters have been arrested and detained.

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") occurs in the Gulf.

Check the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy report](https://icc-ccs.org/map/).

#### Air travel

Due to ongoing tensions, the regional security situation could deteriorate quickly. This may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations, flight diversions, and other travel disruptions. 

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) hasn't audited air safety authorities in Iran.

The EU has operational restrictions in place for some of Iran Air's fleet. The airline hasn't met the EU's international safety standards.

Ageing planes on many of Iran's domestic air services create serious safety concerns.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check Iran's air safety profile with the [Aviation Safety Network](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EP).
