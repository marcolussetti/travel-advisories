### Safety

* Unexploded landmines remain a danger. Stay on main roads and avoid isolated mountain areas. Travel in daylight.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats. Terrorists may target tourist areas or crowded places such as music and cultural events, festivals, LGBTQIA+ community events, tourist areas and other public areas. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Earthquakes, flooding and landslides occur. Watch out for bush and forest fires in summer. Stick to marked slopes and trails when skiing. Follow the advice of local authorities.
