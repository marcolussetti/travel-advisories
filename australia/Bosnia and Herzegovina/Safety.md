# Safety

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Ethnic and religious tensions may result in demonstrations or conflict.

Events can happen with little or no warning and may target foreigners.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* monitor the media for updates
* avoid areas where protests may occur
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

The crime rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is moderate. Home and vehicle break-ins are common, particularly in Sarajevo. Pickpocketing and bag snatching is common. Take extra care in crowded tourist areas and on public transport.

Firearms are widely available. Travellers may not be targets, but you risk being in the wrong place at the wrong time, especially late at night.

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep your accommodation and car doors locked at all times
* don't go out alone after dark or to isolated places
* pay close attention to personal belongings, especially on public transport and in crowds
* use ATMs inside banks, shops and shopping centres and avoid ATMs on the street
* monitor the media for updates on areas with gun violence
* avoid known trouble areas
* avoid obvious displays of wealth and carrying large sums of cash

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can occur at popular nightclubs, sometimes leading to [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Unexploded weapons

Unexploded and unmarked landmines remain dangerous, particularly in the countryside and isolated mountainous areas.

To protect yourself:

* stay on main roads and paved surfaces
* avoid abandoned houses and buildings
* travel only during daylight hours
* do not touch war relics and unknown items - report these to local authorities.
* use an experienced guide if travelling off-road in rural areas
