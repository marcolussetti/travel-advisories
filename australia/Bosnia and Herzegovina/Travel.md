#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can't help you.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You don't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days.

You'll need a temporary residence permit if you plan to stay longer than 90 days.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/31) for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Other formalities

Ensure your passport is stamped when you enter the country. If it isn't stamped, you could face difficulties leaving.

For a stay of 3 days or more, you must register with the local police within 48 hours of arrival. Hotels can organise this for you and will confirm when you check in.

[Children](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") aged younger than 18 years old travelling alone or with one parent may need to produce the following:

* a letter of consent from the non-travelling parent or parents
* a copy of their birth certificate

Check with an [embassy or consulate of Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/31) before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/44).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the Bosnian Mark (KM or BAM).

You'll find ATMs in major centres.

While credit and debit card use is increasing, you'll still need cash outside Sarajevo.

Some banks will cash traveller's cheques for KM, but many won't accept them.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive a vehicle, you'll need both:

* a current Australian driver's licence
* a valid international driving permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance. Get your IDP before departing Australia.

The minimum age for driving is 18 years old.

#### Road travel

The [road traffic death rate](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.51310?lang=en) in Bosnia and Herzegovina is significantly higher than in Australia.

Driving can be dangerous due to:

* bad roads
* poor road lighting
* poorly maintained vehicles
* drivers ignoring road rules or driving under the influence of alcohol

Black ice, fog and landslides can make roads hazardous in winter and spring.

Avoid driving off-road in rural areas in case of landmines.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer if your policy covers you for riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Driver's insurance

You need the correct insurance cover to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina in a vehicle. If you don't, border police will direct you to an insurer at the border crossing to buy insurance.

If travelling by car, research and prepare before entry.

Not all border crossings have an insurer's office, and credit card payments aren't always possible.

#### Local traffic laws

You must always have your headlights on (even during the day).

From 1 November to 1 April, you must use winter tyres or tyres with snow chains.

The blood alcohol limit is 0.03%. For drivers younger than 21 or with less than 3 years of driving experience, the limit is 0%.

Police can collect traffic fines on the spot.

Ensure the meter is running throughout your trip. Pay particular attention at the airport.

#### Public transport

Public transport is usually reliable but can be crowded, and standards vary. Be wary of pickpockets.
