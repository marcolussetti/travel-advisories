# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe. Possessing even small amounts of illegal drugs can lead to prison sentences. This includes marijuana.

#### Australian laws

#### Dual citizenship

Bosnia and Herzegovina recognises dual nationality only in certain circumstances.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/node/44).

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/31) for advice on:

* your citizenship status
* local laws regarding access to consular help
