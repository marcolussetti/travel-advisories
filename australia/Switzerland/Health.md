#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

You may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care if you're not insured.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

You can only bring prescription and non-prescription medication into Switzerland if it's for personal use.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Switzerland. Take enough legal medication for your trip. Consider bringing extra supply in case your trip is unexpectedly extended. Leave medication in its original packaging when travelling.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Tick-borne encephalitis is present in some areas of Switzerland. Make sure you take precautions to prevent tick bites.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities and care is similar to that of Australia.

Switzerland doesn't have a reciprocal health care arrangement with Australia.

There are no public hospitals in Switzerland. Medical costs can be extremely high.

Hospitals, doctors and medical centres may ask for payment before treatment if you don't have medical insurance.
