#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Switzerland is part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries, meaning you can enter Switzerland without a visa in some cases.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Switzerland](https://www.eda.admin.ch/sydney) for the latest details about visas, currency and customs.

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports. ​

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to 

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements .

#### Other formalities

#### Travelling with children

The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) recommends that children under 18 travelling alone or with only one parent/guardian carry a letter of consent from their parents/guardians/non-travelling parent.

The letter should contain the following:

* the particulars of the parent(s)/guardian(s)
* dates of travel
* destination
* duration of travel/stay
* reason for travel
* a copy of the absent parent's passport or ID and contact details.

In cases where the second parent isn't present evidence of this should also be provided.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

Switzerland's currency is the Swiss Franc (CHF).

ATMs are widely accessible, and most major credit and debit cards are widely accepted.

#### Local travel

#### Borders

Check local media and ask transport providers for updates on border issues.

#### Driving permit

Drivers must:

* be at least 18 years old
* hold a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

Some car hire agencies may need you to have an International Driving Permit (IDP). Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

The standard of roads is generally high.

Pay attention to road conditions in winter.

Ask for local advice on using snow tyres and snow chains.

When driving, be aware that:  

* ​​vehicle headlights must be on at all times
* vehicles on motorways must display a valid car sticker — known as a vignette
* vehicles must have a warning triangle for use during breakdowns or accidents
* vehicles crossing into France, Germany and Italy must also carry a fluorescent safety vest
* vehicles must carry a first-aid kit

It's illegal to use a radar detector.

​Penalties for breaking these rules include significant on-the-spot fines.
