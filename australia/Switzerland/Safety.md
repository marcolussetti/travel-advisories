# Safety

#### Crime

Switzerland has low levels of serious crime.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, bag snatching, and pickpocketing are increasing. It regularly happens on public transport and in tourist areas.

Thieves may steal your belongings when your vehicle is unattended or stopped in traffic.

Tourists are a target for [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"):

* on all trains, particularly overnight trains, as they sleep
* near tourist attractions
* in major towns, including Bern, Zurich and Geneva
* at airports and railway stations

Crime rates increase in peak tourist seasons around summer and [Christmas](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event").

Criminals may operate at events with a large number of foreign visitors.

Thieves often work in pairs. One may distract you while the other steals from you.

To keep safe:

* ​​​don't leave bags unattended
* watch your things in tourist areas and on public transport

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Switzerland experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* avalanches
* storms and [flash flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* mudslides
* rock falls
* glacial crevasses
* sudden weather changes
* forest fires
* earthquakes

People have died.

The weather in Switzerland, particularly in alpine areas, is unpredictable. It can change suddenly. If there's a natural disaster, follow the advice of local authorities. Get the [Alertswiss](https://www.alert.swiss/) app and enable push notifications to get real-time weather warnings and advice about the impact of severe weather activity.

* get the right equipment
* plan your activities
* tell someone about your plans

Mountain rescues can be extremely costly. Check your travel insurance to ensure it covers you for planned activities.

#### Adventure activities

There are many [adventure activities](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure") in Switzerland. These include mountaineering, hiking, skiing and air sports. Check your travel insurance covers you for all planned activities.

#### Mountaineering and hiking

If you're mountaineering, hiking or skiing:

* monitor advice on weather and safety conditions
* don't move off marked slopes or trails

Hiking or mountain climbing without appropriate footwear (hiking boots) is dangerous. Stick to marked trails.

In some areas, authorities may arrest or prosecute you if you mountaineer or ski off marked trails.

#### Skiing and snowboarding

In addition to the above advice, be sure to follow posted etiquette rules as seen at ski resorts when skiing or snowboarding. If in doubt, check with the ticket sales office, tourist office or ski instructors. Failure to follow these rules and give priority to the right people can lead to accidents.

Skiing outside of prepared skiing areas is dangerous and may void your insurance. Stick to marked slopes and trails.

#### Air sports

These activities are always dangerous, even in Switzerland, where safety standards are generally high.

Always follow the advice of operators and instructors and wear all safety equipment correctly.

#### Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown in the rivers and lakes in Switzerland.

Most rivers have strong undercurrents and hidden debris. Due to the management of local dams, the undercurrents can vary significantly within short periods.

Lakes and rivers can be significantly colder than the air temperature, leading to thermal shock. Extended periods in any body of water can lead to fatigue.

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* regularly check weather reports
* take warnings seriously
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment and weather conditions before continuing with planned activities
* if possible, take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities

#### Wildlife safety

Wolves, wild boar, deer and cows with young calves are occasionally encountered in Switzerland. You should take particular care if you're in an area where they have been sighted. You should avoid these animals in the wild.
