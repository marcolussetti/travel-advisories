# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails.

#### Other laws

In some cases, it's illegal to photograph military and police:

* personnel
* establishments
* vehicles
* equipment

There may be signs indicating that photography is prohibited. If you're not sure, don't take photos.

Same-sex relationships are legal but not widely accepted. Avoid public displays of affection.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Montenegro doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're returning to Montenegro after many years, living conditions will be different from those in Australia.

Do your research before travelling.
