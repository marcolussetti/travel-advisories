#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Confirm what your policy covers, including in terms of activities, care, and health and travel disruptions. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Montenegro. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Contact DFAT to [authenticate](/consular-services/notarial-services "Notarial services") medical documents if needed.

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

There's a risk of [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) in forests and fields.

Ticks are common in country areas. They're active from spring to autumn.

Take measures to avoid tick bites, particularly in rural areas.

During and after visiting a forest:

* check your body for ticks
* carefully remove any whole ticks as soon as possible
* be alert for any signs of infection.

#### Other health risks

Outbreaks of foodborne and other infectious diseases happen from time to time. These include:

* rotavirus enteritis
* measles
* acute enterocolitis
* salmonella
* infective mononucleosis
* enterobiasis

To protect yourself from illness, avoid the following:

* raw and under-cooked food, such as salads
* unpasteurised dairy products
* get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited and below Australian standards.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
