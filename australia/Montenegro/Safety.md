# Safety

#### Civil ​unrest and political tension

Demonstrations, protests, rallies and political events are common.

Public protests, disturbances and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. They may also lead to road closures, including major roads.

Be cautious travelling in the Kosovo border area. The security situation is unpredictable.

The use of fireworks and firearms at public celebrations can result in injury.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor the local media for possible updates
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common. Take care in crowded places, markets and on public transport.

Credit card fraud is common.

To reduce your risk of crime:

* look after your belongings
* keep your credit card in sight during transactions and protect your PIN
* monitor the media for news about local crime

#### Sexual assault and violent crime

Violent criminal acts involving tourists can occur, including sexual assault, assault and robbery.

Serious crime is usually linked to organised crime and not often directed at foreigners.

Gun violence is a risk to bystanders, including travellers.

To protect yourself from violence:

* always pay attention to your safety
* be alert to suspicious behaviour
* remove yourself from potentially dangerous situations
* monitor the media for new security risks

#### Bars and nightclubs

Be alert in bars and nightclubs. Drink-spiking and snatching of valuables may occur if you're not vigilant.

Drinks may be contaminated with drugs or toxic substances.

Don't leave your food or drinks unattended.

Never accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from people you've just met.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Montenegro experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

Large [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") are rare, but tremors are common.

[Flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") can happen during winter and spring due to heavy rains and melting snow.

[Bush and forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") are common during summer, from April to October.

Extreme hot and dry periods can lead to water shortages.

Snow and ice can be a hazard on the roads. Roads aren't always cleared, even after heavy snowfalls during the winter months, from October to March.

To protect yourself if you encounter a natural disaster or severe weather:

* follow the advice of local authorities
