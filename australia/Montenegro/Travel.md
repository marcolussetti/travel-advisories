#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

You can stay for up to 90 days in 6 months without a tourist visa from the date of entry into Montenegro.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/134) of Montenegro for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

Register your local address with the police or a tourist organisation within 24 hours of arrival.

Registration is usually part of the hotel check-in procedure. If they don't do this, or you're staying in a private home, register at the nearest police station.

Authorities may fine or detain you if you don't register.

If you want to extend your stay beyond 90 days, apply for a Temporary Residence Permit.

You can apply for the permit at a police station in the district where you're staying.

Check the [Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior](https://www.gov.me/en/mup) for details or contact the Montenegro Border Protection Police at +382 20 224491 on weekdays from 7am to 3pm.

You must always carry a valid ID, such as a driver's licence or passport. You might be fined if you can't show your ID to local authorities.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government doesn't set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or damaged, apply for a Commonwealth emergency travel document at the [British Embassy](https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-podgorica/office/british-embassy) in Podgorica.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Euro.

You must declare cash and valuables valued over 10,000 euros or equivalent on arrival. This includes laptop computers, cameras and jewellery.

ATMs accept cards with Plus, Cirrus or Maestro access and are widely available.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in Montenegro, you'll need both:

* a valid Australian driver's license (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous due to the following:

Snow and ice can be a hazard in winter.

Moraca Canyon Road is dangerous due to traffic congestion and poor road conditions.
