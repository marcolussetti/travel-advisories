# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

**LGBTQIA+ travellers**

Uganda's law prohibits same-sex relationships, and convictions under these laws may result in severe sentences, up to the death penalty for certain cases. Same-sex public displays of affection, like kissing in public places, could lead to arrest and imprisonment. Groups, individuals, or legal entities advocating for LGBTQIA+ rights or promoting homosexuality could lead to arrest and long-term imprisonment. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community may face discrimination, potential violence and abuse.

LGBTQIA+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uganda.

#### Drugs

There are heavy penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs.

If you're convicted of a drug offence, you'll face a long jail sentence and heavy fines.

#### Surrogacy

If you plan to take part in commercial or altruistic surrogacy arrangements in Uganda, be aware of all legal and other risks involved.

Although it is not illegal, surrogacy is not regulated by law in Uganda. Get comprehensive and independent legal advice from a Ugandan lawyer with specialisation in this area of law.

Research prospective agencies and clinics to ensure you’re dealing with a reputable organisation.

Same-sex couples may encounter issues when engaging in surrogacy arrangements in Uganda.

The Australian High Commission can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics or agencies
* translation/interpretation services

You may need to spend several months in Uganda before and after the birth. Don’t confirm travel plans until you’ve finalised Australian citizenship and passport processes. This means: 

* you may miss family, work, or business commitments
* if you take prescription medication, take more than you think you will need
* have funds available to extend your stay if needed
* mentally prepare yourself for an extended stay in Uganda.

#### Other laws

Treason and murder carry the death penalty.

Rape and robbery attract corporal punishment.

In Uganda, it's illegal to:

* take photos of military, government and diplomatic buildings and areas
* wear military-style or camouflage civilian clothing

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
