# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

**LGBTQIA+ travellers**

Uganda's law prohibits same-sex relationships, and convictions under these laws may result in severe sentences, up to the death penalty for certain cases. Same-sex public displays of affection, like kissing in public places, could lead to arrest and imprisonment. Groups, individuals, or legal entities advocating for LGBTQIA+ rights or promoting homosexuality could lead to arrest and long-term imprisonment. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community may face discrimination, potential violence and abuse.

LGBTQIA+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uganda.

#### Drugs

There are heavy penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs.
