#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat in Uganda. Foreigners may be targeted in attacks.

Uganda has increased security arrangements in public places.

This includes borders and at the international airport.

Expect body, car and luggage checks when travelling, especially in Kampala.

Recent terrorist attacks have resulted in fatalities and injuries, including in Kampala and Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda.

Possible targets for terror attacks include:

* large gatherings, including large-scale worship services, and music and cultural festivals
* tourist areas, hotels, resorts restaurants, bars, clubs, marketplaces, markets and shopping centres
* schools, places of worship, outdoor and political events
* airports, bus terminals, public transport and government buildings

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* avoid visiting locations that are possible terrorist targets
* consider the level of security at venues you're visiting
* be alert in crowded places and monitor local media
* pay close attention to your personal security
* take official warnings seriously and follow official instructions

Report any suspicious items or activities to police.

If there's a terrorist attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so.

Avoid the affected area afterwards as there may be further attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
There’s a risk of kidnapping in Uganda, including in the capital Kampala. Kidnappings are usually criminally motivated and target the local population. The risk of kidnapping is higher in the border regions with DRC and South Sudan.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Political and other demonstrations can become violent without warning, causing loss of life and injury. Police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. You should take great care and avoid all demonstrations and rallies where possible.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid large gatherings, political rallies and demonstrations
* monitor the media
* avoid affected areas
* follow advice from local authorities

**More information:**

* [Demonstrations and civil unrest](/before-you-go/safety/protests-civil-unrest "Protests and civil unrest")

#### Border violence

It's extremely unstable in the neighbouring DRC. Cross-border attacks by rebel groups can happen without notice, and it's volatile. You may be at risk of attack by armed bandits in border areas North and South of Lake Albert.

Tourist areas, including Rwenzori Mountains and national parks, are near the border.

The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is no longer active in Uganda but remains active in the DRC and Central African Republic.

Clashes between tribal groups can occur without warning in the Karamoja region of north-eastern Uganda. Hotspots include districts north of Kate Kyoga:

* Kotido
* Moroto
* Nakapiripirit
* Katakwi

There's a risk of inter-tribal violence and armed bandits.

Uncleared landmines are still a danger.

**Gorilla trekking**

Security is usually required when gorilla trekking in:

* Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
* Mgahinga Gorilla Park
* other parts of western Uganda

You're at risk of armed attacks in those regions.

Travellers have been subject to violence. The security situation can change with little warning.

For your safety, don't take gorilla trekking tours that cross into the DRC.

Fly rather than drive if you travel to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park or Mgahinga Gorilla Park.

#### Crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crime happens, especially on public transport.

Theft from vehicles stuck in heavy traffic or stopped at traffic lights is common.

[Armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and carjacking is a risk, especially outside Kampala.

Home burglaries can turn violent.

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep car windows up and doors locked when moving
* lock doors and windows at your accommodation
* don't walk in isolated areas or along dark streets at night
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you or in ways that make them harder to snatch
* keep your passport, bank cards and money separately
* never leave your bags unsupervised at a ticket office or a registration desk
* don’t carry large sums of money if you can avoid it.

#### **Scams**

Financial [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") exist in Uganda.

If you fall victim to a scam, it could be dangerous to go to Uganda to try to get your money back.

Fake internet friendship, dating and marriage scams operate globally, including from some African countries.

Once an online friendship develops, you'll probably be asked by your 'friend' or planned marriage partner to send money. This is so the 'friend' can travel to Australia or make something else possible.

Sometimes the relationship ends with very little chance of getting your money back.

Other times your 'friend' or planned partner will ask you travel to Africa to meet them. If you do this, you could be [kidnapped](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping"), [assaulted](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas") or [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Credit card fraud is also a risk.

To avoid becoming a victim of a scam:

* check all online offers from people in Uganda, or people you don't know
* take legal advice before agreeing to anything
* don't send money to anyone in Uganda until proper checks are made
* get legal advice if you're the victim of a scam
* keep your credit card in sight when making transactions

Don't travel to Uganda to try to get your money back.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as white-water rafting.

If you plan to do a tour or [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* only use respected and registered tour operators
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### National parks

Some of Uganda's national parks have security risks. Many parks in western Uganda are situated within 50 kilometres of the border with DRC, where you should reconsider your need to travel.

For advice on security risks, park fees and other conditions in national parks, contact the [Uganda Wildlife Authority](http://www.ugandawildlife.org/).

If you plan to visit a national park:

* think about the security risks
* obey all park rules
* follow the advice of local authorities and park wardens
* use a registered tour operator

#### Swimming safety

Don't swim in lakes and rivers. Hippos and crocodiles inhabit many lakes and rivers and are extremely dangerous.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Uganda can experience [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* landslides

The rainy seasons are from March to May, and October to November.

Flooding can cause landslides, leaving people without homes and blocking roads.

To protect yourself if a natural disaster occurs:

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* closely monitor local media
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with friends and family
