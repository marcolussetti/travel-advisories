## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a threat in Uganda. Attacks have caused many deaths and serious injuries. Foreigners may be targeted. Avoid large gatherings, including large-scale worship, and music and cultural festivals. Terrorists may also target hotels, bars, restaurants and other tourist areas. Uganda has increased security arrangements in public places due to terrorist attacks. Expect body, car and luggage checks when travelling. Take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of authorities.
* Violent political protests can occur quickly, and there's potential for tension or politically motivated incidents across Uganda.
* Security is usually required when gorilla trekking due to the risk of armed attack. For your safety, don't take gorilla trekking tours that cross into the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
* Petty crime and violent crime can happen. Always be alert. Don't walk in isolated areas or along dark streets at night. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).
* There’s a risk of kidnapping in Uganda. The security situation in neighbouring DRC is very unstable and volatile. You may be kidnapped or caught up in violence. Reconsider your need to travel within 50 kilometres of the border with DRC (excluding the Eastern shores of Lake Albert). If you're travelling near the border, seek professional security advice.

### Health

* There’s currently an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Uganda. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone with Ebola virus disease.
* There's currently an outbreak of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.
* Many medications are in short supply or not available in Uganda. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.
* Yellow fever and malaria are common. Other insect-borne diseases can occur. Make sure your accommodation is insect proof. Use insect repellent.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases in Uganda include cholera, typhoid, hepatitis and mpox. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has mpox.
* Medical facilities are very limited outside Kampala. If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to another country. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Uganda prohibits same-sex relationships, and convictions may result in severe sentences. Same-sex public displays of affection, like kissing in public places, could lead to arrest and imprisonment. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community may face discrimination, potential violence and abuse. LGBTQIA+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Uganda.
* There are severe penalties for the possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs. If you're convicted, you'll face a long jail sentence and heavy fines.
* Serious crimes can attract the death penalty or corporal punishment.
