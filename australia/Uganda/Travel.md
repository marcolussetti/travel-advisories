#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to visit Uganda.

The East African Community's EAC Tourist Visa allows travellers multiple entries to Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda for 90 days. Another option is to apply for a visa from the Government of Uganda. Apply for the EAC Tourist Visa or a Ugandan visa by using Uganda's [online visa application](https://visas.immigration.go.ug/).

#### Border measures

Check the [entry requirements of the destinations](/destinations) you're travelling to or transiting.

Ensure you review and comply with testing and health screening requirements for any transit and destination countries. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Uganda. Some airlines may want to see a certificate when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Ugandan Shilling (UGX).

You must declare all foreign currency on arrival. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. If you don't, you may have trouble taking it when you leave.

Only exchange money at commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

US dollars are widely accepted. You may not be able to change US banknotes printed before 2006.

You will probably need cash in Uganda. However, some larger stores, restaurants and hotels, especially in tourist areas, may accept card payments.

#### Local travel

#### Local restrictions

For the latest information on Ebola outbreaks, follow the advice issued by the [Government of Uganda](https://health.go.ug/) and monitor the local media.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Uganda, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Traffic accidents are common and there's a high risk at night.

Hazards include:

* poor road and vehicle conditions
* bad driving habits
* high speeds
* poor lighting

The Ugandan Government sometimes closes tourist areas if there's a risk of rebel activity.

If you plan to drive in Uganda:

* check local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to possible hazards, especially at night
* check security risks and road closures before you travel outside major centres
* don't travel between towns after dusk, except between Kampala and Entebbe

The border between Uganda and Rwanda regularly closes for extended periods.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and limousines due to the high risk of crime. It's best to arrange this through your hotel.

Don't use unofficial taxis or hail taxis on the street. You could be robbed.

#### Public transport

Long-distance bus travel can be dangerous. Accidents are common.

Some buses travelling overnight have been robbed. They have been forced to stop by roadblocks or by criminals acting as passengers.

Minibuses ('matatus') and scooter taxis (boda-boda) are usually in poor condition and badly driven.

If you need to take public transport, don't use matatus and boda-bodas. If you do take a boda-boda,   
always wear a helmet.
