# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks are possible in India anywhere and at any time.

The Australian Government continues to receive reports that terrorists are planning attacks in India.

The Indian Government regularly issues public alert warnings about possible terrorist attacks.

Terrorist attacks could target foreigners. Violence directed at others may affect you.

Terrorists have targeted popular tourist areas, including:

* hotels, markets and cinemas
* restaurants, bars and cafes
* tourist and religious sites
* transport hubs and public transport networks
* sporting events
* local courts and Indian security and political establishments

Targets could also include major tourist attractions and shopping centres.

Attacks could happen during significant times such as:

* Republic Day, 26 January
* Independence Day, 15 August
* periods of religious significance
* other major holidays - noting each state has different holidays

Many terrorist attacks in India have involved multiple explosions, one after the other. These attacks have caused a high number of deaths.

Militants have crossed the border into India to conduct attacks in the past. This will likely continue.

Attacks on the military and police in Jammu and Kashmir often lead to violent clashes.

Outside of major cities, security on public transport is limited, including on buses and railways.

Security at airports has improved due to the threat of terrorist attacks against Indian aviation interests.

To protect yourself from terrorist attacks:

* check the media for threats
* take official warnings seriously
* consider the level of security at your destination
* avoid areas that are possible terrorist targets
* have a clear exit plan for crowded places and potential targets
* report suspicious activity or items to the police

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks. Security officials may disable phone services when the threat of an attack is imminent, or directly after an incident.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Jammu and Kashmir

A heightened Indian security presence is in place, with additional restrictive measures applying to public gatherings and internet and telecommunications services. Monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

In the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir there is a high risk of:

* terrorist attacks
* violent demonstrations

There is a higher risk in rural areas and areas close to the border with Pakistan.

Terrorists have kidnapped foreigners in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorists have also targeted tourist buses.

People have been killed and seriously injured in widespread violent protests. More police have been sent to the region.

#### Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana

Maoist insurgents, known as Naxalites, have attacked rural and forested areas of the state of Chhattisgarh.

There is a risk of Naxalite violence in border regions of:

* Odisha
* Jharkhand
* Maharashtra
* Andhra Pradesh
* Telangana

#### Borders with Pakistan

Parts of the India-Pakistan border have a high risk of:

* landmines
* cross-border attacks
* violence

Always be alert to possible threats near the Atari-Wagah border crossing.  The Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari Border has been closed with immediate effect.

#### Manipur

Curfews and restrictions have been imposed in parts of Manipur following violent demonstrations, resulting in casualties. Security agencies have increased their presence in the region. Mobile data, internet and transport services continue to be affected. Further restrictions may be imposed at short notice. If you are in Manipur, you should consider leaving if it's safe to do so. Monitor local media for updates, follow the advice of local authorities and take official warnings seriously.

#### Nagaland

The north-eastern states of Nagaland have a high risk of:

* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* extortion
* separatist and insurgent violence

Insurgent groups have:

* attacked civilians
* bombed buildings

#### Assam

Assam's border districts of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Charaideo and Sivasagar are classified as 'disturbed areas' under the Indian Government's Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). There is a high risk of internal law and order disruption from separatist and insurgent violence in these areas.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

There have been incidents of kidnappings in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and the Northeastern Region.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements, and don't set patterns
* don’t display money or valuables in public
* notify family or friends of planned travel, and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* always use licensed taxi services

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Due to the current security situation between India and Pakistan, we recommend you monitor local media for updates, stay alert, take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities. There may be flight disruptions. Some airports in India (particularly in the north west) may close, and airline schedules may be affected. Check with your airline before arriving at the airport.

We continue to advise do not travel to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the entire India-Pakistan border, or Manipur. This doesn’t apply to the Union Territory of Ladakh, which was established as its own union territory of India in October 2019, separate from the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. India has closed the Attari border crossing with Pakistan.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Violent protests and demonstrations occur from time to time. They can happen with little or no warning.

Many people have died due to civil unrest and communal violence in India.

Triggers for demonstrations include:

* international events
* political developments in the region
* election periods
* local events

Demonstrations may affect public transport.

Large crowds at religious ceremonies and gatherings can be dangerous. They have led to life-threatening situations such as stampedes.

Indian authorities may:

* set curfews
* limit mobile network availability
* restrict activity

To protect yourself from civil unrest and violence:

* avoid demonstrations, political events, rallies, processions and large public gatherings
* check the news and other sources for information
* avoid areas affected by civil unrest
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities
* plan your activities to avoid days of national and commemorative significance

Be prepared to change your travel plans if there's an incident.

If you're affected by transport disruptions, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Crime

#### Sexual assault

Women in India may experience:

* unwanted attention
* harassment
* [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault)
* [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault)

It is rare for people who commit these crimes to be successfully prosecuted by the law.

There are consistent, ongoing allegations and reports of sexual misconduct. These reports have involved religious groups and their leaders. If you're visiting India for religious reasons, find out about your hosts before travelling.

Avoid travelling alone if you're female, even in major cities and tourist sites.

Many travellers have been robbed and assaulted after consuming spiked drinks or food.

#### Petty crime

Petty theft is common in crowded areas such as:

* markets
* trade fairs
* expos
* airports and train stations
* public transport, including overnight and long-distance trains

Thieves on motorcycles snatch bags and jewellery.

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* pay close attention to your personal belongings, especially in crowded areas
* keep car doors locked, windows up, and valuables out of sight, when parked and when moving
* carry only what you need, including your passport
* leave valuables in a secure location
* avoid wearing expensive watches, jewellery and cameras
* avoid carrying bags that are easy to snatch

If you're walking, stay on footpaths, if possible, and:

* away from the kerb
* with your bag held away from traffic

Avoid travelling alone, especially at night:

* on public transport
* in cars, taxis and rickshaws

Avoid less populous and unlit areas. This includes city streets, village lanes and beaches.

#### Scams

[Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") in India can involve:

* ATM and credit cards
* train tickets
* taxis
* temple donations
* tour guides

#### Tour guide scams

Tour guides attempt to sell fraudulent tour packages. Some guides may try to 'prove' that your existing tour package is invalid to sell you their package.  
  
Strangers posing as 'guides' may attempt to take travellers to tourist areas. The fake guide transports the victim to an isolated area, where they then attempt to rob and assault them.   
  
Check that any person holding a placard with your name knows where you are going.

#### Card skimming scams

Card skimming devices copy details from the magnetic strip on your ATM and credit cards. These details are transferred onto a blank card for the criminal to use. There is a high risk of card skimming at ATMs.

To avoid credit and debit card scams:

* keep your credit card in sight at all times
* don't show your PIN to others, especially when using ATMs
* check your transaction statements

#### Government services scams

Touts or agents near government offices tell foreigners they can provide faster services for a fee. They may be present around places such as the Foreigner Regional Registration Office.

#### Reporting scams

If you're the victim of a scam report it immediately to the nearest police station. You may not be able to get your money or goods back. However, the police can give you an official report so you can make a claim with your insurer. See [Local contacts.](#local-contacts)

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations with social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Many travellers have been robbed and assaulted after consuming spiked drinks.

Home-made or unlabelled alcohol can be poisonous.

Drink spiking incidents have occurred:

* on public transport
* in hotels, restaurants and bars

To protect yourself from drink spiking:

* don't accept drinks from strangers
* don't leave drinks unattended
* if you're not certain your drink is safe, don't drink it

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate

#### Tours and adventure activities

Touts may use aggressive tactics to persuade you to buy tickets for tours. You'll often see them at:

* airports
* railway stations
* bus stations

They may not have any connection to tour services. You may be overcharged.

Businesses don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes:

* transport
* tour operators
* adventure activities

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check the credentials of the operator
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Wildlife safety

Tigers attack and kill people in India.

Monkeys may attempt to steal items from people at temples and busy tourist attractions.

If you plan to observe or photograph wildlife:

* always respect wildlife laws and park regulations
* only use reputable and professional guides
* keep a safe distance

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Severe weather

India experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* heatwaves and drought
* [floods](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and landslides
* [cyclones](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and storms
* dust storms
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

If there's a natural disaster:

* always carry your passport in a waterproof bag
* keep in touch with family and friends
* check the media, the [India Meteorological Department](https://mausam.imd.gov.in/) website and other local sources for information
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Heatwaves and drought

The climate in India is varied.

Heatwaves can cause droughts and water shortages in summer.

#### Floods and landslides

Monsoon rains occur. The highest risk is from June to October.

Monsoon rains can cause:

* extensive flooding and landslides
* disruptions to transportation
* areas to be cut off from roads for many days
* disruption to services, including phone, internet and electricity

High-risk areas include:

* Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the north and east
* Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in the south

Floods have affected millions of people and caused many deaths.

If you're travelling during monsoon season, ask your tour operator if services have been affected.

#### Cyclones and storms

Cyclones are common in Indian waters from April to December. They are particularly common around the Bay of Bengal in eastern India.

Coastal and some inland areas are vulnerable to storm surges, particularly:

* Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
* Kerala
* Lakshadweep
* the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
* Western India (Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat)

Cyclones and storms can disrupt critical services, including:

* emergency and medical care
* telecommunications
* transport
* food and water supplies

If there's a cyclone or storm:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended
* available flights may fill quickly
* adequate shelter may not be available

If you arrive during the wet season, contact your tour operator to check if services are affected.

#### Dust storms

Dust storms occur during summer and have caused deaths.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earth tremors are common in India, particularly in the north-eastern states.

Earth tremors can cause landslides in hilly and mountainous areas.

If there is an earthquake, expect severe disruptions to services.

To stay safe during an earthquake:

* know the emergency plans at your accommodation
* follow the instructions and advice of local authorities
* follow evacuation orders

All oceanic regions of the world can experience tsunamis. However, the Indian and Pacific Oceans experience large, destructive tsunamis more often. Be alert to warnings. A tsunami could quickly follow a tremor or earthquake.

Move to high ground straight away if:

* local authorities advise you to
* you feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* you feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* you see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* you hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media and weather services.
