#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa requirements

You must apply for a visa before arrival. Check if you're eligible for an e-visa on the [Indian Visa Online](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html) website. For information regarding other visa categories or entry and exit requirements, see the [Indian High Commission in Australia](https://www.hcicanberra.gov.in/) website.     
For information and advice regarding Indian visas and immigration regulations while in India, see the [FRRO/FRO](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp) and the [Bureau of Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/) websites.

If your visa has expired or you have overstayed your visa, make sure you regularise your immigration status with the [FRRO/FRO](https://indianfrro.gov.in/frro/) before you seek to travel. Immigration authorities may prevent you from leaving India on an expired visa.

If you have had a baby born in India, you'll need to inform the [FRRO](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/) about the child's birth and that you will be applying for an Australian citizenship and a passport for the child. Don't delay in securing appropriate travel documents and an Indian visa to remain legally in the country or to travel. Failure to inform the FRRO could result in a significant financial penalty.

#### Electronic visas

You may be eligible for an Electronic Visa (e-Visa) for:

* tourism
* business
* medical reasons

Get your e-Visa before travelling. You will not be able to get a visa on arrival. 

Check that you're eligible before you apply. See the Government of India's [Indian Visa Online](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html) website for details.

#### Tourist e-Visa

Indian Tourist e-Visas can be granted for 30 days, one year or five years. Additional conditions regarding the maximum length of stay may apply depending on the nationality shown on your passport. Detailed information regarding your visa validity and the maximum length of stay for each visa category can be found on the [Indian Visa Online](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html) and [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/foreigners-division/foreigners-tourists-and-visa) websites.

Beware of fake websites offering e-Visa services.

Carry a printed copy of your e-Visa, known as an electronic travel authorisation (ETA).

You'll get a formal visa in your passport when you arrive in India.

Long queues are common at immigration counters in India, regardless of visa type.

Not all international airports in India allow passengers to enter with an e-Visa. Check with your nearest [Indian consulate, embassy](http://www.mea.gov.in/indian-missions-abroad-new.htm#A) or agent and organise a visa before you arrive.

If you present an e-Visa at an entry point where the e-Visa is not recognised, you:

* won't be able to apply for any other visa
* won't be allowed to enter India
* will be deported

If you have an e-Visa, you can leave India from any authorised immigration checkpoint.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries require you to have at least 6 months of validity remaining on your passport after the date you plan to leave. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

Cash shortages at ATMs can be a problem in rural areas.

Traveller's cheques are not widely accepted.

Counterfeit currency is in circulation. Take care when dealing with cash.

#### Local travel

#### Travel delays

Travel delays are common.

Expect delays around days of national significance, including:

* Republic Day, 26 January
* Independence Day, 15 August

Fog often affects northern India, particularly during December and January. Fog may cause:

* delays to air and rail travel
* dangerous road travel conditions

#### Travel restrictions

You may need permission from Indian authorities to visit areas designated as 'restricted' or 'protected', particularly in the north-east.

Some state and union territory governments restrict foreigners from travelling around these areas. Additional permission may be required for foreigners born in certain countries. This also applies to Australians born in those countries, even if travelling on an Australian passport.

There are heavy penalties for entering a protected or restricted area without permission.

The Ministry of Home Affairs has temporarily excluded the following areas from the Protected Area regime. Visit [the Bureau of Indian Immigration](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/pages/ea8303e5-a167-48cb-857a-31b475fe7575) webpage for details.

* Manipur
* Mizoram
* Nagaland

If you plan to visit a protected or restricted area or to confirm if additional requirements apply to your circumstances:

* seek advice from an [embassy or consulate of India](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/91) or the [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://www.mha.gov.in/en/divisionofmha/foreigners-division/foreigners-tourists-and-visa)
* apply at least 4 weeks in advance

#### Driving permit

You can drive without an Indian driver's licence for 3 months if you have both:

* an International Driving Permit
* your current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

Your licence must be valid for the type of vehicle you are driving.

You need an Indian driver's licence if you plan to drive in India for over 3 months.

Your insurance may be void if you have an accident without the correct licence. You could be liable for the accident as an unlicensed driver.

#### Road travel

Travelling by road in India can be dangerous. Accidents are common.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained vehicles
* poor quality and congested roads
* roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock
* vehicles travelling in the wrong direction, often without warning

Travelling by road at night is particularly dangerous due to:

* insufficient or non-existent lighting
* other vehicles driving with headlights off or on high beam

If you hit a pedestrian or cow, you're at risk of being attacked or becoming a victim of extortion, even if you weren't driving the vehicle.

If it's unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident, go to the nearest police station.

To stay safe when driving:

* avoid driving at night
* avoid driving in fog
* if you hit a pedestrian or cow, go straight to the nearest police station

#### Motorcycles

If you plan on riding a motorbike:

* check that your travel insurance policy covers you
* exercise caution
* always wear a helmet

Restrictions on airspace in some locations (including, but not limited to, Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir) may prevent commercial medical evacuation. Should you be involved in a serious accident, air evacuation by the Indian Air Force may be the only option. Costs can be in the tens of thousands of dollars.

#### Taxis

Use a pre-paid taxi service when you arrive at the airport.

It's difficult to verify if street taxis are legitimate.

Use taxi services booked from hotels or taxi stands. Don't hail taxis on the street.

Don't use unmarked private cars as taxis.

Rideshare apps are widely used in major cities. You can use these apps with a SIM card.

#### Public transport

Bus and train services can be dangerous due to the following:

* overcrowding
* poor maintenance
* drivers who don't have adequate training
* fires

If you travel by train, find out where the emergency exits are located.
