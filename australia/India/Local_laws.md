# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're arrested for a major offence, you could go to prison for several years before you receive a verdict.

If you're imprisoned, there could be delays in getting help from the Australian Government. This is due to India's consular access approval requirements.

#### Look Out Circular (LOC)

If you are charged with an offence or a complaint is made against you, a Look Out Circular (LOC) may be issued against you, preventing you from leaving India until court proceedings are finalised. Court proceedings are lengthy, and delays are common, even for minor cases. You may not be informed if an LOC has been placed against you. Most people only know about an LOC when advised by immigration authorities on arrival or departure.

#### Satellite phones and satellite enabled navigation devices

It is illegal to carry or operate satellite phones or enabled devices in India without a licence. Australian citizens have been detained for carrying satellite phones and satellite-enabled navigational devices into the country without prior permission. This may occur even in the case of transits.

#### Drugs and alcohol

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include mandatory sentences and the death penalty. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months imprisonment for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year prison sentence applies for possession of other amounts. The judicial process is slow, and it is normal for you to be detained for months or years while your case is processed.

The legal drinking age varies, depending on the state. The legal drinking age can vary for different types of alcohol.

Some states permit alcohol use for medicinal purposes only. Others require you to hold a permit to buy, transport or drink alcohol.

Some states prohibit alcohol from being brought in from outside the state, and police may check vehicles to enforce this law.

Check the alcohol laws of each place you plan to visit.

#### E-cigarettes and vaporisers

It is illegal to import, possess or use e-cigarettes, vaporisers or their components, such as refills. Penalties include imprisonment.

#### Surrogacy laws

#### Local customs

Codes of dress and behaviour are strict in India. These are particularly important at religious sites.
