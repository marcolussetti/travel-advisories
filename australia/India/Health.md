#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you travel.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Mental health treatment and services can differ to those in Australia.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in India. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Air quality

[Air pollution](https://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) levels in parts of India can spike to hazardous levels during the winter months, October to February.

Severe pollution can cause:

* flight delays
* traffic delays
* accidents

It can also increase the risk of breathing problems.

People who have pre-existing medical conditions, particularly heart and lung conditions, may be especially affected.

If you're concerned about the levels of air pollution:

* seek medical advice
* follow advice from local authorities about methods to reduce exposure
* monitor an air quality index
* reduce your exposure

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities in major cities have adequate treatment standards. Facilities in remote and rural areas can be very limited or unavailable.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you may be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive with long lead times.

Restrictions on airspace in some locations (including, but not limited to, Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir) may prevent commercial medical evacuation. Should you be involved in a serious accident, air evacuation by the Indian Air Force may be the only option. Costs can be in the tens of thousands of dollars.

#### Medical tourism

Medical tourism has become more common in India, including for:

* cosmetic procedures
* experimental stem cell treatments
* dental treatments

Standards at a discount and uncertified medical establishments can be poor.

Serious and possibly life-threatening complications can and do occur.

If you plan to visit India for medical tourism:

* research and choose your medical service providers carefully
* don't use discounts or uncertified medical service providers
