## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorist activities, violent demonstrations and armed clashes sometimes occur in India. Avoid crowded places and possible targets. Large crowds at religious ceremonies and gatherings can also be dangerous. People have been killed in stampedes. Always have an exit plan.
* Women may face higher levels of verbal and physical harassment or sexual assault. Avoid travelling alone, even in major cities and tourist sites.
* Travellers have been robbed and assaulted after consuming spiked drinks or food. Don't leave your food or drinks unattended or accept food or drinks from strangers. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas.](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol)
* Petty theft is common in crowded areas such as markets and public transport. Thieves on motorbikes snatch bags and jewellery. Carry only what you need. Pay close attention to your belongings.
* Scams are common. These can involve fake tour guides, ATM and credit card skimming, and fraudulent access to government services. If you're a scam victim, report it to the police to get an official report for your travel insurer.
* Severe weather is common. This includes heat waves and dust storms in summer and flooding during the monsoon season. Check with your tour operator for possible disruptions.
* Curfews and restrictions have been imposed in parts of Manipur following violent demonstrations which have resulted in casualties. Security agencies have increased their presence in the region. Mobile data, internet and transport services continue to be affected. Further restrictions may be imposed at short notice. If you are in Manipur, you should consider leaving if it’s safe to do so. Monitor local media for updates, follow the advice of local authorities and take official warnings seriously.

* Insect-borne diseases are common. Malaria is a risk in many parts of India, including major cities. Dengue is widespread, especially during the monsoon season. Zika virus outbreaks may occur. Other insect-borne diseases include Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and filariasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated. If you're pregnant, discuss this with your doctor.
* Cases of Mpox have been reported in India. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* HIV/AIDS is widespread. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are very common. These include cholera, typhoid and hepatitis. Drink only treated or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Air pollution can reach dangerous levels, especially in winter. It can disrupt transport and cause breathing problems. Discuss your travel plans with a doctor if you have an existing health condition. Elderly persons, pregnant mothers and those with newborns should take extra care.
