#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

China has included Australia in its visa waiver program from 1 July 2024 to 31 December 2025.

If you hold an ordinary Australian passport, you may be able to enter China without a visa for no more than 30 days for business, tourism, visiting family and friends or transit. Different rules apply for official and diplomatic passport holders.

Your eligibility to enter China will be assessed by Chinese authorities at the border. We are aware of cases of Australian citizens being denied entry.

Australians intending to travel to China should contact the nearest [Chinese embassy/consulate](http://au.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/) to confirm visa [eligibility](http://au.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/) and other travel requirements.

If you need a full visa, you must get this before you travel.

See the [Embassy of the People's Republic of China](https://www.visaforchina.cn/globle/) for eligibility requirements and visa types.

Foreigners holding valid Chinese residence permits for work, personal matters and reunion may be able to enter China without applying for new visas. Contact your nearest Chinese embassy/consulate to confirm your visa remains valid or to apply for a new visa.

If you're already travelling or living in China, contact the Foreigner's Entry and Exit Administration Section of the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) for visa information.

Authorities will scan your fingerprints when you arrive if you're aged between 14 and 70 years.

Authorities have strict penalties for visa violations. Penalties include:

* fines imposed for each day overstayed, including if you’re in detention
* detention from 5 to 30 days

Make sure you leave China no more than 30 days after arriving or before your visa expires.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of China](http://au.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

You may be subject to medical screening when entering China. Recent changes to health laws mean you may be refused entry into China if you do not comply with on-arrival medical screening requirements. This may include answering medical questions or undergoing a medical examination. China has also implemented on-arrival screening for Mpox symptoms.

#### Travel to Hong Kong and Macau

Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Regions (SAR). They have separate visa and entry rules to mainland China.

If you plan to leave mainland China to visit Hong Kong or Macau, you may need a new Chinese visa to re-enter mainland China. Get the correct visa before you leave Australia.

You may be asked to present your previous passport and Chinese visa if you:

* intend to apply for a visa at the border of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, or Zhuhai and Macau, and
* you held a Chinese visa in a recently replaced passport

If you've visited China before, authorities may deny you a visa-on-arrival if you can't show your previous China visa.

Some visas issued in Hong Kong or at Hong Kong-Macau-Chinese mainland border crossings are valid for limited travel to designated areas only, such as:

* Shenzhen
* Zhuhai
* other areas in Guangdong Province

Using these permits to travel to other parts of China is illegal. Carefully check your visa limitations.

#### Other formalities

#### Newborns

If you’re a parent of a newborn baby born in China, you must register the child with the local Public Security Bureau. You must do this within 30 days of the child's birth and will require the child’s birth certificate for registration.

Apply for a Chinese visa in the child's passport. The child will need a valid visa to leave China.

For the registration process you need:

* the child's birth certificate
* parents' passports
* child's passport

For citizenship issues, see the 'Dual citizenship' section under [Local laws](#local-laws).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries will only let you enter if your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passports

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy, high commission or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If you get a new passport while in China, you must get a new Chinese visa. Otherwise, you won't be able to leave China.

Chinese authorities can take up to 10 working days to issue a visa. It can take longer during Chinese holiday periods.

Authorities won't speed up the process to meet your travel or flight schedule.

To replace your passport and visa:

* get an official report from the local police
* get a replacement passport from the nearest [Australian embassy, high commission or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)
* apply at the Foreigners Entry and Exit Administration Section of the local Public Security Bureau for a replacement Chinese visa in your new passport

You can use the police report when checking in to a hotel.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency in China is the Renminbi (RMB).

Chinese law limits the amount of foreign currency you can carry in and out of China.

If you're carrying more than $US5,000 cash or the same amount in another currency, you must declare it when you arrive in China.

Keep the declaration. You need to show it to customs officials when you leave.

If you plan to leave China carrying more than $US5,000 or the same amount in another currency, you need permission from a Chinese bank.

You can't leave China with more than $US10,000 or the same amount in foreign currency.

ATMs are widely available in major Chinese cities. They accept all major credit cards.

Credit cards are widely accepted in major cities, especially in international hotels and restaurants.

In smaller cities, you may find it harder to use international cards.

#### Local travel

Authorities restrict travel by foreigners in China.

If you plan to travel outside major tourist areas, check that the area is 'open to foreigners'. For example, restrictions apply near military installations and some border areas.

Travel and living conditions vary greatly between cities and less developed rural areas.

In rural areas, you may have trouble accessing these services:

* banking
* internet
* landline phone
* mobile phone

#### Driving permit

All drivers must hold a valid Chinese driver's licence.

Foreign driver's licences and International Driving Permits (IDP) aren't valid in mainland China.

Long-term residents can apply for a Chinese driver's licence at their local Vehicle Management Office.

If you're going to China on a visa with less than 90 days validity, you may be able to get a provisional driver's licence. This will be valid for the length of your visa.

If you're hiring a car in China, check driving licence requirements with your car hire company.

Age and health restrictions apply and vary depending on the class of driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Travel by road is dangerous because of the following:

* poorly maintained roads in rural areas
* speeding and drink driving

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in China than in Australia.

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

To ride a motorcycle, you must hold a valid Chinese motorcycle licence.

Australian motorcycle licences and International Driving Permits (IDP) issued for motorcycles aren't valid in mainland China.

Rules for applying for a motorbike licence, including a provisional motorcycle licence, are similar to those for cars. Contact your local Vehicle Management Office.

You don't need a licence to ride an electric bike.

Check your insurance covers you for riding all types of motorised bikes.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only licensed taxis or limousine services with a good reputation, preferably those arranged through your hotel or one of the main ride-sharing apps.

When hailing a taxi, always insist that the meter is used.

Many taxis in China don't have seatbelts.

Taxi drivers may swap legitimate RMB100 notes for fake notes. They will then return the fake note and refuse to accept it as payment because it’s counterfeit.

Ridesharing apps are widely used in major Chinese cities.

#### Public transport

Tour operators, public buses and ferries might not meet safety standards, especially in rural areas.

Transport operators may not:

* provide adequate safety equipment
* maintain vehicles and equipment
* have safety precautions in place

Always use available safety equipment, such as lifejackets or seatbelts.

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Air travel

Travel restrictions can come into effect at short notice.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [China's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=B) with the Aviation Safety Network.
