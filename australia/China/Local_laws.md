# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

The Australian Government can't intervene in the Chinese justice process.

In China, authorities may treat a person aged 12 years and above as an adult under the law.

If detained, a person of this age will be:

* held with adults
* subject to the same conditions and legal processes as adults

The Australian Government can't help you if you're a [dual national](/before-you-go/who-you-are/dual-nationals "Advice for dual nationals") and you travel on your:

* Chinese passport
* Hong Kong or Macau Mainland Travel Permit
* identity card issued by Taiwan
* any non-Australian foreign passport

#### Death penalty

China has the death penalty for drug offences and other serious crimes. Under Chinese criminal law, it's possible for espionage and other national security offences to attract serious penalties, from lengthy custodial sentences to the death penalty.

If you're sentenced to death, it's unlikely that Chinese authorities will grant you leniency.

#### Drugs

Penalties for all types of drug offences including use, possession, manufacturing, selling or trafficking are severe and include life in prison or the death penalty.

Authorities strictly enforce these laws, even for small quantities of 'soft' drugs, such as marijuana. These laws and severe penalties also apply to minors.

Authorities conduct random drug tests. Police raids on nightclubs and bars frequented by foreigners have increased, with patrons subjected to urine and / or hair tests. A positive drug test can result in fines, detention and deportation, regardless of when or where the drugs were used.

Authorities have executed foreigners for drug offences.

#### Legal proceedings and investigations

Authorities may not allow you to leave China if you're involved in a:

* criminal matter or investigation
* civil or commercial dispute

#### Exit bans

Sometimes people are only aware of an exit ban on them once they try to leave China.

Exit bans can affect you even if you're not directly involved in the legal proceedings. Authorities have stopped some Australians from leaving China because of a dispute involving family members. Sometimes it is years before authorities allow people to leave China.

If you're involved in local legal matters:

* get professional advice
* be aware of your rights and responsibilities

#### Other laws

China has strict laws on national security, which it updates from time to time. These laws can be interpreted broadly and applied expansively and harshly. Chinese authorities may define certain behaviours and activities as endangering national security that would not be considered as such in Australia. This could include activities that occurred outside of China.

Authorities have detained foreigners on allegations of 'endangering national security'. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or harsh enforcement of local laws, including broadly defined National Security Laws. Under Chinese criminal law, it's possible for espionage and other national security offences to attract serious penalties, from lengthy custodial sentences to the death penalty.

In China, it's illegal to:

* use drugs
* test positive for drugs (even if you used drugs before you arrived in China)
* demonstrate without prior approval from the government
* preach, distribute religious literature and associate with unapproved religious groups
* take part in any Falun Gong activities
* gamble or promote gambling activities
* engage in prostitution
* take photos of military or government buildings without official approval.

If you break these laws, you could be:

* arrested
* imprisoned
* fined
* deported

#### Registration and identification

Under Chinese law, you must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau. You must do this within 24 hours of arriving and each time you change your residential location.

Staff do this as part of the standard check-in process if you stay at a hotel.

If you're staying elsewhere, such as with family or friends, visit the nearest police station. Present your passport and a valid Chinese visa.

You must always carry identification and show it to the police if they ask for it.

Authorities will accept your passport or a Chinese residence card as forms of identity.

If you don't register your place of residence or carry identification, authorities can fine or detain you.

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Homosexuality is not illegal in China but be aware of local sensitivities.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Doing business in China

China has experienced higher numbers of commercial disputes involving Australians in recent years.

Before starting business relationships:

* investigate the market
* get professional advice
* conduct appropriate due diligence

Get professional legal advice before entering into any contract in China. This includes residential leases and business contracts.

#### Business versus criminal matters

Many business issues Australians consider civil or commercial are classified as criminal matters in China. This is especially the case if state enterprises or state assets are involved.

Penalties for commercial and economic crimes are often severe.

Cases of Australians and other foreigners being held against their will at their workplace have increased. These incidents involved other companies or employees trying to resolve business and employment disputes. They do this through protests, and often with threats of violence.

#### Employment in China

Disputes over working and living conditions for Australians working in China are common. This is particularly the case for those teaching English.

If you’re considering travel to China for work:

* verify the true nature of the work on offer
* make sure you have the correct visa before you arrive

Authorities can fine or detain you if you don't maintain a valid visa.

Get professional legal advice before signing any contract in Australia or China.

Carefully check local laws about business or other activities you wish to undertake in China.

Employment contracts may contain conditions that disadvantage you. For example, if your contract is terminated early, conditions may state that:

* you give up your right to a return air ticket
* your employer may withhold your pay

Don't surrender your passport to your employer for 'safe-keeping.' Businesses with a good reputation won't ask you to do this.

#### Dual citizenship

The Chinese Government doesn't recognise dual nationality. It won't let us provide consular help to Chinese-Australian dual nationals who travel on their:

* Chinese passport
* Hong Kong or Macau Mainland Travel Permit
* identity card issued by Taiwan
* any non-Australian foreign passport

If you're a Chinese-Australian dual national:

* travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services")
* get a visa to China
* always present yourself as an Australian citizen

If you're a former Chinese citizen, Chinese authorities may:

* treat you as a Chinese citizen
* refuse you access to Australian consular services

This can happen even if you entered China on an Australian or other foreign passport and you:

* haven't renounced your citizenship according to Chinese law
* haven't formally advised the Chinese authorities of your Australian citizenship
* continue to maintain a Chinese passport or household registration

Authorities may not allow certain categories of Chinese citizens, such as state officials, to renounce their Chinese nationality under Chinese law.

Get professional legal advice if you're unsure of your citizenship status under Chinese law.

If your child is born in China and you plan to get Australian citizenship by descent, contact the [Australian Department of Home Affairs](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/) for advice.

If one parent is from mainland China, authorities will consider a child born in China to be a Chinese national.

Local authorities may not recognise the child's Australian citizenship and passport.

Contact the local Entry and Exit Administration Bureau for details.
