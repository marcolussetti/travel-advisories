# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime occurs, including:

* pickpocketing
* bag-snatching
* theft of laptops, passports and mobile phones

If you resist, you can be injured if criminals turn violent.

Criminals target travellers in crowded areas, including on transport.

People have reported [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), particularly in areas popular with expats. This includes bar and shopping precincts in major cities.

Travellers also report being drugged and robbed in China after accepting offers of food, drink or transportation from strangers.

#### Scams

There are [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") that target travellers.

Scammers invite travellers for a massage, teahouse service, or nearby cafes and bars. They offer various reasons and may say they wish 'to practise their English'.

Afterwards, they present travellers with an inflated bill. They won't let the traveller leave until they pay the bill by credit card.

#### Drug scams

Sometimes travellers are asked to carry concealed drugs out of China.

Never carry parcels or luggage for others.

Always pack your own bags.

#### ATM scams

ATM scams occur. Sometimes scammers set up fake ATMs that take the user's card.

Only use ATMs inside a secure place such as a bank or shopping centre. Do this during daylight hours.

If you're the victim of a crime or scam, report it to the nearest police station immediately.

Always obtain a police report when reporting a crime.

#### Fake money scams

Be careful of scams if paying a taxi fare with a RMB100 note. The taxi driver may swap the note for a fake note. They will then return the fake note and refuse to accept it as payment because it’s counterfeit.

#### Bandits

Armed bandit attacks are a risk in remote areas bordering:

* Pakistan
* Myanmar
* Laos
* Vietnam
* Russia

Be careful if travelling in these areas.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

The Chinese Government prohibits demonstrations they haven't approved. Authorities may arrest protesters.

Avoid protests, demonstrations and large gatherings.

Don't photograph, film or participate in protests or other acts that authorities may consider provocative.

#### Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang)

Increased security measures are in place in Xinjiang.

People of Uyghur descent are particularly affected.

Security checks in major cities in Xinjiang are common. Be ready to show photo ID if asked.

Violent incidents causing deaths and injuries have occurred across Xinjiang.

The government may restrict movement and communications in Xinjiang with little warning.

#### Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet)

In the past, protests have turned violent, and people have been killed or injured.

If you're travelling to Tibet, get permission from Chinese authorities first.

You must also apply for a Tibet Entry Permit from the Tibet Tourism Bureau.

You can only lodge applications for Tibet Entry Permits through specialised travel agents in China.

You can only travel as part of an organised tour.

See [Travel](#travel).

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Attacks could be targeted or random. They may include places travellers and expats visit.

In recent years, terrorist and other violent attacks have caused injuries and deaths in public places. Targets include railway stations and markets.

You could become the victim of violence directed at others.

#### Climate and natural disasters

China experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* [typhoons](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [earthquakes](/node/345)
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")

#### Typhoons

Typhoons can happen along the southern and eastern coasts between May and November.

The direction and strength of typhoons can change with little warning.

If there's a typhoon:

* you may get stuck in the area
* flights and other transport could be delayed or suspended
* access to seaports may be affected
* adequate shelter may not be available
* available transport may fill quickly

If a typhoon is approaching:

* know the evacuation plan for your accommodation or cruise ship
* identify your local shelter
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* closely monitor alerts and advice from authorities such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/)
* keep in contact with your friends and family

If you plan to travel, contact your airline for the latest flight information.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

China can experience earthquakes and large, destructive tsunamis.

If there's an earthquake or tsunami:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media for updates

Check with the [Tsunami Warning Centre](https://www.tsunami.gov/) for updates on seismic activity and tsunamis.

If you're near the coast, move to high ground straight away if advised, or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.
