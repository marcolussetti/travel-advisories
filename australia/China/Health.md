#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you travel.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in China. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Water

Depending on your location, tap water in China may be unsafe to drink.

Drink only bottled water with sealed lids.

#### Bird flu (avian influenza)

People have died from [avian influenza](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/avian-influenza-bird-flu) in China. Avian influenza virus strains continue to circulate in poultry in China.

The primary source of infection seems to be poultry handled in poultry markets.

To protect yourself from avian influenza:

* stay away from live poultry
* don't visit live bird and animal markets, including 'wet' markets and poultry farms
* practise good personal hygiene

When preparing food, handle poultry properly. Thoroughly cook all parts of the poultry.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is a significant risk in China.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.

If you need medical treatment, you could be exposed to unsafe blood and blood products. This is a particular risk in regional China.

Ask for sterilised equipment. You may need to pay for new syringes in hospitals or clinics.

#### Insect-borne illnesses

[Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis) is widespread in rural southern China from June to August. The disease is also known as encephalitis B. A vaccine is available.

The risk of [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) increases during warm weather and is more significant in rural areas, particularly in the provinces of:

* Hainan
* Yunnan
* Fujian
* Guangdong
* Guangxi
* Guizhou
* Sichuan
* Tibet (Zanbo Valley areas only)
* Anhui
* Hubei
* Hunan
* Jiangsu
* Jiangxi
* Shandong

[Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) cases have risen sharply, especially in Guangdong and Guangzhou. Risks increase during the wet season.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria
* get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis

#### Rabies

Animal and human [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) are common. Health authorities report many cases each year.

Be careful with both wild and domestic animals in China.

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help immediately.

#### Hand, foot and mouth disease

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/archives/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) is common. Sometimes serious outbreaks happen.

Outbreaks usually start in March or April and peak in May. However, outbreaks can continue until October each year.

The disease mainly affects children under the age of 10 years. Adult cases, particularly in young adults, are not unusual.

People with HFMD experience fever, blisters and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.

The disease is spread by direct contact with nose and throat discharges and faeces of infected people.

To protect yourself from illness:

* wash your hands carefully and regularly
* take other hygiene precautions

#### Pollution

High pollution levels are a problem.

Children, the elderly and those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions may be especially affected by pollution.

Authorities issue red alerts when pollution is expected to be especially bad.

When a red alert is in place, authorities:

* close schools
* limit car use
* suspend construction activity

Flights are regularly delayed in China because of smog.

Dust storms occur across the north of China. They can:

* cause eye, nose, mouth and throat irritations
* make heart and lung problems worse

Get medical advice if you're worried about air pollution.

Follow the advice from local authorities about days with bad pollution and how to reduce your exposure.

#### Altitude sickness

Parts of China are at altitudes of over 3,000m, including:

* Tibet
* Qinghai
* parts of Xinjiang
* Western Sichuan

If you travel to those areas, you may get [altitude sickness](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/altitude-sickness).

People with lung, heart or chest problems should take extra care. Even if you're healthy, you can still be affected.

Symptoms of altitude sickness include:

* headache
* dizziness
* vomiting
* coordination problems

In severe cases, fluid can build up in your lungs, brain or both, which can be fatal.

To protect yourself from altitude sickness:

* ascend slowly, especially above an altitude of 2500m
* rest when needed and don't push your body
* avoid alcohol and cigarettes

If you're affected by severe altitude sickness, get to lower ground as soon as possible.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

International standard medical services in China are expensive.

If you plan on staying in China for a while:

* find out about local health insurance
* ask your employer if they provide health cover

Some hospitals in major cities have special departments for treating foreigners.

However, the standard of medical care and the range of medications is often limited, especially outside major cities.

Medical staff in rural areas may not be adequately trained.

Hospitals and doctors may ask for an up-front cash payment before treating you. This includes emergency care.

Medical evacuation from China can be very expensive.

#### Medical tourism

Travel to China for [medical treatment](/before-you-go/health/medical-tourism "Going overseas for a medical procedure (medical tourism)") is increasing.

Research and choose your medical service providers carefully. Ask health professionals and former patients about the quality.

Avoid uncertified medical service providers. Their standards may be poor, and they may be unable to provide the advertised medical care.
