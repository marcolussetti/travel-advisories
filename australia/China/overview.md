## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime occurs. Criminals target travellers in crowded areas, including on public transport. Resisting can lead to violence.
* Scams targeting travellers can lead to loss of money, violence and serious assault. Report scams to the nearest police station.
* Armed attacks are a risk in remote border regions. Be careful if travelling in these areas.
* The Chinese Government strictly controls demonstrations. Authorities may arrest protesters. Avoid protests and large gatherings. Don't photograph or video protests.
* Increased security measures are in place in Xinjiang. Be ready to show photo ID if asked.
* There's civil unrest and political tension in Tibet. Get permission from Chinese authorities before you go. You can only travel to Tibet as part of an organised tour.

### Health

* Tap water in China may not be safe to drink. Drink only bottled water with intact seals.
* People have died from bird flu in China. Stay away from live poultry. When preparing food, handle poultry properly and ensure it's thoroughly cooked.
* HIV/AIDS is a significant risk in China. Take precautions if engaging in activities that expose you to the risk of infection. Ask for sterilised equipment when receiving medical treatment.
* Animal and human rabies and hand, foot and mouth disease are common. Be careful with both wild and domestic animals in China. Wash your hands carefully and regularly. Take other hygiene precautions.
* High pollution levels are a problem in major cities. Follow the advice from local authorities on days with harmful pollution.

### Local laws

* The Australian Government can't intervene in the Chinese justice process. We also can't help if you're a dual national and don't enter China on your Australian passport.
* Chinese law may treat a person aged 12 years and older as an adult. China has strict laws and severe criminal punishments including the death penalty and life imprisonment.
* You must always carry identification and show it to the police if they ask.
* Chinese authorities undertake random drug testing on foreign nationals and can prosecute individuals who return a positive test result regardless of when or where the drugs were taken.
* Many business and employment issues may be considered criminal matters in China. Penalties are severe. Get professional legal advice before entering into any employment or commercial contract in China.
* If you're a former Chinese citizen, authorities may treat you as a citizen and refuse access to Australian consular services. Get legal advice if you're unsure of your citizenship status under Chinese law.

### Travel

* China has included Australia in its visa waiver program. If you hold an ordinary Australian passport, you may be able to enter China without a visa for no more than 30 days for business, tourism, visiting family and friends or transit. Your eligibility to enter China will be assessed by Chinese authorities at the border. We are aware of cases of Australian citizens being denied entry.
* Holders of official and diplomatic passports will still need to apply for a visa before travelling to China.
* You may be permitted to enter China if you're a foreign national holding a valid residence permit for work, personal matters or reunion.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of China](http://au.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/) for the latest details.
* When entering China, you may be subject to medical screening, including on-arrival checks for Mpox. If you decline medical screening, you may be refused entry.
* You must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau. This will be part of the standard check-in process if you stay at a hotel.
