#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your airline or your nearest [embassy or consulate of Mauritius](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/128)for details about the latest visa and entry requirements.

#### Visas

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. If you don't, the Australian Government can’t help you.

If you're staying less than 60 days, a visa will be provided to you free of charge on arrival. For other types of visits, you'll need to apply for a visa before your travel at your nearest [Mauritius embassy, High Commission or consulate](https://foreign.govmu.org/Pages/Embassies%20and%20Consulates/Mauritius%20Diplomatic%20Missions%20Overseas/Mauritius-Diplomatic-Missions-Overseas-Main-Page.aspx). 

If you need to extend your Tourist/Business visas or resident permits contact the [Mauritian Passport and Immigration Office](https://passport.govmu.org/passport/?page_id=399) or by email on [piovisa@govmu.org](mailto:piovisa@govmu.org).

#### Other formalities

You should complete the [Mauritius All-in-One Travel Digital Form](https://safemauritius.govmu.org/) either online before you travel or when you arrive at the airport. 

If you're arriving from a country known to have malaria, you'll receive a follow-up call or visit from the Mauritian Health Department. You may be asked to do a blood test.

#### Passport

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Mauritius Rupee (MUR).

If you're travelling with more than MUR 500,000, you'll need to declare it when you arrive and depart. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Don't change money on the street. Use banks and official exchange bureaus.

There are ATMs in most towns and in large shopping centres.

You can use credit cards at most hotels, restaurants and large shops.

Check with your bank if your cards will work in Mauritius.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

The risk of being injured or killed in a motor vehicle accident in Mauritius is higher than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained and unlit narrow roads
* pedestrians and stray dogs on roads
* motorcyclists
* deep ditches beside roads
* lack of guardrails

Mauritius has a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol consumption and driving. If you test positive for alcohol, you risk penalties like heavy fines, imprisonment or licence suspension.

If you plan to drive:

* check you have the right insurance cover
* get to know local traffic laws and practices

In case of an accident, when no injury has occurred, motorists may exchange information and report details to the authorities. You should remain at the scene and request the assistance of local law enforcement.

#### Driver's license

To drive in Mauritius, you need to be at least 18 years old and have either:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted); or
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Obtain your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Motorcycles

Make sure your insurance policy covers you before riding a motorbike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and limousines. In Mauritius, all registered taxis are clearly marked with a yellow sign and the name of the operating base on the door. Try to book them through your hotel or accommodation.

Taxis are not metered. Negotiate the fare for your journey before engaging their services. 

Book in advance if you're travelling at night.

#### Public transport

Public transport is operational. While not compulsory, face masks are recommended on public transport.

Buses are the primary mode of public transport in Mauritius. Public buses that run between the main towns are generally reliable however some buses may not meet the same roadworthy standards as in Australia.  The metro express is a modern, reliable network but only runs between Port Louis and Curepipe.

#### Sea travel

There have been no pirate attacks in Mauritius' territorial waters. However, [piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy) is a major threat in the Indian Ocean.

Don't travel within 1000 nautical miles (1852km) off the Somali coast. Sailing vessels are a target for pirates. Read [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/imb/) from the International Maritime Bureau.
