## Overview

### Safety

* Cyclone season is from November to May, but cyclones can also occur at other times. Cyclones can result in heavy rainfall, strong winds and flash flooding. There may be disruptions to power and water supplies. Monitor official sources and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Civil unrest is rare, but demonstrations can happen. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Crime levels are low, but petty crime occurs, including pickpocketing and bag-snatching. Don't walk alone after dark. Use ATMs in banks, hotels and shops, not on the street.
* Some travellers have been robbed and assaulted in unregistered beachside bungalows. Stay in accommodation that's registered by local authorities.
* There have been reports of taxi scams at the airport. Only use registered taxis marked with a yellow sign and the name of the operating base on the door.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases including dengue and chikungunya are present. There have been cases of malaria in the past. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases, including gastroenteritis and hepatitis, are present. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* The standard of public medical facilities varies. Private doctors or clinics can be expensive. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Know and follow local laws. You can’t smoke or vape in any indoor public area and some outdoor places. It's illegal to own cigarette papers or rolling machines.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences include prison sentences and heavy fines.
* If you break the law, you may need to stay in Mauritius to wait for your court hearing. Legal cases take a long time to process.
* Mauritius has conservative dress and behaviour standards. Take care not to offend, especially when visiting rural areas, religious sites, or religious events. Avoid public displays of affection.

### Travel

* If you're staying for less than 60 days, you can get a 'free of charge visa' on arrival. You must apply for any other visa types before you arrive. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact your nearest Mauritian High Commission or Consulate for the latest details.
* You’ll need to fill out the [Mauritius All-in-One Travel Digital Form](https://safemauritius.govmu.org/). You can do this online, or on arrival at the airport.
* During cyclones the airport may close, and flights may be cancelled or delayed. Make sure your travel insurance covers this. Ensure your airline has your current contact details so you can be reached in case of flight disruptions. Confirm your flight details with your airline or travel provider before going to the airport.
