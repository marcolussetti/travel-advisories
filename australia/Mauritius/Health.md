#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mauritius. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne illnesses occur in Mauritius, particularly in the warmer months from October to May. 

There have been cases of [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection), [chikungunya](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/chikungunya-virus-infection) and [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)in the past.

To protect yourself from these diseases:

* use insect repellent on all exposed skin, including feet
* wear light-coloured clothing that covers your legs and arms
* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof

Get medical advice if you develop a fever, muscle or joint pain, vomiting, a bad headache or a rash.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk. Take precautions if participating in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are a risk, including:

* [gastroenteritis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/gastroenteritis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [leptospirosis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/leptospirosis)
* [Influenza](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal))

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities varies in Mauritius.

Most major public hospitals are modern and well equipped. All doctors speak English and specialised care is available for most injuries and illnesses. Waiting times can be long in public hospitals and services may be limited in small rural hospitals. You may be charged some fees to cover costs.

Most travellers go to private doctors or clinics. Services can be expensive, and upfront payment is generally required. If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to Reunion Island or South Africa. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

There is no healthcare agreement between Australia and Mauritius.

Make sure your travel insurance covers hospital and medical evacuation.

#### Diving accidents

There's only one decompression chamber at Victoria Hospital in Quatre Bornes.
