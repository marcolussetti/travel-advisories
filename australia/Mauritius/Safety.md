# Safety

#### Crime

Crime levels in Mauritius are low. However, petty crime occurs and includes:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* opportunistic theft

This is most likely to occur in crowded outdoor shopping areas, tourist areas, such as beaches, and near ATMs. Women walking alone are at greater risk of verbal harassment and criminal targeting.

Violent crime is not common, but some incidents of [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault), [rape](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault) and murder have occurred, including in resorts. There have also been cases of assault and robbery at unregistered beachside bungalows. 

The crime rate is higher in downtown Port Louis and in the coastal tourist centres of Grand Bay, Pereybere and Flic en Flac.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be aware of your surroundings and alert to suspicious behaviour
* avoid secluded or poorly lit areas, especially after dark
* avoid using ATMs on the street. Use ATMS in banks, shops, hotels or shopping centres
* always lock your vehicle and accommodation and keep your valuables out of sight
* stay in accommodation that's registered with local authorities
* be alert to petty scams and overcharging by vendors on streets, at beaches and in markets.

#### Taxi scams

There have been reports of taxi scams at the airport, where tourists have been robbed after entering unregistered vehicles.

To protect yourself from taxi [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams):

* only use registered taxis. In Mauritius, these are clearly marked with a yellow sign and the name of the operating base on the door
* check the credentials of the driver and agree on the fare, before entering the vehicle
* where possible, book taxis through your hotel or accommodation.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Floods

Mauritius can experience high levels of rainfall. This can cause severe floods. Some areas are also prone to landslides.   
  
In case of heavy rain or flooding, do not enter waterways. Avoid underground parking areas. If you're caught in heavy rain, you should shelter in place until the water subsides. Monitor local media and stay up to date with weather conditions. Follow advice of local authorities.

#### Tsunamis

Mauritius can experience tsunamis.

Be alert to warnings. A tsunami can arrive within minutes of a nearby tremor or earthquake.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive tsunami alerts.

To protect yourself from tsunamis, move immediately to high ground if you:

* are advised by local authorities
* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings.

Once you're on high ground, you should monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities like diving and swimming with dolphins.

Travellers have died or have been seriously injured in accidents during water-based activities and land-based activities such as ziplining.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/activities/adventure):

* check if it's covered in your travel insurance policy
* only use registered operators that have been issued a valid permit by the Ministry of Tourism
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Swimming safety

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* regularly check weather reports
* take warnings seriously
* check media and local sources for information about potential dangers
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment and weather conditions before continuing with planned activities
* if possible, take a friend or family member with you when you undertake swimming or water activities
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers you for planned activities.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical help if you think you or a companion have had your drinks spiked.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate
