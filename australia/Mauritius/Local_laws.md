# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Check local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

In Mauritius, legal cases take a long time to process.   
  
If you're under police investigation, you'll be provisionally charged and not allowed to leave the country without consent from a judge. It can take up to 2 years for the authorities to decide whether to issue a formal charge. You're not allowed to renew your occupation permit or resident permit if you’re provisionally charged with a crime. If you cannot support yourself financially, you’ll be kept in prison while the police finish their investigation.

#### Drugs

Mauritius has severe penalties for drug offences, including fines and jail terms of up to 60 years.

Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry anything through customs for anyone else. If you're found with any drugs, it’s unlikely you’ll be bailed, regardless of the type of drug. Prosecutions take a year or more to come to court, and you’ll be detained until your trial.

#### Other laws

In Mauritius, it's illegal to:

* buy counterfeit or pirated goods
* own cigarette papers or rolling machines
* import, distribute or sell e-cigarettes
* smoke or vape in all indoor public places and some outdoor places.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws overseas, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Mauritius recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, we will only be able to assist you in exceptional circumstances.

Always travel on your Australian passport.

#### Local customs

Mauritian society is conservative. Nudism is not permitted. 

Take care not to offend, especially if you visit:

* rural areas
* a shrine, temple, mosque or other religious site
* a religious event

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

Whilst same-sex sexual activity was decriminalised in October 2023, LGBTQIA+ people still face discrimination. Consider avoiding public displays of affection.
