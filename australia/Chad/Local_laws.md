# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for using, possessing or trafficking drugs are severe. Offenders can expect long jail sentences.

#### Other laws

Local laws reflect the fact that Chad is mainly a Muslim country. Use your common sense and be discreet in how you dress and behave.

Police checks are common. It's illegal to fail to produce identity documents when requested. Foreigners have been arrested for failing to produce identity documents upon request.

Burqas and other face coverings are banned. This is a measure to combat terrorism.

You need a government permit to take any type of photo. Even if you have a permit, you can't take photos of:

* military zones, assets and personnel
* police assets and personnel
* airports
* government buildings

In Chad, it's illegal to:

* participate in same-sex activities
* buy or sell precious gems without a licence
* export precious gems without permission

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Chad recognises dual nationality. If you are a dual national, this limits the consular services we can give if you are arrested or detained.

The Chadian Constitution states that military service is mandatory for both men and women.

Always travel on your Australian passport.

#### Local customs

Respect local religions and social traditions to avoid offending locals.

Same-sex relationships aren't legal in Chad, and Chadian law punishes same-sex relations with imprisonment and a fine.

Avoid public displays of affection regardless of your sexual orientation.

#### Religious festivals

The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is observed in Chad. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
