#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need to obtain a visa to visit Chad before arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an embassy or consulate of Chad for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Commercial flights are currently operating at N'Djamena airport. Check with your airline for further updates.

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Chad. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Land borders

We recommend you do not travel to neighbouring countries, the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya, Sudan and Niger.

Since 2023, the border with Sudan has been closed to travellers. The Adre crossing was temporarily opened in 2024 for aid agencies only. The borders with Libya and the Central African Republic (CAR) remain closed. Other borders may close without warning.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Chad is the Central African CFA Franc (XAF). Euros and US dollars are also accepted.

Declare all local and foreign currency more than XAF10,000 on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

ATMs are limited.

Credit cards and other electronic ways to access cash are usually not accepted.

Credit cards are only accepted by:

* a few hotels in N'Djamena
* Air France

Bring enough cash to meet your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Extensive minefields are present along the borders with:

* Libya
* Sudan
* Central African Republic

If you travel to these areas despite our advice, don't stray off marked tracks.

#### Telecommunications

Telecommunications outside of N'Djamena are unreliable.

Satellite phones are illegal in Chad.

#### Road travel

Road travel in Chad is dangerous due to:

* carjacking and robbery from cars
* armed groups
* bandits
* driving hazards

Hazards include:

* poor street lighting
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* high speeds
* dust storms
* crowding on roads, including pedestrians, animals and non-motorised vehicles

Traffic incidents can provoke an aggressive or violent response from locals.

Carjackings on roads outside N’Djamena are increasing, even in daylight hours.

There have been reports of armed robberies, particularly from cars, in some residential areas of N’Djamena. Foreigners are sometimes targeted.

Avoid travelling by foot at all times in N’Djamena. People have reported [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), even in daylight hours.

Flooding can occur, making some roads impassable, especially during the rainy season from June to September.

If you're travelling outside N'Djamena, you:

* need authorisation from the Ministry of Interior
* must travel by 4WD only

The quality of fuel purchased in rural areas may be poor.

Despite our advice, if you intend to drive in Chad:

* check local security and road conditions
* seek local advice on possible routes
* make sure you have enough travel insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* make contingency plans
* adopt appropriate personal and vehicle security measures

#### Taxis and public transport

Taxis can be unreliable and in poor condition.

Public transport isn't secure and can be unreliable.

If you want to travel by road without driving:

* avoid local taxis
* avoid public transport
* hire a car and driver from a reputable company

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
