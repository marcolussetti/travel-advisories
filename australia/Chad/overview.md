## Overview

### Safety

* Chad is extremely dangerous due to the risk of terrorism, kidnapping, civil unrest and violent crime. If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad, seek professional security advice.
* Violent conflict, including with armed rebels, continues to occur in parts of Chad.
* Terrorist attacks are also a major risk in Chad, especially by the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram. Be alert to possible threats. Use effective personal security measures.

* Legislative, provincial, and municipal elections were held on 29 December 2024. There's an increased risk of disturbances before, during and after elections, including political rallies and demonstrations. There may be an increased police presence throughout the country. Avoid crowds, demonstrations, rallies and protests, as they can turn violent. Clashes between security forces and protestors have previously resulted in deaths. Follow the advice of local authorities.
