#### Travel insurance

You'll need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Chad.

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars upfront for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities in Chad varies.

In N'Djamena, there's a private hospital of international standard. Cash payment in advance of treatment is generally requested.

Outside of N'Djamena:

* medical facilities are very limited
* medications are in short supply
* hygiene standards are poor

You may need to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you.

If you need a medical evacuation to N'Djamena, travel by air if possible.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a location with better facilities. Medical evacuations are very expensive. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical evacuations.
