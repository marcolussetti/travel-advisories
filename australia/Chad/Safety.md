# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terror attacks are a significant risk in Chad. They could happen anywhere and at any time. In the past, attacks have occurred in the capital of N'Djamena.

Attacks could target foreigners or foreign interests, such as:

* hotels, restaurants and bars
* places of worship
* markets and other shopping areas

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* when planning your travel, consider the security arrangements in areas known to be terrorist targets
* if there's a terror attack, leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so
* avoid the affected area in the aftermath of an attack because of the risk of secondary attacks

#### Terrorism hotspots

The Lake Chad region is an ongoing conflict and crisis environment.

Armed groups are active in many parts of Chad. Regional terrorist groups could also launch attacks.

Fighting between government forces and armed groups can also occur anywhere without warning.

Chad's border with Sudan is currently closed to travellers until further notice. The Adre border crossing is temporarily open only for aid agencies.

The border between Chad and Central African Republic remains closed. There's instability in the neighbouring Central African Republic. In May 2021, there were reports of armed groups entering southwestern Chad from the Central African Republic before being repelled by Chadian forces. Civil unrest in southern Chad has also resulted in deaths.

The border between Chad and Libya has been closed. The area bordering Libya is heavily land-mined. The northern regions of Borkou, Ennedi and Tibesti remain unsafe.

Armed groups are active along the borders with:

* Libya
* Sudan
* Niger
* Nigeria (around the Lake Chad Basin)
* the Central African Republic

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") is a risk in remote areas of Africa's Sahel region, which includes Chad. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped. Kidnappers may target foreigners, including humanitarian workers. 

There has been an increase in kidnappings near the Chad-Cameroon-Central African Republic tri-country border.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad:

* get professional security advice
* vary your daily routines
* avoid places popular with foreigners
* avoid unnecessary travel in remote areas
* arrange personal security measures

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Legislative, provincial, and municipal elections were held on 29 December 2024. There's an increased risk of disturbances before, during and after elections, including political rallies and demonstrations. There may be an increased police presence throughout the country. 

Avoid large crowds, political rallies, demonstrations and protests as they can turn violent. Violent clashes have previously occurred between protesters and security forces. Follow the advice of local authorities. 

If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad, you should remain vigilant. The security situation in Chad remains volatile, with an ongoing risk of violent conflict and civil unrest in all parts of the country. Movement restrictions could be implemented at short notice. If the security situation deteriorates rapidly, activate your security arrangements and consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so.

The Lake Chad region remains volatile. The north has seen violent conflict. The southwest has also been affected by armed groups. The east of the country remains prone to violence. Violent clashes between security forces and protestors occurred in N'Djamena and southern Chad in 2021 and 2022, resulting in fatalities.

There are many displaced people throughout Chad.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad:

* take precautions to ensure your safety
* avoid all conflict zones, large gatherings, protests and demonstrations
* monitor the media for unrest or conflict
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Serious crime is increasing across Chad, including in N'Djamena. Incidents include:

* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* kidnapping
* carjacking
* murder

Criminals may specifically target foreigners.

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing and other petty crimes occur in market and commercial areas.

The risk of crime is higher at night but is also common during the daytime.

Local security forces, or people posing as them, may try to extort money from travellers through:

* fake fines
* intimidation

If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad, to protect yourself from petty crime you should:

* avoid carrying large amounts of cash
* always keep car windows and doors locked, even when moving
* secure your hotel room against intruders, even when you're in it
* avoid walking on the street in N'Djamena, even for short distances
* avoid travelling around N'Djamena at night

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can affect your overseas travel.

The rainy season occurs from May to October in southern Chad and from June to September in central Chad. Floods are a risk during the rainy season. In 2024, widespread floods impacted the entire country, including the capital city N'Djamena.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family

If, despite our advice, you travel to Chad and you're visiting an area recently affected by severe weather or natural disaster:

* confirm your plans with your employer, tour operator or airline
* check conditions with your employer, local tour operators and hotels
