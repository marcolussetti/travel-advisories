#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Peru. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

#### Altitude sickness

You're at risk of [altitude sickness](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/altitude-sickness) if you travel above 2500m. The risk is greater if your ascent is rapid.

Altitude sickness can be life-threatening and can affect anyone, even if you're healthy.

You're more at risk of altitude sickness if you:

* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before you get used to the altitude
* have health problems that affect breathing

Many areas of Peru are above 2500m, including:

* Cusco
* Colca Canyon
* Puno and Lake Titicaca

See your doctor for specific advice.

Check if your insurance covers emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) is widespread in Peru. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

Peru is currently experiencing a [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) outbreak. Monitor local media for up-to-date advice on risk levels in particular areas.

[Zika](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) and [oropouche](https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html) are a risk. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is also a risk in Peru.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Consult your doctor about how to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Severe outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are adequate in major cities but limited elsewhere.

Doctors and hospitals often require payment before they will treat you, including for emergency care.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
