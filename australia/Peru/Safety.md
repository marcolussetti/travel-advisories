# Safety

#### Crime

Violent crime is common in Peru, including in the cities of:

* Lima
* Cusco
* Arequipa

Violent crimes include:

* [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment")
* [armed robbery and muggings](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* carjackings

You could encounter:

* armed robbery and [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") on Amazon River boats
* theft as you sleep on intercity bus routes between Lima, Ica, Nazca and Cusco
* assault and robbery at gunpoint on intercity buses
* bogus roadblocks or checkpoints on roads outside major cities after dark

If you're sexually assaulted and decide to report it to the police, do it as soon as you can. You can expect to be examined to obtain forensic evidence as part of the investigation. If you delay reporting, you may experience more scrutiny by local authorities and some evidence may be lost.

States of emergency may be implemented in response to crime, allowing the armed forces to support the police in maintaining law and order. Some civil rights could be suspended. For information on states of emergency, visit the legal gazette [El Peruano official newspaper](https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas) (in Spanish).

#### Taxis

Travellers using unlicensed taxis have been victims of robbery, assault and rape.

Use a phone dispatch service or taxi service app to book a licensed taxi. Ask for help from staff at hotels, hostels, restaurants or entertainment venues. Be careful and pay attention to suspicious behaviour, even when taking transport booked via apps. If possible, avoid taking taxis or ride-shares by yourself. 

#### Intercity buses

Robberies and assaults occur frequently on intercity buses, including while passengers are sleeping. Avoid placing personal belongings on overhead racks, under your seats or out of your sight. Ensure that your belongings, including your passport, other travel documents and valuable items, are secure at all times. Use only reputable bus companies.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, is common. Thieves are often well dressed.

Criminals target people walking alone after dark, especially leaving bars or nightclubs.

Thieves frequently target mobile phones. Be aware of your surroundings before using your mobile phone in public spaces and be discreet while using it. Avoid using your phone curb-side on the street, as you may be targeted by snatch-and-grab thieves on motorcycles.

Hotspots for thieves include:

* public areas
* hotels
* conference centres
* restaurants

Smash-and-grab attacks are common in various locations around Lima and other cities. Thieves snatch items from cars stopped at traffic lights.

If you plan to go on a cruise, check the company has adequate security before booking.

#### Personal security

Travellers in Peru can be victims of:

* food or drink spiking, followed by robbery or assault
* '[express kidnappings](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")', where kidnappers force victims to withdraw money from ATMs before releasing them

To protect yourself from crime:

* don't accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers or people you have just met
* don't leave food or drink unattended
* exchange money in banks, exchange bureaus or in your hotel
* use ATMs in banks, shopping centres or hotels where possible

#### Ayahuasca tourism

Ayahuasca tourism is a growing industry in the jungle regions. Shamans perform psychedelic rituals of spiritual cleansing.

Ayahuasca is not illegal, but some participants have been assaulted, including sexual assault, and robbed.

Ceremonies often take place in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health resources and limited communication with local authorities.

Most facilities lack basic first aid or emergency plans for people who suffer physical or mental effects after ceremonies. Participants report symptoms from being more alert but out of control through to amnesia. Several tourists have died after consuming the hallucinogenic substances in these ceremonies.

If you decide to take part in ayahuasca tourism:

* research potential ayahuasca tour operators before signing up
* avoid participating in ayahuasca rituals without a trusted friend present

The Peruvian Ministry of Health has produced [a guide (in Spanish)](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minsa/noticias/1006329-minsa-ins-brinda-guia-para-el-uso-seguro-e-informado-de-la-ayahuasca) on the safe and informed use of ayahuasca.

#### Border areas and VRAEM

Drug traffickers operate in:

* the border area between Peru and Colombia
* the valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM region)

Take additional precautions in these areas.

Reconsider your need to travel to the Valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM). Cocaine production and trafficking occurs in the VRAEM. Travel is particularly dangerous in areas where there is coca cultivation and processing.

Reconsider your need to travel within 20km of the border with Colombia, and areas bordering Ecuador in the regions of Loreto, Amazonas and Cajamarca. Armed guerrilla forces from Colombia sometimes enter Peru’s remote areas.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping occurs in Peru and is primarily perpetrated by criminal groups. Tourists travelling alone are particularly at risk, including of ‘express kidnapping’, where victims are abducted for a short period and forced to withdraw money from ATMs for their release. A large proportion of the incidents take place in Lima. Criminal gangs have also targeted mining operations for kidnappings in La Libertad in north-western Peru in 2025. 

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings – avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk . It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don’t set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone . There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone . Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Demonstrations and protests occur frequently in Peru. These can cause some disruption to travel services throughout the country and sometimes turn violent. These include airport and land border closures, railways, roads and river blockades. In Lima, the historic centre is often the site of demonstrations.

States of emergency may be implemented in response to civil unrest, allowing the armed forces to support the police in maintaining law and order. Some civil rights could be suspended. For information on states of emergency, visit the legal gazette [El Peruano official newspaper](https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas) (in Spanish).

If you plan to travel by road, research your planned route carefully, including regularly checking the [official list of road closures](http://gis.sutran.gob.pe/alerta_sutran/) (in Spanish), and take precautions to ensure your safety.

National or regional strikes can be called at short notice, further disrupting domestic air travel, public transport and road networks.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor the media for updates
* avoid areas affected by demonstrations and protests
* follow the advice of local authorities
* contact your airline or tour operator to confirm arrangements before you travel

If you're near a demonstration, leave if it's safe to do so. It's illegal for foreigners in Peru to participate in political activities, including demonstrations against the government. You may face detention or deportation if you take part in a demonstration.

#### Terrorism

Members of a local terrorist group may still be in isolated areas throughout Peru, especially in the Central and Southern Highlands. This includes the Valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM) where drug traffickers operate.

Take care if you travel to:

* San Martin
* Huanuco
* Pasco
* Junin
* Ucayali
* Huancavelica
* Ayacucho
* Apurimac

These places may harbour members of the Shining Path terrorist movement, and incidents of domestic terrorism have occurred in the region.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in the Southern Highlands
* monitor the media for updates
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities
* report any suspicious activity or items to the police

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid areas affected in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Australians have died from injuries sustained in [adventure travel](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure") accidents in Peru.

Ziplining, rafting, diving, sand-dune buggy-riding and other adventure tour operators are not always regulated and don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.

The Inca Trail closes temporarily mostly in February, every year for maintenance. Some companies will still operate.

Heavy rainfall especially during the rainy season (November to May) can make parts of the trail impassable and dangerous.

If you plan to do an adventure activity:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

To reduce your risks:

* seek advice from local authorities
* adjust your plans if the weather makes conditions unsafe
* monitor weather conditions
* use an experienced guide on the Inca Trail or other treks

#### Tourism assistance or complaints

Contact your provider with any complaints about tourist services or products.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Peru can experience [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), such as:

* [flooding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#floods)
* [landslides](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#landslides)
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [volcanic eruptions](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#volcanos)
* [bushfires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#bushfires)

To protect yourself if a natural disaster is approaching:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with friends and family
* contact your tour operator or airline

**More information:**

* [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)

#### Flooding and landslides

Peru has a variety of climates. The rainy season is from November to May. Flooding and landslides are common in the Andes during this period. Rail, road and air services may be disrupted.

Heavy rain can cause flooding and landslides especially in the Andes mountain range, affecting tourist areas like:

* Machu Picchu
* the Inca Trail
* Aguas Calientes (Machu Picchu town)

This can result in travel delays.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Peru is in an active earthquake zone. Earthquakes and tsunamis can occur.

A tsunami can arrive very soon after a nearby tremor or earthquake.

Be alert to warnings.

If you're near the coast, move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. Once on high ground, monitor local media.

#### Volcanoes

Several volcanoes in southern Peru are active. Ubinas volcano in the Moquegua region and Sabancaya volcano in the Arequipa region have erupted multiple times.

Eruptions can occur at any time and without warning.

Exposure to volcanic ash, dust and toxic fumes can harm your health, especially if you have existing respiratory problems.

To protect yourself if there's an eruption:

* stay inside with windows and doors shut
* put damp towels at door thresholds and other draft sources if ash is falling
* monitor local media for advice on possible risks

If you need to go outside, avoid contact with ash. Wear a disposable face mask and change it frequently. Wear long clothing and goggles.

Seek local advice on recent volcanic activity before hiking or trekking near active volcanoes.

#### Bushfires

Bushfires can occur, especially in the dry season, from June to October. They affect the Andes and the Amazon. They can have an impact on air quality and can disrupt travel and tourist activities.

It is advisable to wear a face mask or to stay inside if the air quality is poor.
