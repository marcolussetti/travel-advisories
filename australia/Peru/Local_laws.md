# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Travelling with children

Children under 18 years old travelling on an Australian passport must obtain written permission (Autorización de Viaje Notarial) from the non-travelling parent(s) to leave the country. This applies if they have resident status or have stayed in Peru for over 183 days in one year. For more information, see the Peruvian government's [website](https://www.gob.pe/144-autorizacion-de-viaje-para-menores-de-edad).

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include lengthy prison sentences. Prison conditions in Peru are challenging. [Don't carry or use illegal drugs](/before-you-go/laws/drugs "Carrying or using drugs").

Trained staff use technology to detect illegal drugs at Lima's International Airport and throughout Peru.

Australians have been jailed for long periods for drug offences.

#### States of Emergency

Local authorities sometimes invoke a state of emergency. It gives the government special legal powers in response to civil unrest, crime, health concerns or natural disasters. Peru's armed forces can support the Police in the control of law and order. Some civil rights may be suspended and curfews imposed.

If a state of emergency happens in an area you're visiting:

* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

Information on states of emergency is published in the legal gazette [El Peruano official newspaper](https://diariooficial.elperuano.pe/Normas) (in Spanish).

#### Proof of identity

You must carry photo identification at all times. The Peruvian Police may ask to see it. Failure to show identification may result in detention.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to photograph military or police sites and personnel.

Indecent behaviour, such as not showing respect at cultural, historical or sacred sites, is against the law. Australians have been detained for this.

It's illegal to export handicrafts or goods of cultural or historical significance. If you want to buy or export copies of these, you'll need permission from Peru's National Institute for Culture. Call +51 1 321 5560.

It's also illegal to export antiques and artefacts from pre-colonial Peru. If you want to buy and export a reproduction, use a reputable dealer with the right documents.

Do not leave Peru with coca leaves, coca tea bags or similar products.

It is illegal to remove certain fauna and flora items from Peru.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you’re overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
