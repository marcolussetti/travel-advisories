## Overview

### Safety

* Political protests, demonstrations and strikes are common in Peru, particularly in the historic centre of Lima. Past demonstrations have turned violent and disrupted public transport services, including trains to and from Machu Picchu. Avoid protests, monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Robberies occur frequently on buses. Never place valuable personal belongings in overhead racks or under your seats, and ensure your possessions, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Use only reputable bus companies.
* Violent crime is common, including in Lima, Cusco and Arequipa. Avoid going out alone, especially at night. Petty crime is common in public areas, hotels and restaurants. Thieves are often well-dressed. Keep your belongings close and valuables out of sight. Street theft of mobile phones has increased. Avoid using your phone at the curbside, as motorbike riders may snatch it.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Travellers using unlicensed taxis have been victims of robbery, assault and rape. Don't hail taxis from the street. Use a phone dispatch service or taxi service app to book a licensed taxi. Criminals target cars stopped at traffic lights. Keep your doors and windows locked, even when moving.
* Ayahuasca tourism is a growing industry. Serious assaults, robberies and deaths have occurred. Thoroughly research Ayahuasca tour operators before you book.
* Members of a local terrorist group may still be active in remote areas, particularly the Southern Highlands. Take care when travelling outside of populated regions.

### Health

* Many parts of Peru are at high altitudes. You can develop altitude sickness above 2500m. If you plan to travel to these areas, consult your doctor before leaving. Ensure your travel insurance covers emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs.
* Peru is currently experiencing a major dengue outbreak. To protect yourself from mosquito-borne diseases, make sure your accommodation is insect-proof, use insect repellent and wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing. Consult your doctor before travel for advice on prevention and get advice if you become ill.
* Yellow fever is a risk in Peru. Get vaccinated before you travel. You will need a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter some countries after visiting Peru.  Zika virus is common in jungle regions. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor before you leave.
* Malaria is also a risk in Peru. Consult your doctor about how to prevent malaria.
* Other infectious diseases include cholera, hepatitis, tuberculosis, typhoid and rabies. Drink boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. If an animal bites or scratches you, get immediate medical help.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe and include lengthy prison sentences. Officials use up-to-date technology to detect drugs.
* You must carry photo identification at all times.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph infrastructure and military or police sites and personnel. If you're unsure, and local authorities are present, ask them before taking a photograph.
* Always behave respectfully. Indecent behaviour, including not showing respect at cultural, historical or sacred sites, is against the law. Authorities have detained Australians for this.
* It's illegal to export antiques and artefacts from pre-colonial Peru. If you want to buy and export a reproduction, use a reputable dealer who can provide the right documents.
* Dual nationals aged under 18 must travel with both of their passports. Children travelling with one parent or unaccompanied children must carry a notarial permit ('permiso notarial') from the non-travelling parent(s) to depart Peru. This applies if they have resident status in Peru or have stayed in Peru for over 183 days in one year.
