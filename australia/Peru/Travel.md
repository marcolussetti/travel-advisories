#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian tourists don't need a visa. You can get a permit to stay for up to 90 days when you arrive. The maximum stay permitted is 183 days in one year. If you overstay your permit, you'll have to pay a fine before leaving the country.

In other situations, you'll need to apply for a visa through an [embassy or consulate of Peru](https://www.embassy-worldwide.com/country/peru/).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You can contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Peru for the latest details. They'll tell you about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Border measures

International airports in Peru will not issue immigration entry or departure stamps. Only digital records will be kept of entry and exit from the country by air.

You can check the number of days you have been granted to stay legally in Peru, on the Peruvian Immigration Office [website](https://cel.migraciones.gob.pe/ConsultaTAMVirtual/VerificarTAM) (in Spanish).

If you enter Peru from Bolivia either by walking or by bus or taxi, you must make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the immigration office in Desaguadero or Copacabana (Puno region). You'll need to go to the immigration checkpoint, as they won't seek you out.

If you enter Peru overland from Ecuador, you must make sure your passport is stamped with a Peruvian entry stamp at the local immigration office. You may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. Most people crossing the border with Ecuador enter Peru through Aguas Verdes (Tumbes region). If your passport is not stamped at the border with Ecuador, you can have it stamped at the Immigration Office in the city of Tumbes.

If you haven't arranged an entry stamp to evidence your entry at land borders or seaports, you'll need to apply for an exit or expulsion order at the Immigration Office in Lima. You won't be allowed to leave Peru without this, and these orders may prevent you from re-entering Peru for up to 10 years.

Only cross the border at official checkpoints.

Ensure you also get an exit stamp from the country you're departing.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US, you must meet US entry and transit requirements.

Check your visa requirements with a [US embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212) well in advance of your travel.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Peru. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave. You will need a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter some countries after visiting Peru. [Check entry requirements before travelling](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations).

If you've visited Peru in the previous 6 days, you'll need a valid certificate to enter Australia.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever).

#### Passport

You need to have at least 6 months validity remaining in your passport to enter Peru.

Emergency travel documents can be used to enter, transit, or depart Peru as long as they have at least 6 months of validity from the moment of entry in Peru.

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport.](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/passport-services)

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).
* Your replacement passport will need a new entry stamp. For more information please visit the [Peruvian Immigration Office website](https://www.gob.pe/12664-trasladar-sello-de-ingreso-a-documento-de-viaje-nuevo-para-extranjeros) (in Spanish).

If you leave Peru with a replacement passport different from the passport you entered Peru (e.g., an emergency passport), you'll need to show a Police report for the loss of the previous passport to the Immigration officers at the moment of departure.

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Driving permit

You can use your Australian driver's license to drive in Peru for the duration of a tourist visa (maximum 183 days in one year). If you're staying in Peru longer, you'll need an International Driving Permit (IDP).

#### Road travel

Driving hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* aggressive local driving practices
* poor road lighting

Fatal traffic accidents are common and often involve intercity buses.

Armed criminals can target riverboats in the Amazon region.

Foreigners, including Australians, are assaulted and robbed every year on boats.
