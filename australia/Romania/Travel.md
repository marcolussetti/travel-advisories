#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You don't need a visa to enter as a tourist for up to 90 days. You'll need a visa for other types of travel.

Romania partially joined the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area") on 31 March. Border checks will cease between Romania and other Schengen countries for air or sea travel. 

Checks continue at land borders between Romania and other Schengen countries. 

If you're travelling without a visa, ensure your entire visit to the Schengen area, including your stay in Romania, is within the 90-day limit. This applies to all arrivals (air, land and sea).

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Romania](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/165) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

#### Travel with children

Special entry rules apply to children aged under 18 years, including Australian-Romanian dual nationals.

The child must be accompanied by an adult and have their own passport.

If you're a parent or guardian [travelling alone with a child](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children"), you must carry a legal permission document signed by the non-travelling parent.

If this isn't possible, you'll need:

* a death certificate of a parent registered on the child's birth certificate
* a court order granting sole custody to the travelling (or authorising) parent

The documents must be translated into Romanian.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Romanian Leu (RON).

Romania is a member of the European Union (EU).

Declare cash over 10,000 euros or equivalent if you're travelling between Romania and non-EU countries. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare or give incorrect information, you'll need to pay a fine.

You don't need to declare cash if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

Romania is largely a cash economy. However, credit card and debit card use is increasing.

It's illegal to change money on the streets. Exchange money at banks, large hotels or exchange bureaus.

#### Local travel

#### Accessibility

If you have a [disability](/before-you-go/who-you-are/disability "Advice for travellers with a disability"), you may encounter limited accessibility in some parts of Romania.

Public transport and building accessibility is better:

* in Bucharest and other large cities
* at international airports and large hotels

#### Driving permit

To drive in Romania, you'll need both:

* your current Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

If you stay longer than 185 days, you can apply for a Romanian driver's licence. Do this through the General Directorate for Driving Licences and Car Registration.

#### Road travel

Romania has the highest rate of road fatalities of all EU countries. Take care on the road.

Major city streets and inter-city highways are generally in good condition.

Most other roads are poorly maintained, badly lit and narrow.

Additional driving hazards include:

* poor driving standards
* wet and icy roads during winter
* stray dogs, wandering livestock and horse-drawn carts on the roads

If you need emergency roadside help, call 9271.

#### Road rules

Learn Romanian traffic laws before you drive. Be aware that:

* the minimum age for driving is 18 years
* children aged under 12 years can't sit in the front seat of a vehicle
* driving with a blood alcohol reading above 0% is illegal
* use of mobile phones while driving is banned. Only hands-free is permitted
* wearing a seatbelt is mandatory

If you drink and drive, you may:

* lose your licence
* face fines
* receive a prison sentence of up to 5 years

If you're involved in an accident, you must take a breathalyser test. Refusing to take this test is a crime.

Police strictly enforce traffic laws. They conduct frequent checks, including radar speed checks. You may lose your licence and have to pay a fine if caught.

You need a road toll sticker (Rovinieta) to use national roads. Buy one online or from petrol stations or border points. Driving without a sticker may lead to a fine.

#### Weather conditions

Road travel can be dangerous when roads are wet or covered with ice and snow.

Winter tyres are mandatory on snow-covered roads. Roads become snow-covered most often from November to March.

In extreme weather conditions:

* use tyre chains when driving
* check weather alerts on [meteoalarm](https://meteoalarm.org/en/)

#### Vehicle insurance

Ask your travel insurer whether your policy covers you if you plan to hire a car or other vehicle.

Also, ask if any restrictions apply. Your cover may only be valid if you're licensed for that vehicle type in Australia.

#### Motorcycles

Ask your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Authorised taxis are generally safe and reliable.

At airports, you can find them in ranks outside the arrivals terminal.

These vehicles:

* display taxi registration, licensing and tariff information
* have an airport sign on both sides of the vehicle

To avoid overcharging and other problems:

* only use authorised taxis
* avoid taxi service offers from touts at airports, train stations and other public places

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Romania's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YR) with the Aviation Safety Network.
