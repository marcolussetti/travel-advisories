## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel from Romania to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. The security situation continues to be volatile.
* Pickpocketing and bag-snatching occur. Thefts from hotel rooms are common. Assault and theft happen on intercity trains. Keep your personal belongings close. Lock hotel and train compartment doors from the inside.
* Drink spiking is an issue, especially in Bucharest's Old Town. Don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from people you've just met.
* Thieves posing as police officers may ask for your ID and wallet. Romanian police won't stop you at random to do this. If you suspect someone is posing as a police officer, ask for their identification.
* Financial, dating and marriage scams occur. Only use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres, especially at night. Always keep your credit card in sight. Be wary of people you've met online.
