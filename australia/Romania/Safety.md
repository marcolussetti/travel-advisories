# Safety

#### Border with Ukraine

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Missile strikes and attacks are ongoing in some locations across the country, including in major cities. There have also been attacks on Ukraine's Danube ports along the border with Romania. The security situation continues to be volatile. Do not travel from Romania to Ukraine. There's a risk to life.

If you have arrived in Romania from Ukraine and are in need of assistance, contact the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia.

#### Crime

Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can happen, usually:

* near hotels
* on public transport, especially to and from the airport
* in train stations
* in airport terminals

Organised groups of thieves target travellers. These groups may include children.

Thefts from hotel rooms are common.

Thefts and [assaults](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted) take place on intercity trains.

Drink spiking is an issue, especially in Centrul Vechi (the old town in Bucharest).

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep your personal belongings close, particularly near hotels and on public transport
* avoid walking in quiet and poorly lit streets, especially at night
* lock hotel and train compartment doors from the inside
* don't leave luggage unattended in your train compartment
* don't accept food, drinks, gum or cigarettes from people you've just met
* don't leave food or drinks unattended

#### Scams

Sometimes thieves pretend to be police officers and ask for ID and wallets.

Romanian police won't stop you at random to ask for your ID or wallet. However, they may conduct checks if you don't comply with local laws.

If you suspect someone is posing as a police officer:

* ask to see their identification
* don't hand over your personal belongings
* offer to go to the nearest police station with them to check their identity

Financial [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams), including credit card and ATM fraud, are common.

Internet fraud, including dating and marriage scams, also occur in Romania.

To reduce your risk of card theft and scams:

* only use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres, especially at night
* always keep your credit card in sight
* be alert to internet scams and other fraud
* be cautious if someone asks for your bank account details
* be wary of connections you make through internet dating schemes or chat rooms

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protests occur in Bucharest and other major cities.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

They may also disrupt services, traffic and public transport.

To stay safe:

* avoid demonstrations
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor local media

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Romania, they can still happen.

The US Embassy in Bucharest issued a security alert on 11 October about threats potentially targeting a synagogue, temple, or mosque in Romania. You should exercise increased caution near religious institutions.

In recent years, terrorists have attacked several European cities.

European security services have also disrupted several planned attacks.

To protect yourself:

* be alert to possible threats
* report anything suspicious to the police
* monitor the media for possible threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Torrential rain and [flash flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occurs in Romania. Take emergency alerts and official warnings seriously.

Serious [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") are rare, but Romania is in a seismically active region and earth tremors are common.

Wildfires are becoming more frequent in the summer months. Torrential rain and flash flooding can happen throughout the year.

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"):

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* keep in contact with your friends and family
* closely monitor the media and other local sources of information
* follow the advice of local authorities

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Tours and adventure travel

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes operators of adventure activities.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.
