# Overview

Latest update

We’ve reviewed our Ukraine travel advice and continue to advise do not travel due to the volatile security environment and ongoing military conflict. The security situation could deteriorate with little warning, posing a serious risk to life.  
  
If you're in Ukraine, be aware of your surroundings, review your personal security plans and monitor media for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. We encourage you to depart if it's safe to do so. Carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. Follow the advice of local authorities.   
  
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. The security situation continues to be volatile. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Missile strikes and attacks continue in various locations across the country, including in major cities. There have been many casualties. Foreigners have been killed and may be targeted. Large amounts of unexploded ordnance and landmines are present in conflict and post-conflict areas.  
  
Do not enter into new surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine.  
  
Our ability to provide consular assistance in Ukraine is severely limited. The Australian Embassy is not able to provide in-person consular or passport services (see 'Consular contacts'). If you have significant concerns for your welfare or that of another Australian, contact the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia.

## Overview

### Safety

* We continue to advise do not travel to Ukraine due to the volatile security environment and ongoing military conflict. The security situation could deteriorate with little warning, posing a serious risk to life.
* Russian strikes in Ukraine pose a continued threat to civilians and civilian infrastructure. Russian actions also pose a threat to Ukraine's active nuclear power plants, with particular concern for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
* The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. The security situation continues to be volatile. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Missile strikes and attacks are ongoing in some locations across the country, including in major cities.
* There have been civilian casualties. Foreigners have been killed and may be targeted. Your safety is at the highest risk if you engage in active combat. Australians on the frontline have been killed and captured by Russia. For more information on what to do if you're caught in armed conflict, see our general advice, [There's an armed conflict](/before-you-go/staying-safe/armed-conflict "Armed conflict").
* A nationwide state of emergency is in place, and martial law has been imposed. Other local restrictions may be implemented with little warning. Check the measures in place in your location, as they may vary from region to region and follow the instructions of the local Ukrainian authorities.
* If you hear a loud explosion or sirens are activated, seek shelter in a hardened structure away from windows. In some cities, subway stations may be available as shelters. Ensure you have an adequate supply of basic food, water and medications. Have a list of emergency contacts on you. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. Follow the advice of Ukrainian authorities and avoid areas where military forces are gathered.
* Where it's safe to do so, you should depart Ukraine. You need to consider the safest departure options carefully. Make contingency plans for how and when you're going to leave Ukraine. Roads may be crowded, exposed to military action or be damaged. Confirm the entry requirements of the [destination](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) to which you're travelling. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Ensure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication, and fuel. Keep your travel documents up to date, including for your immediate family. Continue to review your personal security plans. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.

### Health

* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.
* Infectious diseases include polio, tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rabies. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. If an animal bites or scratches you, seek immediate medical help.
* Chernobyl remains radioactive.
* Outside major cities, the standard of state medical facilities is low. There are frequent shortages of medical supplies. Russian military action could disrupt access to essential services, including healthcare.

### Local laws

* Always carry your passport. Local police or military may ask to see your passport and visa.
* Ukrainian males (including Australian/Ukrainian dual nationals) from 18 to 60 years of age are being stopped from leaving Ukraine.
* Ukraine doesn't recognise dual nationality. We may not be able to help you if you have Ukrainian nationality. Under Ukrainian law, you may be a Ukrainian citizen if you were born in Ukraine or have a parent born in Ukraine.
* Do not enter into surrogacy arrangements. Due to the Russian invasion, the security situation continues to be volatile and could deteriorate suddenly (see 'Safety'). If, despite our advice, you take part in commercial surrogacy arrangements, you'll need to travel to the nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate outside Ukraine, at your own expense, to obtain a travel document for your child. Your child must stay in Ukraine with appropriate care at your expense while you obtain the appropriate travel documents. The Australian Government can't evacuate you or your child from Ukraine.
* Australian law prohibits Australian citizens, residents, and holders of Australian visas from engaging in hostile activities overseas unless they are serving in the armed forces of a foreign country. If you travel to Ukraine to fight with a non-government armed group on either side of the conflict – or recruit another person to do so (including inducing, inciting or encouraging) – your activities may amount to criminal offences. Russian proxies have reportedly given foreign nationals extrajudicial death sentences for engaging in the war in Ukraine.
* Same-sex activity is legal in Ukraine, but local attitudes are less tolerant than in Australia. Violence has occurred at some gay pride events and gay venues in Ukraine.

### Travel

* The security situation continues to be volatile. A nationwide state of emergency is in place. Other local restrictions may be implemented with little warning. Check the measures in place in your location, as they may vary from region to region. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections.
* Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Ukraine's airspace is closed. Some roads may be crowded, exposed to military activity or damaged. Other transport options in Ukraine may close at short notice.
* New restrictions or changes to entry requirements for other destinations could be imposed suddenly. See the 'Travel' section for information on Ukraine border regions, land border crossing wait times, and rules for border crossing points.
* Plan for delays at land border crossings. Ensure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication, and fuel supply. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family.
* Ensure your registration, ownership, insurance, and Green Card are in order for border crossings. Carry identification with you at all times and communicate with family and friends about your travel plans. Expect delays on roads and disruptions to services, including communications and transport. Be prepared for weather conditions.
