#### Visas and border measures

We continue to advise do not travel to Ukraine.

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If, despite our advice, you travel to Ukraine, you can enter without a visa for visits of up to 90 days within 180 days.

To apply for temporary, long-term or permanent residency, contact the [State Migration Service of Ukraine](http://en.migraciya.com.ua/contacts/).

#### Border measures

Entry requirements are subject to frequent change.

You must have valid health insurance to enter Ukraine. Check the [Visit Ukraine](https://visitukraine.today/) website before travelling.

#### Border issues

You need to carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. Roads, including bridges and facilities, may be crowded, exposed to military action or damaged. Plan for delays at land border crossings. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice.

Ensure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication, and fuel. Use your judgement to decide the best time and safest means of exit. If you judge it's safe to leave Ukraine and travel by road, check the entry requirements for where you travel, such as [Poland](/destinations/europe/poland "Poland"), [Romania](/destinations/europe/romania "Romania"), [Moldova](/destinations/europe/moldova "Moldova"), [Slovakia](/destinations/europe/slovakia "Slovakia") and [Hungary](/destinations/europe/hungary "Hungary"), for more information. Be aware that some borders may close without notice.

If you judge it's safe to depart Ukraine, see the following websites on land border crossing wait times and rules on border crossing points:

* [Waiting time at cross-border points](https://kordon.customs.gov.ua/en)
* [Visit Ukraine](https://visitukraine.today/)
* [State Border Guard Service of Ukraine](https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/map)

#### Other formalities

Contact an [embassy or consulate of Ukraine](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/208) about what you must declare with customs on arrival and departure. If you take more cash than is allowed, officials may confiscate it.

Undeclared items may be confiscated.

Customs rules control the export of:

* currency
* antiques
* art
* items of historical significance

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)
* Due to the security situation, the Australian Embassy is not able to provide in-person consular or passport services in Ukraine.
* Obtaining a replacement passport may take extra time. You'll need to travel to the nearest Australian embassy or consulate outside Ukraine, at your own expense and risk, to obtain a travel document.

#### Children

Ukrainian citizens aged under 16 years need consent from both parents to depart Ukraine unaccompanied. This includes dual nationals. See [Local laws](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/ukraine#local-laws)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH).

ATMs are available, and credit cards are widely used in cities. However, due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ATMs might not be refilled with cash, and some bank cards might not be accepted. During power cuts, ATMs and card terminals may not work.

Outside major cities, carry enough cash in local currency.

There's a risk that cyber-attacks could disrupt mobile, internet and banking services.

Contact an [embassy or consulate of Ukraine](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/208) for updates on how much cash you can take in and out of the country. If you take more cash than is allowed, officials may confiscate it.

#### Local travel

#### MH17 crash site

In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down near Hrabovo in the Russian-controlled part of Donetsk province.

Do not travel to this area due to ongoing armed conflict in the surrounding vicinity.

#### Driving permit

You'll need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Ukraine. 

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

When you drive, you must carry the following:

* original vehicle registration papers
* ownership documents
* insurance papers.

You'll need to show them at border crossings or if stopped by police. This includes rental vehicles.

When crossing a border in a private vehicle, you'll need to carry a Green Card to prove you have the minimum insurance required by the country you're driving in. You may be able to obtain a Green Card at the insurance company offices at some border crossings, or you should contact your insurance provider. 

Read more information from the [Ukrainian Government on border crossing](https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/border-crossing-by-foreigners-and-stateless-persons/) or call the SBGSU Hotline on 1598 from a Ukrainian mobile.

If you decide to leave Ukraine by road, check the travel advice on [Smartraveller](https://smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) for the safety risks and entry requirements of the country you're entering.

#### Road travel

Driving in Ukraine can be dangerous. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, roads may be crowded, exposed to military action or damaged; this extends to bridges and facilities. See 'Safety'.

Hazards include:

* poorly lit and maintained roads
* aggressive or speeding drivers
* drivers who ignore road rules
* drunk drivers
* ice and snow
* unsafe vehicles on rural roads.

It's common to park on footpaths.

Driving with a blood alcohol reading above 0% is illegal.

Check your travel insurance covers you before driving in Ukraine.

Don't expect vehicles to stop for you or to follow road rules.
