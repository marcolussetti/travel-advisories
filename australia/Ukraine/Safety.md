# Safety

#### Security situation

We continue to advise do not travel to Ukraine due to the volatile security environment and military conflict. There is a risk to life. If you're currently in Ukraine, we urge you to depart if it's safe to do so.

If you hear a loud explosion or sirens are activated, seek shelter in a hardened structure away from windows. Subway stations may be available as shelters. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. Ensure you have an adequate supply of basic food, water and medications. Have a list of emergency contacts on you and screenshot any online content you may need to refer to in case of a communications or digital blackout. Review your personal security plans. Follow the advice of local authorities and monitor advice on Smartraveller and reputable local and international media about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. 

Russia has launched intensified attacks against Ukraine's civilian and Government infrastructure. Attacks are ongoing. Russian strikes in Ukraine pose a continued threat to civilians and civilian infrastructure. Russian actions also pose a threat to Ukraine's active nuclear power plants, with particular concern for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. The security situation continues to be volatile. Heavy fighting is occurring in some areas of Ukraine. Missile strikes and attacks are ongoing in various locations across the country, including in major cities. Rocket, drone, and missile attacks have struck infrastructure and civilian and military facilities. There have been many casualties. Foreigners have been killed and may be targeted. Your safety is at the highest risk if you engage in active combat.

The US Government issued travel advice reporting US citizens being singled out and detained by the Russian military in Ukraine. This may occur when citizens are forcibly deported or evacuated by land through temporarily Russian-occupied territory or to Russia.

A nationwide state of emergency is in place. Other local restrictions may be implemented with little warning. Check the measures in place in your location, as they may vary from region to region. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections. Follow the instructions of the local Ukrainian authorities.

When it's safe to do so, you should leave Ukraine. Carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. Large amounts of unexploded ordnance and landmines are present in conflict and post-conflict areas. Follow the advice of local authorities about where these areas are and avoid them.

Communication infrastructure may become damaged or blocked, and cyber-attacks have occurred. Contact your family and friends to let them know your travel plans and where and how you are. 

#### Leaving Ukraine

Where it's safe to do so, you should depart Ukraine. Use your judgement to decide the best time and safest means of exit. Transport routes may be disrupted. Ukrainian airspace is closed. 

Plan for delays at land border crossings. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Make sure you have an adequate supply of food, water, medication and fuel.

Continue to read the travel advice of your destination to make sure you meet the entry requirements, as these may differ when entering by road or rail. Be aware that some borders may close without notice. Any travel options you pursue are taken at your own risk.

In most cases, Australians departing Ukraine must present a valid Australian passport.

#### Consular assistance

If you need consular assistance or you have significant concerns for your welfare or that of another Australian, contact the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 outside Australia.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has severely limited our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians, and you should not expect increased consular support. The Australian Government will not be able to evacuate you from Ukraine. Subscribe and follow the advice on the Smartraveller website and [social media](/about-us/social-media "Social media").

If, despite our advice, you remain in Ukraine:

* follow the advice of Ukrainian authorities.
* keep your passport and other travel documentation safe.
* contact your friends and family in Australia so they’re aware of your location, situation and any travel plans.
* make contingency plans to leave as soon as you judge it’s safe to do so.
* stay in a safe place and limit your movements. Ensure you have supplies of food, water, batteries, money and other essentials.
* adopt effective personal security measures. Always be alert and aware of your surroundings.
* shelter in a hardened structure, and stay away from windows. Identify the location of the closest bomb shelter.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Ukraine continues to be volatile. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Large demonstrations took place in Kyiv before Russia's full-scale invasion. They took place around the Maidan Nezalezhnosti, St Michael's Square, outside the Presidential Administration, Parliament and other government offices.

Civil unrest can cause road closures and disrupt local transport.

Political unrest can occur in Ukraine without warning. Actions include occupying public areas and government buildings or blockages of roads by large groups of people.

Be aware of protests from November to March to mark the anniversaries of the Maidan Revolution.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid large gatherings
* check local media
* follow advice from Ukrainian authorities

**More information:**

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Serious crime targeting foreigners isn't frequent.

[Robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"), pickpocketing and bag snatching occur:

* on public transport
* at crowded markets
* in popular tourist areas
* in bars and nightclubs

Street crime and muggings increase at night.

To protect yourself from crime:

* pay close attention to your belongings
* carry only what you need
* leave valuables in a safe location
* take extra care at night

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams

Be careful with your credit card. [Scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") such as card skimming and those related to using ATMs occur.

Street scams are very common. Criminals often target foreigners.

Beware of bogus internet friendships, dating and marriage schemes from Ukraine.

If a virtual friendship develops, you may be asked by your new friend or prospective partner to send money so they can travel to Australia or pay bills. In some cases, the relationship ends with very little chance that any money can be recovered.

Be wary of any dating or marriage proposals from people you meet online.

Online scammers may also claim to be stuck at a Ukrainian hospital, airport or an isolated place and need money to leave. They will often reference the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. They regularly make false claims about being Australian citizens. 

We can't offer advice on specific schemes.

To avoid scams:

* use ATMs in banks and reputable international hotels
* avoid ATMs that open onto the street, especially at night
* always keep your credit card in sight
* be wary of anyone asking for bank account details or personal data
* be wary of people you meet online who then begin asking for money

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. There is an increased risk in Ukraine. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media. 

#### Cyber attacks

In December 2023, there was a major cyber attack on Ukrainian networks. Ukraine's largest mobile network provider was affected, leaving millions of users without a mobile signal or the ability to use the internet. It also disrupted air raid apps, some banks and ATMs.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.
