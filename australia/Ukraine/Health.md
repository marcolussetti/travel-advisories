#### Travel insurance

Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Ukraine. Do not travel to Ukraine. See '[Safety](#safety)'

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Do not travel to Ukraine. If, despite our advice, you travel to Ukraine, consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical or mental health condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you depart Australia.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Ukraine. Take enough legal medicine for your trip, plus a contingency supply owing to the volatile security situation in Ukraine.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use.

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

Tick-borne diseases, including [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) (World Health Organization), are a risk in forested areas.

Ticks are common from spring to autumn (March to December) in Ukraine.

To protect yourself from disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing.

Check your body for ticks during and after visiting forests.

Remove ticks from your body as soon as you can.

#### Measles

Measles cases can routinely occur in Ukraine, with the country currently experiencing an increase in measles activity. Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before travelling.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk for travellers.

Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Polio

Due to low vaccination rates in Ukraine, [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) poses a serious risk to young children.

Check your [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) vaccinations are up to date before you travel. You may need a booster dose.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [diphtheria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diphtheria)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If an animal bites or scratches you, seek medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Radiation poisoning

A catastrophic nuclear accident occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986. It spread radioactive material across northern Ukraine and beyond. Radioactivity remains a risk in and around the plant.

#### Medical care

The standard of state medical facilities is low outside major cities, such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa and Lviv. There are frequent shortages of medical supplies. Russian military action could disrupt access to essential services, including healthcare.

Private healthcare services are of a better standard. You'll need to guarantee payment before they'll treat you.

Medical staff outside of major centres often don't speak English, except in private clinics. Reports, prescriptions and other documents won't be in English.

If you become ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
