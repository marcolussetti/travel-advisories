#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australians in need of consular assistance should contact the Australian Government 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre:

Russian military action in Ukraine has severely limited our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians. It will not always be possible for the Australian Government to assist you. The Australian Government will not be able to evacuate you from Ukraine.

For all visa enquiries, see the [Ukraine page](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-and-support/ukraine-visa-support) on the Department of Home Affairs website.
