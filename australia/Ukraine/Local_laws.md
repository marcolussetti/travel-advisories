# Local laws

#### Local law

Always carry your passport.

Local police may stop foreigners and ask them to see their passports and visas.

Ukrainian males (including Australian/Ukrainian dual nationals) from 18 to 60 years of age are being stopped from leaving Ukraine. Military conscription is occurring.

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.

#### Surrogacy

Do not enter into surrogacy arrangements. Due to the Russian invasion, the security situation continues to be volatile and could deteriorate suddenly. Missile strikes and attacks are ongoing across the country, including in major cities. There's a risk to life.

Some surrogacy agencies have been prevented from fulfilling their contractual obligations since Russia's invasion, causing a significant increase in costs for the intended parents. Ukrainian Government agencies may take longer than you expect to issue documents.

If, despite our advice, you take part in commercial surrogacy arrangements, the Australian Government can't evacuate you or your child from Ukraine. Russian military action in Ukraine has severely limited our ability to provide consular and passport assistance to Australians. It won't always be possible for the Australian Government to assist you.

You may need to spend time in Ukraine before and after the birth. You'll need to travel to the nearest Australian embassy or consulate outside Ukraine, at your own expense and risk, to obtain a travel document for your child. Your child must stay in Ukraine with appropriate care at your expense while you obtain the appropriate travel documents. Be aware of all legal and other risks involved.

Surrogacy is regulated by Ukrainian law. Get independent legal advice.

The Australian embassy can't provide the following:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics.

If, despite our advice, you choose to enter Ukraine, make sure you have up-to-date visas and passports. Subscribe and follow the advice on the Smartraveller website and [social media](/about-us/social-media "Social media").

You need to consider the risks when entering and departing Ukraine carefully. Any travel options you pursue are at your own risk. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. The Australian Government can't advise on the safety of travelling to departure points.

If you're in Ukraine, make sure you have plans to leave Ukraine as soon as it's safe to do so. If your departure plan involves a vehicle, see '[Travel](#travel)'.

#### Australian laws

Australian law prohibits Australian citizens, residents, and holders of Australian visas from engaging in hostile activities overseas unless they are serving in the armed forces of a foreign country. Australians on the frontline have been killed and captured by Russia. Foreigners have been killed and may be targeted. Your safety is at the highest risk if you engage in active combat.

Do not travel to Ukraine. There is a risk to life. If, despite our advice, you travel to Ukraine to fight with a non-government armed group on either side of the conflict – or recruit another person to do so (including inducing, inciting or encouraging) – your activities may be criminal offences. Russian proxies have given foreign nationals death sentences in the Donetsk region for engaging in the war in Ukraine.

Russian military action in Ukraine has severely limited our ability to provide consular and passport assistance to Australians. It won't always be possible for the Australian Government to assist you. The Australian Government will not be able to evacuate you from Ukraine.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Ukraine doesn't recognise dual nationality.

Under Ukrainian law, you may be a Ukrainian national if you were either:

* born in Ukraine, or
* have a parent born in Ukraine.

We may be unable to help you if you're in Ukraine and have Ukrainian nationality.

Male citizens over 18 years old may be conscripted.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that you won't be granted a tourist visa if you're considered to be a Ukrainian national.

Speak to the [embassy or consulate of Ukraine](http://en.migraciya.com.ua/contacts/) before you travel.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships are legal in Ukraine. However, public attitudes are less tolerant than in Australia.

Violence has occurred at some LGBTQIA+ pride events and venues in Ukraine.
