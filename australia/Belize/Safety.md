#### Violent crime

Violent crime that may affect foreigners in Belize includes [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault"), [rape](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") and [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Violent crime sometimes happens in tourist hotspots, including:

* San Pedro
* Caye Caulker
* San Ignacio Corozal
* Placencia

Gang violence is a major problem in Belize, especially in the Southside of Belize City (south of Haulover Creek Canal). Gang members often use weapons to resolve disputes. Clashes occur frequently between gangs to gain control over territories for illegal activities. You should avoid these areas.

Police capacity to respond to violent incidents is limited, and many crimes remain unsolved.

Muggings are common, especially in Belize City and other urban centres.

Armed robberies can happen around the Mayan ruins at Caracol and near the border with Guatemala.

Your risk of harassment and violent sexual assault increases when you travel alone. Security risks increase after dark.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* don't carry more cash than you need
* use a reputable tour company
* don't travel alone, especially after dark
* pay close attention to your surroundings
* keep vehicle windows closed, doors locked and valuables out of sight, including when driving
* use the media to stay informed about safety or security risks

To reduce your risk of crime when taking a taxi:

* use only licensed taxis, identified by green number plates
* don't let your taxi driver pick up extra passengers

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially rape, get immediate medical attention. Belize has a high HIV/AIDS infection rate.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.
