#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Following the hijacking of a small passenger aircraft on 17 April 2025, the Belize Department of Civil Aviation has announced enhanced security measures are being implemented at all local airports. You should arrive early at airports to allow enough time for security procedures.

Belize has an online immigration and customs declaration system. You will need to complete and submit an entry form before travelling to Belize. You can access the [e-form](https://belizetravel.immigration.gov.bz/Belize_Digital_Forms/) via the [Belize Tourism Board](https://www.travelbelize.org/).

#### Tourist visas

Australians don't need a visa for visits of less than 30 days.

If you stay more than 30 days in Belize, the local immigration office must re-stamp your passport and you will pay a fee.

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact [Belize Immigration](https://immigration.gov.bz/) or your nearest [Embassy, Consulate or High Commission of Belize](https://belizehighcommission.co.uk/) for the latest details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Travel via the United States

If you're travelling through the US to Belize, you must also meet US entry or transit requirements.

#### Other requirements

The cost of your airline ticket usually includes a departure tax. If not included, you must [pay](https://www.belizeadventure.ca/travel-tips/departure-tax/) a departure tax in cash (USD $55.50)

You may need extra documents if only one parent or guardian is travelling with a child. Contact your nearest [Embassy, Consulate or High Commission of Belize](https://belizehighcommission.co.uk/) to confirm this.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

All travellers over the age of 1 arriving or transiting countries with a risk of yellow fever need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Belize. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Belize Dollar (BZD). US dollars are also accepted.

You can travel with up to $BZ10,000. You must declare higher amounts.

You can only use credit cards and traveller's cheques in large tourist facilities.

Before you travel, check with your bank whether your cards will work in Belize.

#### Local travel

Belize has an ongoing border dispute with Guatemala. When crossing the border:

* use official border crossings
* avoid travelling at night
* pay attention to your surroundings

After heavy rains and flooding, you can become stranded in the jungle.

If you plan to visit the jungle, use a reputable tour operator and check local weather conditions.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Belize, you need an International Driving Permit (IDP). This permit is valid for 3 months.

You must get the IDP before arriving in Belize.

For longer stays, apply for a local driver's licence from the Belize Department of Traffic.

#### Road travel

Driving in Belize can be dangerous. You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Belize than in Australia.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* local driving practices, including drink driving
* poor street lighting
* cyclists running red lights and ignoring road rules
* unpaved and flooded roads
* single-lane bridges on highways

There are no emergency road services. Fuel stations aren't common and close on public holidays.

If you plan to drive in Belize, always keep your fuel tank full in remote areas.

Check you have adequate travel insurance cover before driving.

#### Motorcycles

Avoid using motorcycles because maintenance standards are poor.

Your travel insurance policy may not cover you when riding motorbikes, quad bikes or other vehicles.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Licensed taxis in Belize have green licence plates. Only use licensed taxis. Arrange taxis or limousine services through your hotel to avoid unlicensed operators.

#### Public transport

If using public transport, be aware that buses may be poorly maintained. Service may be unreliable in rural areas.

#### Sea Travel

Water taxis operate between the islands (cayes), barrier reef attractions and the mainland.

They can be overloaded, poorly maintained or lack necessary life-saving equipment.

Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards.

To reduce your risk, ensure any vessels are carrying proper safety equipment and life jackets for all passengers.
