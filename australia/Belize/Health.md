#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including if stopovers on the way to your destination are covered)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to take medication, check if it's legal in Belize. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

You could be refused entry or prosecuted if you arrive without a prescription for your medication.

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Cases of [Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) occur in Belize. The Pan American Health Organisation reports an increase in dengue cases in the Region of the Americas, including Belize, in 2023 and early 2024.

If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas.

The risk of contracting insect-borne illnesses increases in the wet season from April to November.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Belize City are basic. Medical facilities are very limited or non-existent in rural areas.

You may need to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to the US. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
