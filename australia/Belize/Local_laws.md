# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison sentences in local jails. In 2017, Belize decriminalised the use of marijuana on private property for adults in possession of up to 10g. However, it remains a federal offence to sell, grow or smoke it on public property. It’s best not to buy or sell marijuana in Belize.
