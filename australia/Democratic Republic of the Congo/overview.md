## Overview

### Safety

* We've reviewed our travel advice for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and have raised the travel advice. We now advise do not travel overall due to the volatile security situation and the threat of conflict, violent protests, terrorism and kidnapping.
* The security situation in the DRC is volatile across the country. Conflict between government forces and armed groups in the east is escalating. The security situation in and around Goma is deteriorating, and airspace closure is possible. The security situation in other regions of Eastern DRC may deteriorate with no warning.  If it's safe to do so, leave affected areas.
* Violent demonstrations and protests may occur in Kinshasa and other locations, including outside some foreign embassies and UN offices. Avoid areas where protests are happening. Curfews may be imposed with little notice. Roadblocks and road closures may occur without warning.
* If you're in an affected area, shelter in place until it's safe to leave. Always exercise extreme caution. Arrange effective personal safety measures and ensure travel documents are up to date. Monitor local media for updates.
* Crime rates are very high, especially in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and in the east of the country. Risks increase after dark. Ensure your accommodation is secure. Don’t walk alone in Kinshasa, even during the day.
* Kidnappers often target foreigners. The risk is highest in the eastern and northeast regions. Express kidnappings in parts of Kinshasa have increased. If you're travelling to these areas, seek professional security advice. Be alert to possible threats.
* There's an ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in the DRC, particularly in eastern DRC. An attack is possible at any time. Always be alert to potential threats, especially in public places.
* Military administrations have replaced civilian administrations in Ituri and North Kivu until further notice. The military administrations have been granted extended security powers, and there is potential for increased armed conflict in these provinces during this time.
* There's a high level of intercommunal violence in Mai Ndombe province, particularly in the territory of Kwamouth. Intercommunal violence may continue to increase and lead to further deaths and displacement.
* The DRC has active volcanoes. If there's an eruption, avoid contact with ash. Seek medical help if you have breathing problems. In the rainy season, landslides and flooding can disrupt transport networks. Be prepared to change your travel plans.

### Health

* There's currently an outbreak of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa, including in the DRC. Mpox can be fatal. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox (see ‘Health risks’).
* Several outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have occurred in DRC. There is an ongoing risk of EVD transmission in the DRC. EVD is often fatal. Avoid contact with EVD patients as the disease is spread through bodily fluids.
* Ensure you've been vaccinated against yellow fever and polio before you travel. Carry proof of vaccination with you.
* HIV/AIDS is widespread. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Some insect-borne disease such as yellow fever and malaria are widespread. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof and use insect repellent.
* Foodborne, waterborne and other infectious diseases include cholera, typhoid, hepatitis and monkeypox. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water.
