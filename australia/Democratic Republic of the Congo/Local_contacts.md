#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in the DRC. Our ability to provide consular assistance may be limited.

The [Canadian Embassy](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/democratic_republic_congo-republique_democratique_congo/kinshasa.aspx?lang=eng) in Kinshasa provides consular assistance to Australians in the DRC. It can issue Australian [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents). Its services are limited outside Kinshasa.
