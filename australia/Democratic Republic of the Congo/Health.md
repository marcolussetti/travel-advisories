#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a special insurance policy for any 'do not travel' destinations. Some Australian policies may not cover you for these areas.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may be illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the DRC. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current Mpox outbreak in parts of Africa as a global public health emergency. It has now spread across a number of countries in Africa, including in the DRC.

Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, infected animals or contaminated materials.

Symptoms include:

* rash
* fever
* sore throat
* headache
* muscle aches
* back pain
* low energy
* swollen lymph nodes

Seek professional medical advice on Mpox vaccines.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid physical contact with anyone who has Mpox.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and isolate from others if you develop any Mpox symptoms.

#### Ebola virus disease (EVD)

Several outbreaks of [Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease) have occurred in DRC. There is an ongoing risk of EVD transmission in the DRC.

EVD is often fatal with a mortality rate of around 50 per cent.

Symptoms of EVD can include:

* high fever
* muscle pain and weakness
* headache
* sore throat
* vomiting and diarrhoea
* internal and external bleeding

Approved vaccines are currently only administered during a confirmed outbreak to those considered at highest risk of contracting the virus. They're not available to the general public as a preventative measure at this point in time. There's no proven safe and effective treatment but prompt and high-quality care can be lifesaving.

EVD spreads through direct contact with body fluids, even after an infected person has died. EVD can also be transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of those who have survived and recovered from infection.

Maintain strict hygiene standards. Avoid direct contact with EVD patients.

See a doctor if you feel unwell and separate yourself from others if you develop any EVD symptoms.

Call ahead and tell the doctor about your recent travel and symptoms. Advance notice will help the doctor treat you and protect others.

See the Australian Government [Department of Health and Aged Care](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/ebola-resources) for more information on how to protect yourself against catching EVD, and what to do if you’re in an area where EVD is known to happen.

#### Polio

Outbreaks of [polio](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis) have occurred.

Stay up-to-date with polio vaccinations and booster doses. Speak to your doctor if you're unsure if you're vaccinated for polio.

If you're staying longer than 4 weeks, you'll need to show proof on exit that you've had the polio vaccine or a booster within the past 12 months. If you don't, you may need to be vaccinated before leaving the DRC.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-communic-factsheets-yellow.htm) is widespread in the DRC.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs widely throughout the year.

Other insect-borne diseases can also occur, including:

* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [plague](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague)
* [African sleeping sickness](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trypanosomiasis-human-african-(sleeping-sickness))

To protect yourself from disease:

* check your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel.

Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is widespread. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are widespread. These include:

* [Cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [Typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [Hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [Meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid swimming in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs, monkeys, rodents and other animals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Public medical facilities are basic in Kinshasa and inadequate outside the capital. Private medical facilities are of higher quality but may not meet Australian standards.

Doctors and hospitals will generally ask for payment before treatment. Evidence of travel insurance may not be accepted as a guarantee of payment at some hospitals.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll likely need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be expensive.
