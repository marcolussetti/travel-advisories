#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You'll need a visa before you enter the DRC. You can't get one on arrival.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You can contact the nearest embassy or consulate for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

The closest [embassy of the DRC](https://embassyofdrcongo.com/) is in Tokyo.

#### Border measures

Some airlines have suspended flights to and from Kinshasa. Other options to depart the DRC may close with no warning.

Border openings and other restrictions may change at short notice. Due to the ongoing insecurity in these areas, you should avoid the border entry points from Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic.

Contact your airline directly for the latest update and register with the [Canadian Embassy](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/democratic_republic_congo-republique_democratique_congo/kinshasa.aspx?lang=eng) in Kinshasa for advice on departure options.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter DRC. You may be asked to show your vaccination certificate before boarding, on arrival and at departure.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Other entry requirements

Declare satellite phones and GPS equipment on arrival.

A departure tax applies if you leave the DRC by air. The tax includes a $50 airport exit fee and a $5 boarding fee, which is subject to change with no notice. Get an official receipt and copies for each fee. You should hand the originals on request to immigration officials and at boarding and keep the copies.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

The [Canadian Embassy](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/democratic_republic_congo-republique_democratique_congo/kinshasa.aspx?lang=eng) in Kinshasa can issue Australian [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents)(PTDs). You can't travel to or through South Africa on a PTD.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Congolese Franc (CDF).

Declare local and foreign currency in excess of USD10,000 on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

US dollars are widely accepted. Counterfeit currency is common. Check USD banknotes before accepting them.

Change currency at licensed commercial banks and exchange bureaus. Money transfer agencies operate in major towns.

Traveller's cheques aren't accepted. Some major hotels accept credit cards.

ATMs are available in Kinshasa and major centres. It may be difficult to withdraw cash from international accounts, even at major hotels.

Check that your cards will work in the DRC before you travel.

#### Local travel

#### Mining districts

You'll need official clearance from the relevant DRC ministry or government department before visiting a mining district.

#### Driving permit

To drive in the DRC, you'll need both:

* a valid international driving permit (IDP)
* your current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in the DRC than in Australia. Dangers include:

* aggressive driving
* low driving standards
* poor roads
* a lack of street signage and lighting

Military and police roadblocks are common.

Following large-scale prison breaks in Kinshasa, Béni and Kasangu, local authorities increased the number of checkpoints at night. Checkpoints include Gombe, Limete, Ngaba, Kintambo, Ngaliema, Ndjili, Mont Ngafula and around Camp Kokolo.

Criminals may use roadblocks to pose as police or military personnel and rob you (see [Safety).](#safety)

To protect yourself while travelling on DRC roads:

* familiarise yourself with local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to possible hazards, especially at night
* check road conditions and risks before travel outside Kinshasa
* follow advice from local authorities

Carry government-issued identification, carte rose, carte grise and driver's licence at all times.

Ask for credentials if approached by an officer.

If you travel outside Kinshasa, have contingency plans and take emergency equipment such as a satellite phone.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines, preferably arranged through your hotel.

Avoid unofficial taxis or taxis hailed on the street. [Robberies](/node/344) can occur.

#### Public transport

Don't use public transport. Bus and rail services are unsafe due to poor safety standards and crime.

#### Boat travel

Many [boats and ferries](/node/359) are overloaded, lack lifesaving equipment and aren't seaworthy.

Kinshasa's main ferry terminal is congested and can close at short notice. Pay attention to your personal security in and around the terminal.

#### Air travel

Civil unrest may cause flight cancellations to and from Kinshasa at short notice.

Local immigration and customs procedures at Kinshasa Airport are difficult. You may need help from people familiar with the process. If travelling by air, arrange for them to meet you when you arrive.

Pay attention to your personal security in and around the airport.

Avoid local airlines with poor maintenance and safety standards.

Aircraft in and around Goma, North Kivu have reported experiencing interference with GPS flight systems. Some flights have been delayed, cancelled or rerouted. Monitor media, airlines' website and local authority advice for flight information in or out of Goma International Airport.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check the [DRC's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9Q) with the Aviation Safety Network.
