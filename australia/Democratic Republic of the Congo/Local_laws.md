# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for possessing illegal drugs include harsh prison sentences and fines.

#### Other laws

A number of offences carry the death penalty.

Always carry a copy of your passport and visa or immigration permit. Police and immigration officials can ask to see your travel documents at any time.

Same-sex relationships are not illegal in the DRC. Homosexuality remains a cultural taboo and same-sex couples who engage in public displays of affection may be subject to harassment. Same-sex relationships are not recognised in the DRC.

Curfews can be imposed with little or no warning.

Pedestrians and motorists must stop for motorcades. Warnings include security personnel and sirens.

You must also stop when passing a government installation during the raising and lowering of the national flag. This happens at about 7:30am and 6pm every day.

In the DRC it's illegal to:

* take photos of or near government buildings or other infrastructure, including airports
* take photos of a presidential or other official motorcade
* fail to produce your passport and visa or immigration permit on request

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The DRC doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/node/117) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

You need to enter and exit the DRC using the same passport or you may be stopped from departing.

Always travel on yourÂ [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").
