#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is volatile across the country. 

Conflict between government forces and armed groups in the east has escalated. The security situation in and around Goma has deteriorated and closure of airspace is possible. The security situation in other regions of Eastern DRC may deteriorate with no warning.

There are over 130 active armed groups in eastern DRC. Armed conflict has caused widespread civilian displacement and deaths. Conflict between local armed groups and government forces is ongoing. It's a more serious threat in eastern and northern provinces. This includes:

* Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental provinces
* South Kivu, North Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganyika, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé provinces where fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people
* Mai Ndombe province

In the eastern provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, military administrations have replaced civilian administrations until further notice. The military administrations have been granted extended security powers, and there is potential for increased armed conflict in the region during this time.

A large UN military presence and several aid organisations operate in the DRC. This includes the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). On 25 July 2022, large protests began in the cities of Beni, Betembo, Goma and Rutshuru targeting MONUSCO. MONUSCO sites have been looted and the demonstrations have resulted in deaths. Avoid crowds, demonstrations and sites associated with MONUSCO in eastern DRC.

Some non-government organisations have suspended operations in North and South Kivu due to the security situation.

Intercommunal violence in Mai Ndombe province, particularly in the territory of Kwamouth, has escalated. Intercommunal violence may continue to increase and lead to further deaths and displacement.

If you're in an affected area:

* Shelter in place until it's safe to leave
* Always exercise extreme caution
* Arrange effective personal safety measures
* Monitor local media for updates

Keep your passport and other travel documents (e.g. visas, flights) up to date and secure.

Regularly review your contingency plans in light of local developments. If you travel to DRC despite our advice, be ready to leave at short notice if the situation worsens. You should also seek professional security advice.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Civil unrest and political violence can occur in Kinshasa, including outside some foreign embassies and UN offices. Protesters may start fires and thrown rocks at vehicles. Foreigners may be randomly targeted.

Public protests and events that draw large groups can quickly turn violent.

To protect yourself from violence:

* avoid demonstrations and protests
* limit your movements
* monitor local media and other information sources for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to shelter in place if necessary and depart if safe to do so.

Security incidents can occur in Kinshasa, including:

* riots
* demonstrations
* attacks on vehicles

During periods of unrest, the only road to the N'Djili Airport in Kinshasa may be blocked. Flight schedules may be disrupted. Confirm flight schedules with your airline or travel provider.

Curfews may be imposed with little notice. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnappings can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is a very high risk across DRC, it’s most common in the eastern and north-eastern regions.

Areas with a high risk of kidnapping include:

* Virunga National Park in North Kivu
* Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental provinces
* South Kivu, North Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganyika, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé provinces

Kidnappers have engaged in highway ambushes to target foreigners. Aid and humanitarian workers have been kidnapped regularly in these areas.

Express kidnappings targeting foreigners have increased. The threat is particularly high in the Limete area of Kinshasa.

These attacks usually occur in broad daylight and victims can be abducted for a few hours and stripped of their possessions or taken to an ATM to withdraw money.

These attacks are often perpetrated by small groups of individuals dressed in police uniforms.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of being kidnapped:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* if you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

There's a very high level of crime in the DRC. Risks increase after dark.

Criminals may use roadblocks and pose as police or military personnel to rob travellers at night.

Security authorities may target travellers to ask for bribes or make random arrests, such as at roadblocks.

Violent crime has increased in the east because of the unstable security situation.

Crimes that commonly affect travellers, especially in Kinshasa, include:

* [violent robbery](/node/344)
* [vehicle thefts](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")
* [burglaries](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [carjacking](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

To protect yourself from crime and express kidnappings:

* keep vehicle doors locked and windows up
* secure your accommodation against intruders
* avoid travelling after dark
* don't walk alone in Kinshasa
* avoid sensitive areas, such as military facilities
* don't permit soldiers or police officers to enter your vehicle, and avoid getting into vehicles with strangers, even if they identify themselves as police officers
* avoid using taxis. If you must take one, don't hail off the street, use a privately booked taxi
* be extra vigilant when withdrawing cash from ATMs, even in hotels.

Carry colour photocopies of your passport and identity documents. Hand these to officials, not the originals.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

There's an ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in the DRC, particularly in eastern DRC. An attack is possible at any time. Always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

Areas prone to terrorist attacks include:

* in the region of Beni-Butembo and Goma in North Kivu
* in the vicinity of Boga in Ituri
* the border with Uganda

Possible targets for terror attacks include:

* government buildings and sites associated with the DRC armed forces (FARDC)
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs
* schools and places of worship

To reduce your risks:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* be alert in crowded places and monitor the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously and follow the instructions of local authorities
* consider the level of security at venues you're visiting
* pay close attention to your personal security

If there's a terrorist attack, leave the affected area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This also applies if you're evacuated from a building for security reasons, such as a bomb threat.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

The DRC experiences earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mount Nyiragongo, near Goma, is one of the world's most active volcanoes and last erupted in May 2021.

Exposure to volcanic ash, dust and toxic fumes is a major health risk.

Seek medical help if you have existing respiratory problems.

To protect yourself if there's a volcanic eruption:

* stay inside with the windows and doors shut
* place damp towels at doors and other draft sources
* protect your skin with long-sleeved clothing and long pants
* wear a disposable face mask outside and change it frequently
* protect your eyes with goggles
* avoid contact with ash

#### Floods and landslides

Landslides and flooding may occur in the rainy season. This can affect transport infrastructure.

The rainy season is April to October in the north and November to March in the south.
