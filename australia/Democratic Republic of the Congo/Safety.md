#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is volatile across the country. 

Since January 2025, conflict between government forces and armed groups in the east is escalating. The security situation in and around Goma is deteriorating and closure of airspace is possible. The security situation in other regions of Eastern DRC may deteriorate with no warning.

There are over 130 active armed groups in eastern DRC. Armed conflict has caused widespread civilian displacement and deaths. Conflict between local armed groups and government forces is ongoing. It's a more serious threat in eastern and northern provinces. This includes:

* Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental provinces
* South Kivu, North Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganyika, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé provinces where fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people
* Mai Ndombe province

In May 2021, the DRC Government declared a 'State of Siege' in the eastern provinces of Ituri and North Kivu. Military administrations have replaced civilian administrations in these provinces until further notice. The military administrations have been granted extended security powers, and there is potential for increased armed conflict in the region during this time.

A large UN military presence and several aid organisations operate in the DRC. This includes the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). On 25 July 2022, large protests began in the cities of Beni, Betembo, Goma and Rutshuru targeting MONUSCO. MONUSCO sites have been looted and the demonstrations have resulted in deaths. Avoid crowds, demonstrations and sites associated with MONUSCO in eastern DRC.

Some local non-government organisations have suspended operations in North and South Kivu due to the security situation.

Intercommunal violence in Mai Ndombe province, particularly in the territory of Kwamouth, has escalated. Intercommunal violence may continue to increase and lead to further deaths and displacement.

If you're in an affected area:

* Shelter in place until it's safe to leave
* Always exercise extreme caution
* Arrange effective personal safety measures
* Monitor local media for updates

Keep your passport and other travel documents (e.g. visas, flights) up to date and secure.

Regularly review your contingency plans in light of local developments. Be ready to leave the DRC at short notice if the situation worsens.

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel, get professional security advice.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Since 28 January, civil unrest and political violence has been occurring in Kinshasa, including outside some foreign embassies and UN offices. Protesters have started fires and thrown rocks at vehicles. Further protests are expected and may also spread to other parts of DRC. Foreigners may be randomly targeted.

Public protests and events that draw large groups can quickly turn violent.

To protect yourself from violence:

* avoid demonstrations and protests
* limit your movements
* monitor local media and other information sources for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities
* be prepared to shelter in place if necessary and depart if safe to do so.

Security incidents can occur in Kinshasa, including:

* riots
* demonstrations
* attacks on vehicles

The only road to the N'Djili Airport in Kinshasa may be blocked. Flight schedules may be disrupted. Confirm flight schedules with your airline or travel provider.

Curfews may be imposed with little notice. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

Kidnapping is most common in the eastern and north-eastern regions of DRC.

Areas with a high risk of kidnapping include:

* Virunga National Park in North Kivu
* Kasai, Kasai Central and Kasai Oriental provinces
* South Kivu, North Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganyika, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé provinces

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

Express kidnappings targeting foreigners have increased. The threat is particularly high in the Limete area of Kinshasa.

These attacks usually occur in broad daylight and victims can be abducted for a few hours and stripped of their possessions or taken to an ATM to withdraw money.

These attacks are often perpetrated by small groups of individuals dressed in police uniforms.

To reduce the risk of being kidnapped, you should:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

There's a very high level of crime. Risks increase after dark.

Criminals may use roadblocks and pose as police or military personnel to rob travellers at night.

Security authorities may target travellers to ask for bribes or make random arrests, such as at roadblocks.

Violent crime has increased in the east because of the unstable security situation.

Crimes that commonly affect travellers, especially in Kinshasa, include:

* [violent robbery](/node/344)
* [vehicle thefts](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")
* [burglaries](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [carjacking](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

To protect yourself from crime and express kidnappings:

* keep vehicle doors locked and windows up
* secure your accommodation against intruders
* avoid travelling after dark
* don't walk alone in Kinshasa
* avoid sensitive areas, such as military facilities
* don't permit soldiers or police officers to enter your vehicle, and avoid getting into vehicles with strangers, even if they identify themselves as police officers
* avoid using taxis. If you must take one, don't hail off the street, use a privately booked taxi
* be extra vigilant when withdrawing cash from ATMs, even in hotels.

Carry colour photocopies of your passport and identity documents. Hand these to officials, not the originals.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing threat of terrorist attacks in the DRC, particularly in eastern DRC. An attack is possible at any time. Always be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

Areas prone to terrorist attacks include:

* in the region of Beni-Butembo and Goma in North Kivu
* in the vicinity of Boga in Ituri
* the border with Uganda

Possible targets for terror attacks include:

* government buildings and sites associated with the DRC armed forces (FARDC)
* areas frequented by foreigners, such as hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars and markets
* airports, other transportation hubs and vehicle convoys
* schools and places of worship

To reduce your risks:

* take official warnings seriously and follow the instructions of local authorities
* consider the level of security at venues you're visiting
* be alert in crowded places and monitor the media
* pay close attention to your personal security

If there's a terrorist attack:

* leave the affected area immediately if it's safe to do so
* avoid the area afterwards in case of more attacks

Don't gather in groups after an attack. This also applies if you're evacuated from a building for security reasons, such as a bomb threat.
