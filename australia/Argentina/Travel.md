#### Visas and border measures

​​​​​

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Argentina](https://cancilleria.gob.ar/en/representaciones) for details about visas, currency and customs regulations.

#### Visa-free travel for short stays

As a tourist, you can stay for up to 90 days without a visa, but you'll need evidence that you intend to depart the country within the 90 days, for example:

* a return or onward ticket
* a valid passport
* travel/medical insurance

Officials may also ask for proof of accommodation and evidence that you have enough money or a credit card to cover your trip.

If you are travelling on a passport other than a regular passport (for example, official, diplomatic or emergency) and/or for a reason other than tourism, you may require a visa. Please contact the nearest Argentine Consulate/Embassy for further information and to apply for a visa.

Visas aren't available on arrival. You must obtain your visa before you travel.

#### Entry into Argentina

Biometric entry procedures are in place at:

* Ezeiza International Airport
* Jorge Newbery International Airport
* Buenos Aires ferry terminal

On arrival at these ports, authorities will:

* scan your thumbprints with an inkless device
* take a digital photo of you

Argentina immigration official may not stamp your passport on entry or exit. Should you require evidence of entry/exit, click [here](https://www.migraciones.gov.ar/transitos/) to fill out a form on the migration agency website. 

#### Travelling with children

Children younger than 18 years may need to provide an authorisation or a letter of consent from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who aren't travelling with them.

Children younger than 18 years who normally reside in Argentina or have resided in the country for one year or more need legal authorisation from the non-accompanying parent(s) to leave the country if travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian.

Children younger than 13 years must have a translated and apostilled authorisation to enter the country if one or both parents and/or legal guardian(s) are not travelling with them.

When a child is travelling with both parents, be prepared to prove you're the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (birth certificate or court documents). Parents of children younger than 18 years who were born in Argentina or normally reside in Argentina need to prove they’re the parents when leaving Argentina.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport.](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services")

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the [nearest embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The Peso (ARS) is the official currency of Argentina. Most major hotels in Buenos Aires will exchange US dollars. They may not accept traveller's cheques. Check local sources for advice on buying foreign currency.

Credit/debit cards are widely accepted. You should carry a photocopy of the identity page of your passport or a photo ID in case you are required to prove you are the owner of the card.

Don't exchange money on the street, or with someone offering exchange services on the street. You may receive counterfeit pesos or become the victim of a crime.

#### Local travel

#### Hiking

Be prepared if you're hiking or climbing in high country or mountains.

To reduce your risks if you intend to hike in Argentina:

* register your details with local park authorities
* give details of your plans and contact details to family or close friends
* research the area you plan to visit, including any natural hazards
* monitor local media for weather advice
* carry emergency and first aid equipment with you
* wear proper clothing and take with you the necessary equipment for the activity. In mountainous areas and in Patagonia the weather can change abruptly.
* stay on marked trails

#### Iguazu Falls

If you intend to make a day trip to the Brazilian side, make sure you meet the entry/visa requirements. 

Ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Brazil.

See the [Brazilian Government’s website](https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/embaixada-camberra/English/consular-section/visas/visit-visa) to learn about entry and visa requirements for Australian citizens

Be cautious when crossing the tri-border area between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, as criminal activities are common. Avoid crossing the borders after dark.

#### Driving permit

You can use your Australian driver's licence while you have a valid visa. You should check with the rental car company whether you also need to have an international driver permit. You may need to present further identification.

Residents must get an Argentine driver's licence.

Drivers must be aged 23 years or older to hire a car.

#### Rail travel

Petty crime is common in trains and subways and in railway stations.

When travelling on public transportation you should carry your backpack or purse on your chest, not on your back.

#### Taxis

It is more secure to book radio taxis and 'remises' (chauffeured cars):

* by telephone
* at the airport arrivals hall
* on official mobile apps

To reduce your risks if you take a taxi:

* book taxis in advance rather than hailing on the street
* use ride-hailing apps which maintain a record of the driver and the route and often don't require a cash transaction
* don't share with strangers
* keep doors and windows locked and valuables out of sight.

#### Air travel

Overbooking on domestic flights, technical problems at the airport, protests and strikes are common in Argentina and can result in:

* significant delays
* missed connections

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Argentina's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=LV) with the Aviation Safety Network.

If you're flying within Argentina, monitor local media for airport updates.
