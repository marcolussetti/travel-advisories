#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your travel or medical insurance policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including hospital admission and medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

You may not be able to access your usual medication in Argentina. Some local alternatives:

* don't meet Australian standards
* may have adverse effects

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Argentina. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Diseases spread by insects are a risk in Argentina. These include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)
* [Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) (regional)

These diseases are serious and can be fatal.

Outbreaks can happen throughout the year and as far south as Buenos Aires, particularly when warm weather combines with rainfall. There has been a severe dengue outbreak across northern and eastern Argentina, including Buenos Aires.

Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[US CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/argentina) recommends yellow fever vaccinations for all travellers going to Corrientes and Misiones provinces.

Zika virus is a risk in the northern areas of Argentina.

Pregnant women and their unborn babies are particularly at risk. If you're pregnant:

* discuss any travel plans with your doctor
* defer non-essential travel to affected areas

To protect yourself against diseases spread by insects:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medication to prevent malaria if you travel to the north of Argentina

#### Hantavirus

Infected rodents spread [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/index.html). It's widespread in:

* northern regions of the provinces of Salta and Jujuy
* central regions of the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Rios
* the northeast region of the province of Misiones
* northern Patagonia, in the provinces of Neuquen, Rio Negro and Chubut

To protect yourself from hantavirus infection:

* avoid contact with live or dead rodents, burrows or nests
* avoid places where dust is raised, such as from sweeping and vacuuming their droppings
* choose a campsite that is open and dry
* don't rest in tall grasses or haystacks
* remove food sources that may attract rodents

#### Altitude sickness

If you travel to an area higher than 2500m, you can develop altitude sickness.

Altitude sickness can be deadly. It can affect anyone, even if you're physically fit.

Your risk of altitude sickness increases if you:

* ascend too quickly
* have had altitude sickness before
* exercise or drink alcohol before you can adjust to the altitude
* have health problems that affect breathing

If you'll be travelling above 2500m:

* seek advice from your doctor before you travel
* obtain travel insurance that covers mountain rescue

#### Air pollution

Buenos Aires has high levels of air pollution. This may aggravate:

* bronchial conditions
* sinus conditions
* asthma
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

#### Other health risks

Outbreaks of waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur. This includes:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

To reduce your risk of illness:

* boil drinking water or drink bottled water in rural areas
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Get urgent medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Most medical facilities are of a reasonable standard. Medical services can be limited in remote areas.

You may need to pay cash before private medical clinics will treat you. This includes for emergency care.
