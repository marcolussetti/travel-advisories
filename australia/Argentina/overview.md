## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime, including robbery and bag snatching is common. Take care on public transport and in tourist areas or crowded places. Thefts and robberies in Buenos Aires and other major cities are increasing. Popular tourist areas such as La Boca, San Telmo and Palermo are hotspots for robberies and theft. Always keep personal belongings, including mobile phones, secure or out of sight. Don't leave wallets or mobile phones on tables in restaurants, especially if you're seated on sidewalks.
* Exercise a high degree of caution in the city of Rosario due to higher levels of crime and violence.
* Violent crimes occur in Buenos Aires, Rosario and Mendoza tourist areas. These may include armed robbery. Only use ATMs in banks and shopping centres and try to avoid them after dark. If you're held up, don't resist.
* Thieves often target cars stopped at traffic lights. Crime also occurs in taxis. Keep doors and windows locked when driving.
* Protests, demonstrations and other disruptions such as strikes, may occur anytime. Peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Avoid large public gatherings.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases are common in the north of Argentina and as far south as Buenos Aires. These include dengue, chikungunya and zika virus. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor before you leave. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Yellow fever is a risk in Misiones and Corrientes. If you're travelling there, get vaccinated before you leave Australia.
* Hantavirus is widespread in some regions, particularly in northern Patagonia. It's spread through contact with infected rodents. Avoid contact with live or dead rodents, nests, burrows and droppings.
