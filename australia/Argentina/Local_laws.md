# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe, even for small amounts, and include long prison terms.

#### Surrogacy

If you plan to take part in commercial or altruistic surrogacy arrangements in Argentina, be aware of all legal and other risks involved. Research prospective agencies and clinics to ensure that you're dealing with a reputable organisation.

Get comprehensive and independent legal advice from an Argentine lawyer with specialisation in this area of law. 

There's no specific current legislation that regulates surrogacy and all surrogacy arrangements are subject to ongoing developments in Argentine law. This applies to both the surrogacy arrangements as well as administrative procedures such as issuing of birth certificates and travel arrangements for babies born through surrogacy. 

Argentine authorities may consider surrogacy arrangements to be illegal. Criminal investigations into surrogacy agencies, and associated service providers, including medical clinics, legal advisers and notary publics have occurred. Be aware if there are any local legal issues surrounding your surrogacy arrangement, authorities may stop you entering the country, or your child leaving. You need to find out which visa is appropriate for you. You may wish to seek legal advice from an Argentine lawyer with specialisation in this area of law.

The Australian Government can't intervene in visa or border clearance decisions of another country. Seek legal advice in your destination.

On 22 October 2024 the Supreme Court of Argentina ruled that the name of the surrogate (the woman who carried the child) must be included on the child’s birth certificate as one of the two listed parents.

Spanish is the official language in Argentina, and you may need to engage the services of a translator for several differing scenarios, including engaging with your lawyer and medical provider. 

The Australian Embassy can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics or agencies
* translation/interpretation services

You may need to spend several months in Argentina before and after the birth, to complete Argentine processes. Don’t confirm travel plans until you’ve finalised Australian citizenship and passport processes. If unforeseen legal complications arise, this period could be considerably prolonged.

#### Dual citizenship

Dual nationals staying in Argentina for more than 180 days must leave Argentina on an Argentine passport.

Applying for an Argentine passport can take time. You must present documents proving your identity. If you're an Australian resident, you may have to provide proof of your address in Australia.

The Australian Embassy can't help you apply for an Argentine passport or other identity documents.
