#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Croatia is a part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). Get a clear stamp on your passport when you enter the Schengen Area for the first time.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Croatia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/51) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border with Slovenia

Temporary border checks have been introduced at Croatia's borders with Slovenia. You should allow extra time to cross the border between Croatia and Slovenia and be ready to show your passport or residency card if asked by the border police. Checks may also involve vehicle inspections. Border checks between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia remain in place.

You can enter Croatia without a visa in some cases. In other situations, you'll need to get a visa.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. 

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Croatia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/51) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/our-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Croatia's currency is the euro (EUR).

If you're travelling to or from any non-EU country, declare cash of more than 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you fail to declare it or give wrong information, you'll be fined and the funds may be confiscated.

You don't need to declare currency if you're travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Local travel

#### Delays at borders

There's been an increase in the number of migrants and refugees entering Europe.

Delays at land border crossings may occur. Allow extra time if you're travelling by road or train.

* have back-up plans
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Unexploded landmines

Unexploded landmines and remnants of war are a serious problem in parts of Croatia. Clearance operations are ongoing.

If you visit former conflict areas, don't leave known safe roads and safe areas.

Check details on known and suspected mine areas with the [Ministry of Interior, Civil Protection Directorate](https://civilna-zastita.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/145) (Croatian) before you travel.

#### Driving permit

To drive a vehicle, you'll need both:

* a current Australian driver's licence, and
* a valid international driving permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

If you plan to live in Croatia, you must exchange your Australian driver's licence for a Croatian one within 12 months of arrival. You can do this at the local police station.

#### Road travel

Driving can be hazardous, and traffic accidents are common.

In winter, severe weather can make roads icy and slippery.

Many country roads are narrow and lack guardrails.

Aggressive drivers may overtake when it's not safe to do so.

According to local road rules, you must:

* always use headlights from the last weekend in October until the last weekend in March
* use headlights during fog and rain
* have winter tyres fitted on motor vehicles between 15 November and 15 April

It's illegal to use a mobile phone while driving.

Motor vehicles must carry a fluorescent vest. You must wear this vest while attending to a breakdown.

Police may fine drivers and cyclists involved in accidents, even when no third parties are involved.
