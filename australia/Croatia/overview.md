## Overview

### Safety

* There's been an increase in bomb threats against public areas, such as shopping malls, government offices and schools. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Be careful if you attend soccer matches and avoid protests and demonstrations.
* Don't jump off rocks and cliffs along the coast. Party boats and other venues, such as nightclubs, might have different safety standards than Australia.
* Earthquakes, floods and landslides can occur. Forest fires are common from June to September. Monitor the media for updates.

### Health

* Health care on the mainland is generally good. Services on the islands are limited. It can be expensive if you need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.
* There are decompression chambers in Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka and Pula.
* Take care in forests. Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) ('mouse fever'), Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis are risks.
* West Nile virus can occur. There's no vaccine to prevent it. Use insect repellent. Make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.

### Local laws

* Police issue on-the-spot fines for some minor offences. They may hold your passport if you challenge them or don't pay.
* In some popular tourist areas, it's prohibited to drink alcohol in public spaces, outside bars and restaurants. You could get an on-the-spot fine.
* Dress codes apply. Police may fine you if you're shirtless or wearing swimwear in towns with signs banning this. Disorderly and drunken behaviour is penalised.

### Travel

* Croatia is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). In some situations, this lets you enter Croatia without a visa.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025.
* Temporary border checks have been introduced at Croatia's borders with Slovenia. You should allow extra time for crossing the land border between Croatia and Slovenia.
* Croatia's official currency is the euro.
