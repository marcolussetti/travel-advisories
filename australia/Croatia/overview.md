## Overview

### Safety

* On 5 July, a major music concert will be held at the Zagreb Hippodrome. Authorities are expecting large crowds, with up to 500,000 people expected to attend the event. If you're in Zagreb see our advice on [going overseas for a major event](/before-you-go/major-events "Going overseas for a major event") page to understand the extra precautions you may need to take.
* There's been an increase in bomb threats against public areas, such as shopping malls, government offices and schools. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Be careful if you attend soccer matches and avoid protests and demonstrations.
* Don't jump off rocks and cliffs along the coast. Party boats and other venues, such as nightclubs, might have different safety standards than Australia.
* Earthquakes, floods and landslides can occur. Forest fires are common from June to September. Monitor the media for updates.

### Health

* Health care on the mainland is generally good. Services on the islands are limited. It can be expensive if you need to be evacuated. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.
* There are decompression chambers in Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka and Pula.
* Take care in forests. Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) ('mouse fever'), Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis are risks.
* West Nile virus can occur. There's no vaccine to prevent it. Use insect repellent. Make sure your accommodation is insect-proof.
