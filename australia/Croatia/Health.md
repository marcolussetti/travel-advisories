#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

There are limits on the types and amount of some medications you can take into Croatia. Standard medication can be imported in quantities needed for personal use for up to one month.

If you plan to bring medication, check with the [Ministry of Finance Customs Administration](https://carina.gov.hr/featured/information-for-passengers-natural-persons/bringing-in-medicine-and-narcotics/6745).

Carry a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) is a risk in forested areas.

Ticks are most common in country areas. They're active from spring to autumn.

Cases of [West Nile virus](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) have occurred in Croatia. There's no vaccine for it.

To protect yourself from illness:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

To reduce your risk of tick-borne disease:

* check your body for ticks during and after visiting forests
* remove ticks as soon as possible, making sure to remove the whole tick
* monitor the tick site for signs of infection

#### Hantavirus

[Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)](https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs/index.html), commonly known as 'mouse fever', is a risk in forested areas. It's caused by hantaviruses. Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents and are more common in warmer months.

To reduce the risk of mouse fever:

* avoid contact with rodents and their droppings
* avoid sitting or lying on the ground when in forests
* keep your food and drinks in closed containers
* don't drink from forest springs

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of health care on the mainland is generally good, but services on the islands are limited.

Public hospital facilities may not be to the same standard as Australian hospitals.

Private hospitals and clinics have facilities for some services but often cost more.

Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka and Pula have decompression chambers.

If you're injured or become seriously ill on an island or remote area, you'll be evacuated to a regional centre for treatment. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Dual nationals are not automatically covered by the Croatian health insurance system or entitled to free access to health services through the Croatian Healthcare fund. Prior registration and monthly contributions/payments are required to gain access and coverage.
