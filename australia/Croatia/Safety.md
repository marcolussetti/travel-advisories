#### Terrorism

While there's been no recent terrorist attacks in Croatia, they can still happen.

There's been an increasing number of bomb threats against public areas, such as shopping malls, government offices and schools. Monitor the media for developments and follow the advice of local authorities.

In recent years, terrorists have staged attacks in European cities. Targets have included:

* public transport
* transport hubs
* public places popular with tourists

Security services have stopped some planned attacks.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* be alert to possible threats in public places
* take care near possible terrorist targets
* monitor the media for updates
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

Report any suspicious behaviour or items to the police.

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, is common. Take extra care:

* in busy tourist areas
* at bus and railway stations
* on public transport
* at the beach

Drink spiking can happen and may lead to theft and [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault).

To protect yourself from crime:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* don't leave your food or drink unattended
* look after your belongings, particularly in crowds

Men's clubs in coastal centres have been known to overcharge tourists. They may threaten violence and use security guards to make you pay. Check prices before ordering.

Report incidents of extreme overcharging and related threats or violence to local police.

While violent crime is rare, isolated attacks may occur, including at sporting events.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. This includes sporting events. Be careful if you attend soccer matches.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid protests and demonstrations
* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Adventure activities

#### Partying

Croatia is a popular party destination, but partying carries safety, legal and financial risks.

Accidents have occurred on party boats, resulting in serious injuries. The safety standards may be different to Australia. Nightclub fires, balcony collapses, and crowd crushes can occur.

Uniformed and plain-clothed police patrol music festivals in Croatia. Drug and other antisocial behaviour-related arrests are common.

Locals don't like rowdy and drunken behaviour in public places.

Being drunk or under the influence of drugs may void your travel insurance.

Dress codes apply in some popular tourist areas. Police may fine you if you're shirtless or wearing swimwear in towns with signs banning this.

#### Cliff jumping

Jumping off rocks and cliffs into the sea along the coast of Croatia can cause injuries. Warning signs aren't always in place.

Many accidents occur in Split, Dubrovnik and in the Dalmatian Islands.

Your travel insurance may not cover you if you:

* cliff jump
* dive
* engage in other dangerous activities
* were intoxicated, and this caused or contributed to an accident

#### Trekking or rock climbing

It's not uncommon for tourists to find themselves in need of rescuing from the Croatian mountains because they're not prepared.

If you intend to trek or rock climb:

* never do so alone, and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company
* buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation
* ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity
* ensure that you're properly equipped and well-informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard
* obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out, and do not venture off marked trails

#### Climate and natural disasters

Croatia experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

The country is in an active [earthquake](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis) zone.

[Forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") are common in the dry, hot coastal areas and on the islands from June to September. Avoid affected areas.

Flooding can happen throughout the year, triggering landslides, and damaging buildings, roads and other infrastructure. This can disrupt road travel.

To protect yourself if there's a natural disaster or severe weather:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor media and other sources for updates
* keep in regular contact with friends and family
* follow the advice of local authorities

Safety barriers aren't always in place in some tourist areas. Care should be taken when walking on uneven, slippery surfaces, including old cobblestone streets.
