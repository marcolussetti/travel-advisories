# Local laws

#### Local law

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Possessing, using or trafficking illicit drugs is illegal.

If you're arrested for a drug offence, police may detain you while they investigate.

Penalties include imprisonment.

#### On-the-spot fines

Police issue on-the-spot fines for some minor offences, including traffic violations. They may detain you and/or hold your passport if you:

* challenge the offence
* can't pay the fine

#### Property laws

Foreigners buying property have been involved in lengthy disputes about the validity of property titles. Seek independent legal advice before signing any contracts.

#### Other laws

You must carry an ID, such as your passport, at all times.

You must register your stay in Croatia with the local police within 48 hours of arrival. If you're staying at a hotel or a tourist facility, the accommodation provider will register you.

Drinking alcohol in public areas, outside bars and restaurants, and in popular tourist areas such as Split and Dubrovnik is prohibited.

Signs warning of prohibited behaviours, including drunken and disorderly behaviour, have been put up, and on-the-spot fines are issued. Dress codes apply. Police may fine you if you're shirtless or wearing swimwear in towns with signs banning this.

#### Court holidays

Court staff take holidays over the summer. If you're detained at that time, you may face delays in having your case processed. You may not be able to leave Croatia until the matter is finalised.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Croatia recognises dual nationality and treats dual nationals as Croatian citizens.

Croatia is considering re-introducing compulsory military service in 2025. Under existing arrangements, male Croatians, including dual nationals, must report to defence authorities to register their details when asked to do so. Failure to report is an offence.

Seek advice from an [embassy or consulate of Croatia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/51) on the specific registration requirements before you travel.

**More information:**

* [Ministry of Defence](https://www.morh.hr/en/)

If you're an Australian-Croatian dual national and intend to stay for over 3 months, you may need to provide evidence of your Croatian citizenship.

Dual nationals aren't automatically covered by the Croatian health insurance system (see 'Health').
