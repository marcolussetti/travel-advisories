# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Some parts of Niger are not under the control of the government, meaning that militant groups in those areas may dictate what laws and standards apply.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs can include heavy fines and/or long jail sentences in Niger.

#### Other laws

The death penalty applies to serious crimes, such as murder.

Always carry your passport with a valid visa or residence permit.

NGOs must register with the Government of Niger before they start their mission. If you work without permission, you could be detained and deported.

It's illegal to take photos of:

* military personnel, zones and assets
* radio and television stations
* airports
* the Presidency Building
* diplomatic buildings
* the Kennedy Bridge in Niamey
* political demonstrations

#### LGBTQIA+ information

It's illegal to perform what the law calls an 'unnatural act' with a person of the same sex and who is under 21. This is punishable by a fine and up to three years in prison.

Same-sex relationships are otherwise legal in Niger. However, there is a strong stigma against them within the local community and no local recognition of same-sex couples.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Niger doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you enter Niger with a Nigerien passport, local authorities will treat you as a Nigerien citizen. This limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

#### Local customs

Respect religious and cultural customs and laws.

Ask for permission before taking photos of locals.

#### Dress standards

Standards of dress and behaviour are generally conservative. Take care not to offend.

If you're a woman, consider wearing a headscarf and loose clothes that cover your arms and legs, especially where locals are doing so.

If you're not sure, get local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Niger.

It's illegal to eat, drink and smoke in public during daylight hours in Ramadan. If you're not fasting, avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of people who are.
