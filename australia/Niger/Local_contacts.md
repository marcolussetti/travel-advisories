# Local contacts

#### Emergencies

Depending on what you need, in the first instance, you should contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline
* hotel

#### Fire and rescue services

Call 18.

#### Medical emergencies

Call 15 or 20 72 31 41 and ask for an ambulance or go directly to a hospital. Ambulances may be slow to respond.

#### Police

Call 17 or 20 72 25 53 or go to the nearest police station.

These phone numbers often go unanswered, especially outside normal working hours. Sometimes, police may be slow to respond to reports of criminal activity or may not investigate them at all.

Always try to get a police report when you report a crime.

Your insurer should have a 24-hour emergency number.

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Niger.

You can access limited consular services from the Australian High Commission in Nigeria. The Australian High Commission in Abuja has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in Niger.
