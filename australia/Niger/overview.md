## Overview

### Safety

* There's ongoing political instability in Niger following a military takeover in July 2023. Protests and civil unrest could occur and turn violent quickly without notice. Avoid government buildings, demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. The overall security situation remains highly volatile, and movement restrictions may be implemented at short notice.
* There's a high risk of terrorism in Niger. Terrorists could target foreigners and the places they visit, including hotels, cafes, restaurants, government buildings, and security facilities. Avoid possible targets, be alert to threats and take official warnings seriously.
* There's a high risk of kidnapping across Niger, especially outside Niamey. Foreigners have been targeted. In early 2025 there were two separate incidents in which foreigners were kidnapped from their homes. You could be kidnapped from your residence, vehicle or workplace.
* If you do decide to travel to Niger, consider engaging professional security advice and arrange personal security measures.
* Violent crime, including armed home invasions, carjacking and mugging, is common. Don't travel alone. Travelling after dark brings increased risk.
* Some land borders remain closed, and others may close without warning. Trying to leave Niger by land borders is likely to be dangerous. Do not travel to several countries neighbouring Niger, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Libya, and Chad. We also advise do not travel to the border areas with Algeria, Nigeria and Benin.
* If you decide to stay in Niger, limit your movements and avoid protests. Keep a supply of water, food and medicine.

### Health

* Yellow fever and malaria are common. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Get vaccinated against yellow fever before you travel. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* The HIV/AIDS infection rate is high. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include cholera, rabies, hepatitis, polio and bilharzia. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water. Ensure your polio vaccinations are up to date.
* Medical facilities in Niamey, including emergency help, may be limited and poor quality. Outside the capital, they're inadequate or non-existent. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation.
* Get full travel insurance that covers medical costs and evacuation. You'll probably need a special policy that covers travel to high-risk places. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Niger.

### Local laws

* Don't use, carry or traffic illegal drugs. Severe penalties include heavy fines and long prison sentences, especially in areas where Islamic militants are implementing Sharia law.
* Always carry your passport with a valid visa or residence permit.
* Be careful when taking photos. Photographing military and government buildings, personnel, key infrastructure, and political demonstrations is illegal. Ask permission before taking pictures of locals.
* Niger doesn't recognise dual nationality. If you enter the country on your Nigerien passport, authorities will treat you as a Nigerien citizen. Always travel on your Australian passport.
* Dress and behaviour standards in Niger are conservative. Always dress and act appropriately.

### Travel

* If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger, you'll need a visa to enter the country. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Niger for the latest details.
* You must show your yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter the country.
* Authorities have been conducting increased security checks on foreigners arriving in Niger by air. This may result in your passport being held by authorities for several days when you arrive in Niger.
* Some land ports of entry may be closed due to security considerations. Several roads in Niger are closed for travel, except with special authorisation. Without these authorisations, you could be arrested and deported.
* Landmines are a risk throughout the country. Drive only in daylight and drive in a convoy with adequate security.
* Taxis are old and in poor condition. Don't use public transport due to poor road conditions and the risk of violent crime. Hire a private car with a professional driver and consider engaging appropriate security support.
* If you travel outside Niamey, you must be escorted by Nigerien security or military forces.
