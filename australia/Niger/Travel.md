#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger, you'll need a visa in advance of travel to enter the country.

#### Border measures

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Niger](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/147) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Authorities have been conducting increased security checks on foreigners arriving in Niger by air. This may result in your passport being held by authorities for several days when you arrive in Niger.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) vaccination certificate to enter Niger. Some airlines may ask to see it before boarding a flight to or from Niger.

#### Passports

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the West African CFA Franc (XOF).

Only change money at a reputable exchange bureau.

Australian dollars aren't accepted. You can convert US dollars and euros to XOF.

Cash traveller's cheques at commercial banks. You'll need to show the original receipt and your passport.

Be aware that:

* Niger is a cash-based society
* ATMs are not readily available
* credit cards are rarely accepted, even in major hotels and restaurants

Bring enough cash to cover your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Restrictions on travel

Several roads in Niger are closed for travel, except with special authorisation.

Without these authorisations, you could be arrested and deported.

#### Landmines

Unexploded weapons, improvised explosive devices and landmines are a risk throughout the country. Armed groups are known to target convoys travelling on major routes using such weapons.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Niger with a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) and an International Driving Permit (IDP). You must get your IDP before you leave Australia. You must get a local licence if you're staying longer than 3 months.

#### Road travel

Other than a few main routes, most roads are in bad condition or unsealed, including within Niamey.

Dangers include:

* poor vehicle maintenance
* poor street lighting
* hazardous local driving habits

Roads can be dangerous, with traffic including

* bicycles
* pedestrians
* animals
* tractors

Checkpoints are common across Niger, including in Niamey. 

If you travel outside Niamey, you must be escorted by Nigerien security or military forces.

Carry your vehicle registration and ownership papers, as well as necessary permits. Authorities may ask for these at any time, especially outside main towns.

There's no roadside assistance.

Before you drive, check your insurance covers you and learn local traffic laws and practices.

If, despite our advice, you have to travel by road:

* carry sufficient fuel and drinking water for longer than your intended journey
* avoid driving at night
* carry photo ID, vehicle registration and ownership papers
* keep car windows up and doors locked, even when moving
* stay on marked roads
* have multiple forms of communication, mobile coverage can be patchy
* seek professional security advice and arrange appropriate security measures.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger:

* get local advice on road and security conditions before you travel
* leave your travel itinerary with a reliable person
* drive only in daylight hours
* drive in a convoy and with adequate security, including the use of armoured vehicles
* travel in well-maintained vehicles
* carry a satellite phone and first-aid kit

#### Motorcycles

Ensure your travel insurance covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Don't use local taxis. They are generally old and in poor condition. Ride-sharing services are unreliable. Both have poor safety standards and pose a risk of petty crime.

We recommend hiring a private car with a professional driver. Travelling in an armoured vehicle is the safest option.

#### Public transport

Don't use public transport. It is often unsafe due to unqualified and uninsured drivers, poor vehicle maintenance and overcrowding.

Roads are in poor condition, and there's a risk of violent crime or terrorism. Public transport has been targeted by criminal gangs and armed groups in the past.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Niger's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5U) with the Aviation Safety Network.

Dust storms are common during the "Harmattan" season (December to February). Flights can be re-routed when visibility is poor.
