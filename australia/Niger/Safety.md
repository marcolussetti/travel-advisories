#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Political Instability

There's ongoing political instability in Niger following a military takeover in July 2023. An interim military administration is now in place. There's a heightened military presence around government buildings, including the Presidential Palace, and critical infrastructure. The security situation remains highly volatile.

Protests and civil unrest may occur at any time and can turn violent quickly and without warning. Avoid government buildings, demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. Movement restrictions may be implemented by authorities at short notice.

Some land borders remain closed, and others may close without warning. Trying to leave Niger by land borders is likely to be dangerous. Do not travel to several countries neighbouring Niger, including Burkina Faso, Mali, Libya, and Chad. We also advise do not travel to Algeria's, Nigeria's, and Benin's border areas with Niger.

If you can't depart or decide to stay in Niger, limit your movements and avoid protests. Keep a supply of water, food and medicine. Stay in contact with family and friends.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent without warning. Security forces have used force to break up protests. Demonstrations often occur near:

* government buildings
* universities
* public parks

Mobile phone and internet connections may be disrupted during civil unrest. Movement restrictions may be implemented.

Clashes between security forces and armed groups have happened in many regions of Niger. Several have initiated states of emergency in response.

Curfews may be in place in some towns. They can change at short notice.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger:

* avoid political rallies, protests, demonstrations and large gatherings
* if caught up in a protest, leave as soon as it's safe
* monitor international and reliable local media for possible unrest
* obey curfews
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Terrorism

There's a threat of terrorism in Niger, including in the capital, Niamey. Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning in places visited by foreigners.

Many attacks have occurred in recent years, and more attacks are likely. Be aware of your surroundings, be alert to threats and exercise caution, especially around: 

* hospitality venues, including hotels, cafes, restaurants and bars
* locations popular with tourists and foreigners, including national parks
* transport hubs
* religious sites and places of worship
* sporting and cultural events
* shopping centres, supermarkets and markets
* government buildings
* security facilities
* international organisations
* diplomatic buildings
* police stations

If there's a terrorist attack:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* leave the area as soon as it's safe
* avoid large crowds and the affected area in case of secondary attacks

Attacks along any of Niger's borders are also possible.

If you decide to travel to Niger despite our advice:

* get professional security advice
* arrange suitable security measures
* monitor international and reliable local media and other sources for threats
* avoid possible targets
* have an exit plan if you need to visit an area that's a possible target
* stay in accommodation with appropriate security measures in place
* report suspicious activity or items to police
* take official warnings seriously

#### Kidnapping

[Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping is a high threat across Niger, including in the capital Niamey. Various militant groups are active in Niger and neighbouring countries.  

Foreigners are particularly at risk. Terrorist groups and bandits have kidnapped foreign nationals. Kidnappers may execute hostages. Foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted.

Kidnappers may kidnap foreign workers, humanitarian aid workers, tourists and long-term residents from their: 

* homes
* vehicles
* workplaces

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.  

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* review and vary your travel routes and times
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel, and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. 

Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crime is common across Niger, including in Niamey. Crimes include:

* [armed home invasions](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted)
* [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping)
* [carjackings](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged)
* [muggings](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery)

The risk of violent crime increases at night, but it can happen at any time. We advise against walking alone, even in the vicinity of your hotel.

Criminals often work in groups to target foreigners and 4WD vehicles.

Outside central Niamey, the threat of violent crime is higher. 

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing and other petty crimes are common in Niger, including Niamey.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger:

* pay close attention to your personal belongings
* avoid walking in isolated areas or along dark streets at night
* lock your accommodation, even when you're inside
* keep car windows and doors locked, even when moving
* limit any displays of personal wealth.

#### Scams and fraud

Internet [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) come in many forms, including romance, friendship, business and job offers.

Once the online friendship develops, your friend or prospective marriage partner might ask you to send money so they can travel to Australia.

Criminals might also:

* ask to transfer large amounts of money to an overseas bank account and offer you a percentage
* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for fake government contracts
* lure you to Niger for a business opportunity

You could be lured to Africa to meet your friend. Once in Africa, you could become the victim of [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping), [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted), [robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/robbed-mugged), or [extortion](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams). Some victims have been killed. Don't travel to Niger to get your money back or to get revenge. If you suspect a scam, get legal advice.

Some scams ask you to transfer money through the Australian High Commission in Abuja, Nigeria. Some scammers pretend to work there. Check with the High Commission if you're asked to send money or details to them (see '[Local contacts](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/niger#local-contacts)').

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If, despite our advice, you travel to Niger, warn your friends and family about scams relating to your welfare. They may get fake phone calls and emails claiming you're in legal, financial or medical trouble and asking for money to help.

While you're in Niger, be cautious about giving out personal information. Don't throw away personal documents.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

The rainy season is from June to October. Flooding and landslides may occur, blocking roads.

The dry season is from November to May. 

During the dry season, Niger may be affected by the "Harmattan" seasonal wind. This seasonal wind blows a lot of sand and dust in the air. Visibility may be very limited. This wind can cause problems for people with respiratory or optical issues.
