## Overview

### Safety

* Bhutan's crime rate is low. Violent crime is rare, but petty crime, such as burglary, theft, pickpocketing and bag snatching, happens. Look after your belongings. Use licensed tour operators.
* Flooding and landslides can occur. Transport and services can be affected during the monsoon season, from June to September. Earthquakes can happen at any time. Follow the advice of local officials.

### Health

* Altitude sickness is a risk above 2500m. It can be life-threatening. It can affect anyone, even if you're physically fit. Discuss your travel plans with a doctor if you plan to travel to high-altitude areas. Ensure your travel insurance covers medical evacuation from altitude.
* Outbreaks of dengue and malaria occur. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof, use insect repellent, and consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* Hospital and medical facilities are below Australian standards. Facilities outside of Thimphu are limited. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need medical evacuation to another country, such as India or Thailand. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Severe penalties include lengthy jail terms and heavy fines.
* Same-sex activity has been decriminalised. There is no legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Consider limiting public displays of affection.
* Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative, especially at religious sites. Dress modestly. Long pants are best for men and long skirts for women.
