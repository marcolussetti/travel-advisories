# Safety

#### Crime

Bhutan's crime rate is low.

Violent crime is not common.

Incidents of petty crime include:

* burglary
* pickpocketing
* bag snatching

Arrests related to drug and alcohol abuse have increased in recent years.

The [Tourism Council of Bhutan](http://www.tourism.gov.bt/) warns against travellers booking through unregistered tour operators. The council advises that it's not responsible for any complaints about tours booked through unregistered operators.

Only use licensed tour operators.

#### Drink spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

Avoid demonstrations.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners, and where large crowds may gather.

#### Trekking and tours

Trekking can be dangerous.

Plan carefully and use reputable trekking companies with professional guides.

Check your travel insurance covers:

* all activities you plan to do
* emergency evacuation by helicopter or other means

Before you leave, ask your trekking company about:

* the security situation
* weather conditions

Let family and friends know where you will be trekking.

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities, such as:

* trekking
* rafting

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check your tour operator's credentials
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Bhutan experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

[Flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and landslides can occur with little warning. They are more common during the monsoon season (June to September).

If you travel during monsoon season, ask your tour operator if services at your destination have been affected.

Bhutan experiences [earthquakes](/node/345). Seismic activity can occur at any time.

If a natural disaster happens, there are likely to be severe disruptions to transport and damage to essential infrastructure.

Avoid unnecessary travel to affected regions.

To stay safe during a natural disaster or severe weather:

* keep your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and weather reports, as well as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in touch with family and friends
