#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to travel to Bhutan. Visit the [Tourism Council of Bhutan](https://www.tourism.gov.bt/) website for information on applying for visas and the Sustainable Development Fee.

If you plan to stay long-term, you'll need either:

* a work permit
* a volunteer visa or
* another long-term visa

To travel to some areas of Bhutan, you must have permits. Your guide can help you arrange these permits.

Bhutan does not recognise de facto or same-sex relationships. You must provide a marriage certificate to be eligible for a dependent spouse visa. 

Visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

#### Travel via India

If you're travelling to or from Bhutan via India, read our [travel advice for India](/destinations/asia/india "India").

Contact your airline, tour provider, or nearest embassy or consulate of Bhutan to confirm visa and entry requirements.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/our-services/passport-services).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Bhutanese Ngultrum (BTN).

The Indian Rupee (INR) is also legal tender, but larger banknotes may not be accepted.

ATMs are common in towns.

EFTPOS is available nationwide, including at most hotels.

Credit cards aren't widely accepted, but you can use them at major hotels.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

Travellers rarely drive in Bhutan.

Most use organised tours and local drivers.

#### Road travel

Driving can be hazardous due to:

* poor road maintenance
* mountainous conditions
* poor driving standards
* limited lighting

The condition of roads can quickly worsen after heavy rain.

If you plan to drive:

* check your travel insurance policy covers you
* avoid road travel after dark

Allow for delays, especially in heavy rain.
