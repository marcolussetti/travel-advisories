## Overview

### Safety

* An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024 following the resignation of the former Prime Minister. The situation remains volatile, with an ongoing risk of protests and demonstrations across Bangladesh and a heightened risk of civil unrest and disorder. The Bangladesh Armed Forces are deployed nationwide to maintain law and order, and commissioned army, navy and air force officers across Bangladesh have been given authority to act as executive magistrates.
* Large gatherings, including public demonstrations, protests, rallies and strikes (*hartals)*, can turn violent without warning. Avoid protests, demonstrations and rallies and remain aware of your surroundings.
* Random attacks using low-yield improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in Bangladesh. Bangladesh authorities continue to arrest terrorists in the advanced stages of attack planning. We continue to receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks that could occur anywhere, anytime. Be alert at places of worship and during significant national holidays. Monitor the news and other reliable sources for information on such attacks and avoid these locations. Be cautious around locations known to be possible terrorist targets, including public places foreigners are known to visit.
* The Australian High Commission has security measures in place due to the risk of a terrorist attack. Due to safety concerns, Australian officials are not permitted to use public transport (except for rickshaws during daylight hours only).
* Pay close attention to your personal security at all times. Crime has increased, with reports of vandalism, arson and theft. Violence and robberies are common. Thieves target passengers on public transport, including rickshaws, taxis and the three-wheel vehicles known as 'CNGs.' Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and snatch-and-grab incidents, are also common. Keep your car doors locked and windows up and your residential doors, windows and gates locked, even if you have a security guard.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave food or drinks unattended. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Women may experience unwanted attention, including verbal and physical harassment. Assault, including sexual assault, are risks. Avoid travelling alone at night.
* The Bangladesh Government monitors access to refugee camps in the Cox's Bazar district of southern Bangladesh. Crime and violent incidents have occurred in the camps and surrounding areas. Humanitarian assistance should be provided through agencies recognised by the Bangladesh Government. If you are providing humanitarian assistance, follow the security advice provided by your humanitarian agency and local authorities.
* Reconsider your need to travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. Kidnapping and politically motivated violence can occur, and you risk being caught up in clashes between rival groups engaged in conflict.
* There's been increased active conflict in Myanmar, close to the border with Bangladesh. The situation along the border with Myanmar remains unpredictable and could deteriorate at short notice.
* Fires are common in Bangladesh's residential and commercial buildings, shopping centres and markets. Remain aware of your surroundings and exit points.
* The monsoon season is from June to September. The cyclone seasons are from May to June and from October to November. During these times, flooding and landslides can happen with little warning. They can disrupt essential services. Be prepared for major emergencies. Keep an emergency kit on hand.

### Health

* The standard of medical facilities is poor. Medical facilities outside Dhaka are very limited. You'll probably need to pay up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
* Insect-borne diseases occur, including chikungunya, malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Zika virus. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent and take steps to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing clothing covering as much skin as possible. Get vaccinated against diseases prevalent in the region before you travel. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor.
* HIV/AIDS is a risk. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases include cholera, typhoid, nipah virus and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Outbreaks of coetaneous anthrax have occurred in the past and may occur again. Avoid handling raw meat. Only eat fully cooked beef from reliable suppliers.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Severe penalties include mandatory sentences for small amounts and the death penalty. Hookah or smoking pipes are common and may be spiked with illegal drugs. Avoid using them.
* Bangladesh has the death penalty for some serious crimes. Corporal punishment (whipping) is a possible sentence.
* Local authorities can demand to see your ID. Always carry a copy of your passport, even if you're a dual national.
* The Bangladeshi Government may consider you a Bangladeshi citizen if you or your parents are of Bangladeshi origin, even if you've never held a Bangladeshi passport, and were born overseas. It's illegal for Bangladeshi citizens to purchase, carry, possess, transport or consume alcohol without a permit.
* Dress and behaviour standards are conservative. Avoid public displays of affection.
* During Ramadan, Muslims must not eat, drink and smoke between sunrise and sunset. Authorities can detain you if you eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. They may even deport you.

### Travel

* You need a visa to enter Bangladesh. Arrange it before you travel. Visa-on-arrival facilities may be available, but the process can be time-consuming and apply only to specific categories of incoming passengers. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact your local [Bangladesh embassy or high commission](https://canberra.mofa.gov.bd/) for the latest details.
* If you're working, make sure you get either an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate. You'll need to show it when you leave the country.
