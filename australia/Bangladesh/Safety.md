# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Security situation

We advise reconsider your need to travel to Bangladesh due to ongoing civil unrest, demonstrations and terrorism.

An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024 following the resignation of the former Prime Minister. The situation remains volatile, with an ongoing risk of protests and demonstrations across Bangladesh and a heightened risk of civil unrest and disorder.

Crime has increased, with reports of vandalism, arson and theft. Policing has been impacted with significant damage to some police stations across Bangladesh.

Temporary magistracy powers have been given to commissioned Bangladesh army, navy and air force officers. These officers can act as executive magistrates and assist with maintaining law and order across Bangladesh. They have the power to make arrests and place people into custody.  

Avoid large gatherings, including protests, demonstrations and rallies. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent with little or no warning. Be aware of your surroundings, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities. If needed, you should shelter in a safe place and follow the advice of local authorities.

Random attacks with low-yield improvised explosive devices, known as cocktails, happen from time to time in public areas.

International and political developments in the region may cause local protests.

Violence at political events has killed and injured people in recent years. These events included:

* political rallies
* general strikes, also known as hartals
* blockades of rail, road and river transport networks
* high profile criminal trials or sentencing.

Strikes led by political groups can:

* be nationwide or local
* be violent and sometimes lethal
* target public and private transport
* involve both anti-Government protesters and security forces

Blockades of rail, road and river transport networks led by political groups may result in:

* violence that targets public and private transport
* shortages of fuel and other supplies

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid crowded areas and large public gatherings
* be alert to possible threats when political tensions are high
* be alert around significant dates and in areas prone to violence
* make a plan for moving between locations
* have an exit strategy from places you visit
* monitor the media and local sources for information on possible unrest

Crowds commemorating significant dates and anniversaries have also been attacked. Dates of national significance include:

* Mother Language Day on 21 February
* Independence Day on 26 March
* Bengali New Year on 14 April
* Eid-al-Fitr
* Eid-ul-Azha
* National Day of Mourning on 15 August
* Durga Puja in October
* Victory Day on 16 December

There's been increased active conflict in Myanmar, close to the border with Bangladesh. The situation along the border with Myanmar remains unpredictable and could deteriorate at short notice. Follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks are possible in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh authorities continue to arrest terrorists in the advanced stages of attack planning. We continue to receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks that could occur anywhere, anytime. Random attacks using low-yield improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in Bangladesh.

Take official warnings seriously. Monitor the news and other sources for information on any such attacks and avoid these locations. Be cautious around locations known to be possible terrorist targets, including public places foreigners are known to visit.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Australian Government staff in Bangladesh implement security measures because of the threat of terror attack. Security protocols at the Australian High Commission are under constant review.

Australian officials:

* plan and undertake their movements cautiously
* undertake a health and risk assessment for domestic travel
* do not use public transport (with the exception of rickshaws during daylight hours)
* minimise walking alone in Dhaka
* avoid public mass gatherings and other locations that don't have strong security measures in place.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Criminal violence and armed robberies are common and occur in all large cities. In the past, expatriates have been victims of robbery, pickpocketing and 'snatch and grab' attacks.

Thieves, often armed and operating in teams, can target people travelling in rickshaws, taxis and the three-wheel vehicles known in Bangladesh as compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGs). Petty crime, including theft and purse snatching, is common. The risk of robbery increases after dark, especially on public transport.

Law enforcement agencies have increased the number of checkpoints around Dhaka, particularly in Dhaka's expatriate and diplomatic areas of Baridhara and Gulshan.

#### Chittagong Hill Tracts region

Reconsider your need to travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. Politically motivated violence and kidnapping can occur, and you risk being caught up in clashes between rival groups engaged in violent crimes, armed robbery and assault.

If, despite our advice, you travel to the Chittagong Hill Tracts region:

* apply for permission from the [Office of the Deputy Commissioner](http://foreigner.dc-rangamati.gov.bd/home) to visit the Chittagong Hill Tracts
* arrange personal security measures
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

The Bangladesh Government monitors access to refugee camps in the Cox's Bazar district of Southern Bangladesh. Crime and violent incidents have occurred in the camps and surrounding areas. Humanitarian assistance should be provided through agencies recognised by the Bangladesh Government. If you are providing humanitarian assistance, follow the security advice provided by your humanitarian agency and local authorities. 

#### Female travellers

Women may experience unwanted attention and verbal and physical harassment. Assault, including sexual assault, are risks. Avoid travelling alone at night, and take care if you travel in public transportation, rickshaws or compressed natural gas vehicles.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnaps occur in Bangladesh, usually by low-level opportunistic criminals.  
  
There is an increased threat of kidnapping in the Sundarbans Forest region in southwestern Bangladesh and Chittagong Tracts region (including Cox's Bazaar).

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings. Avoid distractions and stay off your phone in the car. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It's important to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile - including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking. Try not to stand out
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night.
* notify family or friends of planned travel; and share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it's best to surrender and cooperate. Resistance tends to make the situation worse

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Fire safety

Fires are common in residential and commercial buildings, shopping centres and markets in Bangladesh due to unplanned urbanisation, lack of fire safety awareness and limited infrastructure and equipment such as fire extinguishers and fire exits. Remain aware of your surroundings and exit points.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Bangladesh experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* [Cyclones](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* Flooding
* [Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [Tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")

Be prepared for a major emergency. Keep an emergency kit.

If a natural disaster happens:

* closely monitor local media and other sources, including the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay in contact with friends and family

#### Cyclones, flooding and severe weather

The monsoon season is from June to September.

The cyclone seasons are from May to June and from October to November.

During these times, [flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and landslides can happen with little warning.

Severe weather can affect services and transport.

The direction and strength of cyclones can change with little warning.

If there's a cyclone or severe storm:

* you may not be able to leave the area
* it could delay or suspend flights
* available flights may fill quickly
* it could affect access to seaports
* there may not be enough shelter for everyone who stays

To reduce your risk of getting caught in severe weather events:

* stay up to date on weather conditions and forecasts
* check cyclone watches and warnings
* monitor local media and regional weather forecasts

If a cyclone is approaching:

* follow the advice of local authorities
* know your accommodation's evacuation plans
* identify your local shelter

If you're travelling during monsoon or cyclone season, ask your tour operator if the weather will affect your services.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Bangladesh also experiences [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") and tsunamis.

The [US Geological Service](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map) website has real-time information on earthquakes.

If there's an earthquake:

* follow the advice of your accommodation provider and local authorities
* monitor local media and warnings from local authorities

Move to higher ground if:

* you're in a coastal or low-lying area
* you feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* you feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* you see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* you hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media and weather services.
