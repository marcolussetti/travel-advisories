# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include mandatory jail sentences and the death penalty. Jail sentences are mandatory even in cases that involve just a small amount of illegal drugs.

Law enforcement agencies looking for illegal drugs raid places where teenagers and young people spend time.

Hookah pipes or smoking pipes are common in some bars and cafes. Criminals may spike them with illegal drugs. Avoid using these pipes.

#### Serious crime

The death penalty can apply for crimes including:

* murder
* rape
* trafficking of children
* abduction
* espionage
* hijacking an aircraft
* narcotics trafficking

Authorities use corporal punishment such as whipping as an alternative to jail.

#### Proof of identity

Local authorities can demand to see identification.

Always carry a copy of your passport with you, even if you're a [dual national](/before-you-go/who-you-are/dual-nationals "Advice for dual nationals").

#### Other laws

Same-sex acts are illegal. Penalties include jail sentences.

Bangladeshi civil law differs from Australian law. This includes family matters such as:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support

If you plan to do anything that involves local laws, including business and family matters:

* seek professional advice
* make sure you know your rights and responsibilities under Bangladeshi law

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The Bangladeshi Government may consider you a Bangladeshi citizen if:

* you're of Bangladeshi origin
* your parents are of Bangladeshi origin

This may be the case even if you've never held a Bangladeshi passport or were born overseas.

This limits the [consular services](/consular-services "Our services") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

It's illegal for Bangladeshi citizens to purchase, carry, possess, transport or consume alcohol without a permit.

These laws apply to dual nationals.

#### Local customs

#### Dress and behaviour standards

Dress and behaviour standards are conservative.

Public displays of affection aren't socially acceptable. They may attract unwanted public attention, including from law enforcement officials.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, ask a local.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Bangladesh. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, Muslims must not eat, drink and smoke between sunrise and sunset. If you're not fasting, authorities can detain you if you eat, drink or smoke in public during this time. They may even deport you. Seek local advice to avoid offence or detention.
