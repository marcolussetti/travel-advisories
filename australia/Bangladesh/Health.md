#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. Options for medical evacuation may be limited. Ensure you discuss your medical coverage with your travel insurer prior to travelling to Bangladesh.

The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Bangladesh. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

Use mosquito repellents and take steps to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing clothing that covers as much skin as possible and using insect repellent.

[Nipah virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus) is usually transmitted through contact with an infected person or through infected animals, such as bats, as well as food and materials contaminated with their saliva or urine. Avoid drinking raw date palm sap, which can contain the saliva of fruit bats.

#### Black henna tattoos

Avoid temporary black henna tattoos. They often contain a dye that can cause serious skin reactions.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is poor. Medical facilities outside Dhaka are very limited.

Doctors and hospitals usually need up-front payment before they will treat you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
