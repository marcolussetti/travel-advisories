#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Bangladesh. Arrange it before you travel. Visa-on-arrival facilities may be available, but the process can be time-consuming, lengthy and apply only to specific categories of incoming passengers. Contact your local [Bangladesh embassy or high commission](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/20) for details.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Bangladesh High Commission](https://canberra.mofa.gov.bd/) in Canberra for details about visas, currency, and customs rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Tax

If you're working in Bangladesh, each time you leave, you need to present either:

* an Income Tax Clearance Certificate
* an Income Tax Exemption Certificate

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

Never hand your passport over to strangers. If hotel staff ask to make a copy of it, make sure they return it straight away.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](/node/451 "Passports in Australia").
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Bangladesh Taka (BDT).

You must declare amounts of more than $US5000 when you enter or exit the country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can use credit cards and ATM facilities in major centres.

Credit card fraud happens. Take care not to expose your PIN. Monitor your bank statements for possible fraud.

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

You need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Bangladesh.

Get an IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Violent protests and demonstrations can occur in Dhaka and other districts. This includes on the main airport road.

These events can cause major traffic delays and disruptions.

Monitor local media. Follow the advice of local authorities.

Driving can be dangerous. Fatalities are common, as are accidents involving pedestrians.

You're more likely to be killed in a car accident in Bangladesh than in Australia.

Dangers include:

* congested roads
* chaotic traffic
* drivers overtaking other vehicles when it's unsafe

Head-on collisions are common.

Risks are higher at night and outside the major cities.

Cars, buses and trucks often drive at high speed either:

* without headlights
* with headlights at full beam

Many rickshaws and compressed natural gas (CNG) operated vehicles are unlit at night and are difficult to see in the dark. Australian officials in Bangladesh are not permitted to use rickshaws at night.

Monsoon floods can damage roads and make them impassable.

Traffic accidents, even minor ones, often attract large crowds of onlookers. This can quickly get out of control and turn violent.

Other issues that can increase accident risks and severity include:

* people sitting on the roofs of buses and trains
* severe overcrowding inside vehicles

If you intend to drive in Bangladesh:

* get to know local traffic laws and practices
* check the news for road closures
* keep your car windows and doors closed and locked at all times
* don't drive at night if possible

If you're involved in an accident, immediately contact police and follow their instructions.

#### Motorcycles

Australian officials in Bangladesh are not permitted to use motorcycles.

Check whether your travel insurance policy covers you when using a motorcycle, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Australian High Commission staff are instructed not to use taxis or ride-sharing service due to safety concerns.

If you must use taxis, use only registered taxis and limousines. Try to book these through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Australian High Commission staff are instructed not to use public transport, with the exception of rickshaws during daylight hours.

Travel by bus may be unsafe due to:

* unqualified and uninsured drivers
* poor vehicle maintenance
* high-speed driving
* overcrowding

Train travel can be unsafe due to:

* broken tracks
* many unauthorised and unmanned crossings

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Only passengers are allowed to enter the main airport passenger terminal at [Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport](https://www.hsia.gov.bd/).
