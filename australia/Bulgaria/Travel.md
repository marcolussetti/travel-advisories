#### Visas

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Bulgaria is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). This allows you to enter without a visa in some cases. Get an entry stamp in your passport from border control when you first enter the Schengen area.

If you're travelling without a visa, ensure your entire visit to the Schengen area, including your stay in Bulgaria, is within the 90-day limit.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Bulgarian Embassy or Consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/33) for details about visas, customs and quarantine rules.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area is expected to start in October 2025. 

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/33) [Bulgaria](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/33) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

Children under 18 years of age, including dual nationals, may only leave Bulgaria:

* if both parents accompany them or
* if they have consent from both parents

A Bulgarian notary must certify any parental consent.

If you're a single parent, ensure your child meets entry and exit rules.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/44).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

#### Currency

The currency of Bulgaria is the Bulgarian Lev (BGN).

If you're travelling between Bulgaria and any non-EU country, you must declare amounts over 10,000 euros or equivalent on both arrival and departure. This applies to all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll need to pay a fine if you don't declare or give incorrect information.

You don't need to declare cash if travelling to or from another EU country.

#### Access to money

Bulgaria is mostly a cash economy, particularly outside of Sofia, although credit and debit card use is increasing.

Exchange money in banks, large hotels or exchange bureaus. Avoid unofficial or street sellers.

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when you cross borders, even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

Check with local authorities and transport providers for the latest information on entry and exit changes and delays.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Bulgaria, you'll need:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP) and,
* your current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

Your travel and vehicle insurance might be void if you don't have an IDP.

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

When hiring a car, keep a copy of the original contract from the car hire company with you. If you're travelling across a land border into Bulgaria with a hire car, the contract should make clear that the vehicle can travel into Bulgaria.

#### Road travel

Major city streets and intercity highways are generally in good condition.

Driving on rural and secondary roads is hazardous due to the following:

* poor maintenance and lighting
* narrow roads
* poor driving standards
* wandering livestock and horse-drawn carts
* rockslides and landslides on roads in the mountains

Police strictly enforce traffic laws and conduct frequent checks. These include radar speed checks.

Depending on the offence, they may collect on-the-spot fines or confiscate your licence.

If you drive in Bulgaria:

* keep your headlights on, even during the day
* use winter tyres from November to March
* carry a fire extinguisher, first aid kit and warning triangle in your vehicle

When travelling on motorways and outer city main roads, you'll get a fine if you don't have a valid digital vignette (a permit form of toll for using the road network in Bulgaria). A vignette can be [purchased online](https://tolltickets.com/en/products/bulgaria/). You don't need to print it. Authorities accept electronic evidence.

Major works are taking place on the Danube Bridge (the Friendship Bridge), which connects Bulgaria with Romania. During the works, road traffic will be limited to a single lane with a traffic light system. If you plan to travel across this bridge into Romania, plan extra time as delays are expected.

#### Motorcycles

Ask your travel insurer whether your policy covers using a motorcycle, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only authorised taxi and limousine services. Try to arrange these through your hotel. Uber is not available in Bulgaria.

Don't hail taxis on the street. Use taxis with meters that display clear rates.

Taxi drivers may overcharge, particularly at airports and train stations.

You can find companies offering metered taxi services inside Sofia Airport.

#### Quad biking

Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Not all travel insurance covers quad biking. Ensure you pay attention to the small print and exclusions on your travel insurance policy.

#### Public transport

Keep your belongings close on public transport, as petty crime happens.

The train system is poor by European standards. There have been several fires on trains.

Accessible public transport is available in Sofia and other large cities. However, it's limited in some parts of Bulgaria.
