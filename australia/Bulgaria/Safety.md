# Safety

#### Crime

Pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Be careful:

* at tourist sites
* in crowded markets
* on shopping streets
* on trams and buses and at major transport hubs

Car theft is common, even at petrol stations. Make sure to lock your car when going inside to pay for petrol. Only some owners get their vehicles back.

Car break-ins are also common, especially when valuables are easily visible. Park in a secure car park wherever possible.

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep your belongings close, particularly in crowded areas
* securely carry an original form of valid photo ID (such as in a protected travel pouch)
* don't take valuables to the beach
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you
* when driving or parking your car, make sure any valuables are out of sight
* There have also been burglaries from hotel rooms and short term rental accommodation. Make sure you lock your room (including windows and balcony doors) and keep valuables locked in a safe.

Violent crime can happen, including:

* bombings
* shootouts
* turf wars between rival gangs

Organised crime groups are active in casinos, nightclubs and the sex industry.

Watch out for drink spiking, especially at popular night spots. Never leave your food or drinks unattended. Don't accept food, drinks, gum, or cigarettes from strangers.

#### Drink Spiking

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Scams and fraud

ATM skimming and credit card fraud are common. Internet fraud also happens.

To protect your credit and ATM cards:

* use ATMs within banks, shops and shopping centres
* check ATMs for skimming devices before using them
* don't use ATMs that look like they've been tampered with
* be aware of any people who approach you at an ATM
* always keep your credit card in sight
* be wary if asked to re-enter your PIN
* be aware of internet scams

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Bulgaria experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), such as:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* avalanches
* landslides
* flooding
* wildfires
* heavy snowfall

Large earthquakes are rare, but earth tremors are common.

Extreme weather can cause landslides and flooding. During the winter months, storms and heavy snowfall are common. Avalanches may happen in mountain regions, including at popular ski resorts, especially when warm temperatures follow a harsh winter.

From June to October, there are regular alerts for [wildfires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"). Large-scale and fast-spreading fires in forests and fields are becoming more frequent. Heat waves and dry conditions contribute to the danger of fire.

Take official warnings seriously. Follow the advice from local authorities.

If there's a natural disaster or severe weather:

* secure your passport in a safe place
* keep in touch with family and friends
* monitor the media, other local sources and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
