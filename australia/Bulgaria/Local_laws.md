#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

It's a legal requirement to have a form of valid photo ID with you at all times.
