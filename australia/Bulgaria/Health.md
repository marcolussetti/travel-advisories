#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

You may need to show proof of travel insurance in Bulgaria at the port of entry.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Bulgaria. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Stray dogs

Stray dogs roam city streets, often in packs. Dogs can be vicious, and attacks are common. Don't approach stray dogs and seek medical advice immediately if bitten.

#### Rabies

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) may be present in wild animals.

If an animal scratches or bites you, seek immediate medical help. If you're going to work with wildlife in Bulgaria, your doctor may recommend getting the rabies vaccine before you travel.

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) is a risk, especially if you travel through forested areas.

Ticks are common in country areas from April to October.

#### Insect bite prevention

 To reduce the risk of getting infected from an insect bite:

* Use insect repellent
* Cover up with light-coloured, long sleeved and loose clothes
* Use mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed
* Avoid peak activity times, dawn and dusk

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are present. 

They include:

* [trichinellosis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/trichinellosis/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/measles)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [west nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus)

To protect yourself from illness:

* in rural areas, drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid wild game food
* practice good hygiene (washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces)
* Get medical help if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Healthcare standards are well below those in Australia. Medical supplies are limited, particularly outside major cities. Staff rarely speak English.

Several private medical clinics and hospitals in Sofia and other major cities are well-equipped and well-staffed. However, treatment can be expensive. You may also need to pay doctors up-front.

Tourists have reported instances of being overcharged in private clinics in tourist resorts. If you plan to use private medical services (including ambulances), agree on a price with the provider before using the service.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
