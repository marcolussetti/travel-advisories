#### Travel insurance

Make sure you have comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") for the whole time you’ll be away. You're likely to need a specialised insurance policy for travel to a 'do not travel' destination. Some Australian insurance policies may not cover you for travel to 'do not travel' destination.

Confirm what activities and care your policy covers, including in terms of health and travel disruptions. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation: the Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

#### Medication

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Sudan. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Current outbreaks

Sudan experiences outbreaks of cholera, acute watery diarrhoea, dengue fever, measles, mpox and polio. 

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever) is widespread in Sudan. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk all year.

Other insect-borne diseases include these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus)
* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)
* [river blindness](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis)
* [African sleeping sickness](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/trypanosomiasis-human-african-(sleeping-sickness))

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

Consider taking medication to prevent malaria.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is common.

Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

If you're exposed to a risk of infection get immediate medical assistance outside Sudan. This includes if you are the victim of a violent crime or [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

#### Other infectious diseases

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. Including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)

* [Rift Valley fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rift-valley-fever)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Due to the conflict several hospitals are out of service, especially in the Khartoum area. Medical facilities are basic in Khartoum and inadequate elsewhere.

You may need to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you.

If you become ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
