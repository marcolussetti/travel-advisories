## Overview

### Safety

* Australians should strongly consider leaving Sudan as soon as possible. There are commercial departure options from Port Sudan or Port Suakin. You may also be able to enter Egypt and other neighbouring countries via land borders. You'll need valid travel documentation and visas. You should confirm the exact requirements with your transport provider. For more information (see '[Safety](#safety)').
* The security situation remains volatile, and violence could escalate with short notice. Carefully consider the risks for any departure route, including during ceasefires. Overland travel is dangerous, including to border areas due to the security situation.
* If you choose to remain in Sudan and are not confident in the safety and reliability of any departure option, you should continue to shelter in a safe place. Assaults, home invasions and looting have occurred. Foreigners have been the target of such attacks, including on-road departures. Remain vigilant at all times, including around large crowds. Adopt appropriate personal security measures.
* A civil war is occurring in Sudan, with Khartoum and Darfur among the worst affected areas. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Law and order and government services have broken down in many parts of Sudan. Water, electricity, telecommunications, and banking services may not be available. Most hospitals are not functioning. Civilians have been killed in airstrikes and artillery bombardment. Residents have been evicted from homes by armed groups, and looting is common.
* There's a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Kidnapping is a serious risk in Sudan, including in Khartoum. Kidnappers often target foreigners. Avoid crowded areas and known targets. Be alert to possible threats.
* Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are a risk. If you travel overland in Sudan, use main roads and paths labelled as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

### Health

* Sudan experiences outbreaks of cholera. Outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea, dengue fever, measles, mpox and polio have also been reported.
* Yellow fever is widespread in Sudan. You may need to show your yellow fever vaccination certificate when entering and leaving Sudan (see '[Travel](#Travel)'). Get vaccinated against yellow fever.
* Other insect-borne diseases include malaria and Zika virus. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions if you're engaging in high-risk activities. If you think you may have been infected, seek immediate medical help outside Sudan.
* Other infectious diseases, including hepatitis, typhoid and polio, are common. Drink only bottled water. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date.
* Medical facilities are basic in Khartoum and inadequate elsewhere. You may need to get medical help outside Sudan.

### Local laws

* Sudan follows Islamic sharia law. Seek legal advice about family law matters, including divorce, custody and child support.
* Serious crimes attract the death penalty. Other crimes are punishable by lashes. Same-sex relations, extra-marital relations, and trying to convert a Muslim to Christianity are all illegal.
* Non-Muslims can consume alcohol, but not in the company of Muslims.
* Be careful when taking photographs. You need a permit for any photography. Even with a permit, it's illegal to photograph certain areas, including military installations, infrastructure and slums.
* Sudan has strict Islamic dress codes. Women should wear a headscarf and loose clothing covering the arms and legs.
