# Safety

#### Security situation

[Armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/621) is occurring across the country. Heavy fighting, gunfire and explosions are ongoing. The security situation remains volatile, and violence could escalate with short notice.

There are reports of assaults, home invasions and looting, including on road departure routes. Foreigners and staff of international organisations have been the target of attacks and assaults, including sexual assault. Further violence could occur, including in places frequented by foreigners. Remain vigilant at all times, including around large crowds.

There are disruptions to critical infrastructure and essential services, including road and bridge closures, electricity and telecommunications outages, restrictions to healthcare services and shortages of medical supplies.

We continue to advise do not travel to Sudan.

If you choose to remain in Sudan or are not confident in the safety and reliability of any departure option, you should:

* adopt appropriate personal security measures
* keep adequate supplies of water, food, fuel, cash and medication
* keep your phone and batteries charged
* take a photo of, and keep your passport and other travel documents with you and up to date
* monitor the media to stay informed on the evolving situation and continue to follow our advice on Smartraveller.

#### Leaving Sudan

Australians should strongly consider leaving Sudan as soon as possible. There are commercial departure options from Port Sudan. You must have valid travel documentation and visas to exit Sudan and enter Saudi Arabia or Egypt. You should confirm the exact requirements with your transport provider.  Khartoum International Airport is not operating.

Overland travel is becoming more dangerous, including to border areas. You should consider the risks for any departure route, including during ceasefires. Any travel options, including convoys, are taken at your own risk. Make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas.

Contact your friends and family as soon as possible to let them know you’re safe. If you have significant concerns for your welfare, or that of another Australian, contact the Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 in Australia or +61 2 62613305 outside Australia.

There are reports of visa [scams](/node/363) impersonating the Department of Home Affairs. A fake visa won’t be recognised in Australia. To protect yourself from visa scams, you should only deal with official Australian Government channels such as the departmental website, reputable travel agents, Australian Visa Application Centres, or the [Australian High Commission or Embassy](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas).

#### **Entry into Saudi Arabia**

If you're travelling from Sudan to Saudi Arabia, you must have valid travel documentation. Provisional travel documents (PTDs) or IMMICards will not be accepted. You are unable to enter Saudi Arabia on an Emergency Passport but may be allowed entry for transit only in some locations (not including Jeddah). You will need to show proof of onward travel on a Saudi airline with a transit of less than 10 hours.

You need a visa for Saudi Arabia. You can obtain a visa online (e-visa) or on arrival.

Read the [Saudi Arabia travel advice](/node/203) for information on entry requirements.

If you've arrived in Saudi Arabia from Sudan and need consular assistance, contact the Australian Embassy on +966 11 2500990 or email [consular.riyadh@dfat.gov.au](mailto:consular.riyadh@dfat.gov.au)

Sudanese passport holders have different visa and entry requirements for Saudi Arabia. If you're a Sudanese passport holder check the visa and entry requirements with the Sudanese and Saudi Arabian Consulate or Embassy or directly with your travel provider. Entry and visa requirements can change without notice.

#### **Entry into Egypt**

Egyptair is currently operating flights between Cairo and Port Sudan. Check with your travel agent. You can enter Egypt by the land border accessed through Wadi Halfa. Transit through the Egyptian border can take several days, with almost no infrastructure and very limited access to food and water. Carefully consider the risks.

If you're travelling from Sudan to Egypt, you must have valid travel documentation. Emergency Passports are accepted in Egypt.

You need a visa to enter Egypt. You can obtain a visa online (e-visa) or on arrival.

Read the [Egypt travel advice](/node/308) for information on entry requirements.

Sudanese passport holders have different visa and entry requirements for Egypt. If you're a Sudanese passport holder check the visa and entry requirements with your travel provider or the relevant authority. Entry and visa requirements can change without notice.

#### **Other land borders**

You may not be able to cross some land borders. Sudan's border with Chad and Eritrea are closed. Do not travel to neighbouring Libya, Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. You should carefully review our [travel advice](/destinations) for any neighbouring country.

Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are a danger, particularly in the Eastern States and Southern Kordofan. Use main roads and paths labelled as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### **Demonstrations and protests**

Large-scale protests and demonstrations can take place in Khartoum and across the country. Demonstrations and protests have occurred in the past. There have been reports of violence against protestors, including arbitrary arrests and deaths. Protests can occur at short notice and turn violent quickly.

Avoid demonstrations and areas of possible unrest. Avoid public spaces in the period surrounding Friday prayers. Remain vigilant and limit your movements.

Internet and phone services continue to experience disruptions and remain unreliable.

Roadblocks and checkpoints continue to be imposed throughout Khartoum and across Sudan. If you encounter a roadblock, remain calm and seek an alternative route. Do not attempt to force your way through it.

Politically motivated protests, including anti-Western rallies, occur in Sudan.

The use of weapons is common. Conflict can escalate rapidly.

Curfews are imposed with little or no warning. Observe curfews and follow the advice of local authorities.

Security forces may continue to:

* ban unauthorised public gatherings
* give security forces increased powers to arrest, restrict movement and seize assets, and
* close border crossings at short notice.

Fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces continues across the country. Violent and ongoing clashes among rebel groups and within the Sudanese Armed Forces have been reported.

Violent skirmishes occur between local communities and armed groups in Abyei.

Violence has resulted in the deaths of thousands and displaced millions of people.

Darfur remains dangerous and is an active conflict zone. The security situation remains volatile.

Civilians, including foreign workers, could be affected by violence directed at others.

#### Terrorism

There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time.

Foreigners have been the target of attacks. Further violence could occur, including in places frequented by foreigners. Remain vigilant at all times.

Terrorist groups have previously stated their intent to harm Westerners through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings.

Targets have included:

* places of worship
* airports and other transportation hubs and networks
* sites frequented by foreigners
* tourist attractions
* hotels, restaurants, bars and coffee shops
* shopping centres and markets

To protect yourself if you travel to Sudan despite the risks:

* vary routes and patterns of movement
* avoid travel at night, including in Khartoum and other urban areas
* avoid crowded areas and other possible targets
* monitor the media for threats, curfews and other restrictions
* take official warnings seriously

If you're travelling outside urban areas, arrange personal security.

If there's an attack, leave as soon as it's safe. Follow the advice of local authorities.

Avoid the area after an attack because of the risk of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

To protect yourself from crime:

* Remain alert to possible threats.
* Take precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.
* Leave valuable items out of sight.
* Keep your doors locked and windows closed at all times.
* If you’re stopped, avoid confrontation.

Foreigners are targeted for robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking elsewhere in Sudan and particularly in Darfur.

Banditry is widespread throughout western Sudan. Particularly in the Darfur and Chad–Sudan border regions, where several incidents have resulted in deaths.

[Sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment") is common in areas of armed conflict.

Due to the high risk of HIV/AIDS infection, if you are a victim of violent crime, especially rape, seek immediate medical assistance outside of Sudan.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. 

[Kidnapping](/node/57) is a serious risk in Sudan, including in Khartoum and Darfur region. Foreigners, humanitarian aid workers and journalists have been kidnapped.

People trafficking groups operate in:

* the south and east of Sudan along the border with Eritrea and Ethiopia
* some northern states

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping: 

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* vary your movements and don’t set patterns
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Sudan can experience [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including:

* high temperatures
* sand and dust storms
* flooding

Recent heavy rainfall has intensified in Sudan, causing flooding, displacement and deaths. Ensure you check local weather reports, avoid flood affected areas and adhere to instructions by local authorities.

The temperature in Sudan can be extremely high. It can reach more than 50˚C.

Sudan experiences regular sand and dust storms.

The rainy season is from July to October. Seasonal flooding can affect overland travel and reduce the provision of essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged.

To protect yourself if severe weather is approaching:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources, such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your friends and family
