#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

We continue to advise do not travel to Sudan. The security situation remains volatile. Overland travel is becoming more dangerous, including to border areas. See ‘[Safety](#safety)’.

#### Visa conditions

If despite our advice you travel to Sudan, you'll need a visa to enter.

Getting a visa can take several months. Visas are not granted automatically.

Visitors on a single-entry visa need to obtain an exit visa to leave the country. However, this is not always enforced. You can get an exit visa at the airport. You should be ready to show proof of your sponsor and pay the exit visa fee. Visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. This includes currency, customs and quarantine.

Contact the [Embassy of Sudan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/187) in Canberra for details.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Sudan. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia [after exposure to yellow fever](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/yellow-fever).

#### Border measures

If your passport has an Israeli visa or Israeli entry/exit stamps you won’t be allowed to enter Sudan. This can happen even if you have a valid Sudanese visa.

Register with the Aliens Registration Office, Ministry of the Interior, within three days of arrival in Sudan if it's safe to do so. Most government ministries are now operating from Port Sudan. Check with local authorities for up-to-date requirements.

Carry photo identification with you at all times.

In 2020, Sudan introduced new laws allowing women to travel with their children outside of the country without the consent of the children's father. However, this law may not be applied consistently, and women and children may encounter difficulties exiting Sudan without the consent of the children's father. 

Airport departure taxes apply.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. It can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than six months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Sudanese Pound (SDG). You can’t convert outside the country and it’s illegal to export it.

Sudan operates on a cash only economy. Credit and debit cards are not accepted, even at large hotels. Make sure you have enough cash with you. Take unmarked US dollars dated from 2006.

ATMs only accept local bank cards. Western Union and other money transfer systems are currently unreliable.

Change money through banks or official exchange bureaus. It’s illegal to exchange currency outside of official banking channels. You could be fined or go to prison.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

We continue to advise do not travel to Sudan. The security situation remains volatile. Overland travel is dangerous, including to border areas. 

You should consider the risks carefully for any departure route, including during ceasefires. Any travel options are taken at your own risk.

You may not be able to cross some land borders. Sudan's border with Chad and Eritrea are closed. Do not travel to neighbouring Libya, Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan. You're responsible for your own safety and that of your family. You should carefully review our [travel advice](/destinations) for any neighbouring country, including [Egypt](/destinations/africa/egypt "Egypt") and [Ethiopia](/destinations/africa/ethiopia "Ethiopia"). 

Prior to the conflict authorities strictly enforced permit regulations for travel outside of Khartoum. Current arrangements are unclear.

If you encounter a roadblock, remain calm and seek an alternative route. Do not attempt to force your way through it.

Road traffic accidents are common. If you use public transport or vehicles for hire such as rickshaws and ‘amjad minivans’, you are at higher risk.

Road conditions are poor and many roads, even major ones, are unsealed or have potholes.

Crowds can gather following accidents and can become violent.

Landmines and unexploded remnants of war are a danger, particularly in the Eastern States and Southern Kordofan. Use main roads and paths labelled as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

#### Driving permit

You’ll need a valid international driving permit (IDP). Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis and limousines. Book these through your hotel.

Take care when travelling alone at night.

#### Public transport

Avoid using public transport as safety and maintenance standards are poor.

#### Boat travel

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") occurs in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

All forms of shipping are attractive to pirates, including:

* commercial vessels
* pleasure craft
* luxury cruise liners

To protect yourself when [travelling by boat](/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel "Travelling by boat"):

* check the [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre) piracy reports
* be alert to threats
* exercise extreme caution

#### Air travel

All Sudanese-registered airlines are banned from operating in European airspace.

There have been hijackings in the past.

DFAT doesn’t provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Sudan's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=ST) with the Aviation Safety Network.
