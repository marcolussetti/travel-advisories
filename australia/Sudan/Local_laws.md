# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe.

Sudan follows Islamic sharia law.

Seek legal advice about family law matters, including divorce, custody and child support.

Be aware of your rights and responsibilities.

#### Serious crime

Serious crime, such as murder, can attract the death penalty.

Some offences attract physical punishment such as lashes.

In Sudan it's illegal to:

* have same-sex relationships
* have extra-marital relations
* try to convert a Muslim to Christianity

Non-Muslims can drink alcohol, but not in the company of Muslims.

You need a permit for photography of any kind.

Even with a permit, you can't photograph:

#### Dual citizenship

Sudan recognises dual nationality.

Local authorities can decide whether they consider you Sudanese or Australian.

In practice, dual Australian-Sudanese nationals are treated as Sudanese.

This limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

#### Local customs

There are strong Islamic codes of dress and behaviour in Sudan.

If you're a woman, wear a headscarf and loose clothing to cover the arms and legs.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Sudan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
