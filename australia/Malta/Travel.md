#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

Malta is a part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"). You can enter Malta without a visa in some circumstances. You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Malta, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:

* as a tourist
* to visit family or friends
* to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
* for short-term studies or training.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [High Commission of Malta](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/124) for details about visas, currency and customs.

Review [entry requirements to the EU and Schengen Area](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), as they can change frequently.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Malta](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/124) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

Malta follows [Schengen area rules](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm#:~:text=Passport%2C%20entry%20and%20visa%20requirements,-If%20you%20are&text=Your%20passport%20should%20be%20valid,within%20the%20last%2010%20years.). Your passport must:

* Have a date of issue less than 10 years before the date you arrive
* Have an expiry date at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

Malta accepts passports with gender 'X'.

#### Money

The official currency of Malta is the Euro.

You need to declare if you are travelling with 10,000 euros or more when entering, transiting or exiting Malta. This applies to all forms of currency.

If you don't declare your money or give incorrect information, you'll be fined.

#### Local travel

#### Hunting season

Hunting with firearms is common in rural Malta.

Hunting areas are rarely marked and can overlap with:

* camping areas
* country walkways
* other public areas

The spring hunting season is in April. The government announces the exact dates in March each year.

The autumn hunting season usually runs from 1 September to 31 January.

During hunting season, hunting is allowed during set times of the day, which can change yearly. However, hunting may occur outside these times and in undesignated locations.

To stay safe if you visit a rural area during a hunting season:

* be alert to the presence of hunters
* seek local advice on how to avoid incidents

#### Road travel

Road travel is hazardous because of poor local driving standards and road conditions.

Locals regularly don't use indicators and often ignore road markings, pedestrian crossings, and stop or giveaway signs.

Roads can be:

* narrow
* congested
* susceptible to flash flooding in heavy rain

Many roads don't have footpaths.

#### Traffic accidents

If you're involved in a minor rear-end collision, and no one is injured, you don't need to contact the police or local wardens.

If you're involved in any other accident, you must contact the local wardens: (+356) 2132 0202.

Don't move your vehicle until wardens have recorded the details of the accident.

If you're involved in a traffic accident that causes injury, you must contact the police at (+356) 2122 4001 or call them on 112.

#### Driving permit

* You don't need an International Driving Permit. You can use your Australian driver's licence to drive in Malta for one year from arrival (digital driver's licences may not be accepted). If you plan to live in Malta for more than one year, you must exchange your Australian licence for a Maltese licence.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer to see whether your policy covers you when riding a motorbike, quad bike, or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

There are several taxi (or equivalent) services in Malta.

Taxis from the airport are regulated and have set prices. White taxis at taxi stands can either be pre-paid at a taxi booth or the driver will use a meter. Taxis are regulated.

Some taxi companies can be booked via an app, which guarantees the upfront cost. There are times when the fares will differ, if the drive takes considerably longer due to heavy traffic or if they have to wait for you. Taxis don't have credit card facilities. However, you can pay either cash or via credit card through the app when booking. Uber, Bolt and eCabs are the primary providers and are quick and cost-effective.

#### Buses

The public bus system that services main cities is generally reliable.

Some routes may be very crowded, and some buses aren't able to pick up passengers at all stops.

Pickpocketing can occur on buses, particularly on popular tourist routes.

All buses in Malta are free if you have the Tallinja card, which can be purchased from various outlets throughout Malta and Gozo. The Tallinja smartphone app provides GPS tracking and information on bus timetables and routes.
