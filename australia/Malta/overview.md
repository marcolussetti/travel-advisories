* Traffic congestion and dust storms from North Africa can cause bad pollution and might lead to breathing problems. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Medical care and health facilities are good in Malta.
* Australia has a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Malta for stays up to 6 months, meaning you can get treated in public medical facilities under Medicare arrangements. You still need travel insurance.
