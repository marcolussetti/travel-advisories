# Safety

#### Crime

Bag-snatching, pickpocketing and other petty crimes occur in Malta.

Crime happens in areas visited by travellers, including:

* nightclubs
* beaches
* markets
* hotels
* rented accommodation

Thieves target people using ATMs. Theft from parked cars and buses can occur.

To stay safe from petty crime:

* pay close attention to your belongings, particularly in crowded areas and on buses
* use ATMs in shops and shopping centres where possible.
* keep luggage and personal possessions out of sight in parked cars

Poor crowd control and excessive drinking in and around nightclubs can lead to violence.

To stay safe in and around nightclubs:

* stay with people you trust in bars and nightclubs
* avoid confrontations
* never accept food or drinks from strangers
* never leave your drink unattended, as drink spiking does occur

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
