# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drug laws

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long jail sentences and heavy fines.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
