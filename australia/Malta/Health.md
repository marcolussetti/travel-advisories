#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. 

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Malta. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Various factors, including traffic congestion, fireworks residue, construction and dust storms from North Africa can cause high pollution levels. This increases the risk of breathing problems. If you have a heart or lung condition, you may be affected.

To protect yourself from air pollution:

* seek medical advice
* follow advice from local authorities about reducing exposure
* check an [air quality index](https://aqicn.org/map/malta/)

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities and care in Malta is generally good but can be expensive.

However, if you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to the United Kingdom or another European country for treatment.

Medical evacuation can be very expensive. 

There are decompression chambers at Mater Dei Hospital and Gozo General Hospital.

Contraceptives are available on prescription.

The morning-after pill is not readily available.

Abortion is illegal in Malta except where a woman's life is at immediate risk, or her health is in grave jeopardy, which can lead to death. 

#### Reciprocal health care agreement

Malta and Australia have a [Reciprocal Health Care Agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reciprocal-health-care-agreements).

The agreement covers you for up to 6 months after arriving in Malta at public facilities.

It gives you access to government medical facilities and care but doesn't provide for ongoing treatment of existing health conditions. The agreement does not cover treatment in private health facilities.

The Reciprocal Health Care Agreement does not replace the need for private travel insurance with good medical coverage.
