#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. Treatment for mental health conditions is not widely available in South Korea and is not comparable to services in Australia. Few hospitals have mental health or psychiatric wards attached, and of those available, many will not accept foreigners.

Admission to a mental health or psychiatric ward usually requires proof of a prior mental health diagnosis. For involuntary admissions, 2 family members present in South Korea will be required to sign consent.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

If you plan to travel with medication, check if it's legal in [South Korea](https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/index.do). Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in Korean pharmacies. Some medications may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance in South Korea, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

Before you travel:

* contact the South Korean [Ministry of Food and Drug Safety](http://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/index.do) or email [narcotics@korea.kr](mailto:narcotics@korea.kr) to check whether your medication is a controlled or illegal substance in South Korea
* Check with the [Korea Customs Service](https://www.customs.go.kr/english/main.do) for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country
* ask your doctor about alternative medicines

You may need to apply for a 'bring in' permit. When applying, provide the generic name of the medication, as the brand name in South Korea may be different in Australia.

It may take authorities more than 2 weeks to process your application.

Take enough medications for your trip.

Ensure you carry your medication in its original packaging and carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

* drink boiled water, filtered water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

Strong winds from Mongolia and China carry yellow dust and other pollutants to the Korean Peninsula, particularly from March to May. High levels of airborne pollution occur during this time. High levels of airborne pollution occur during this time.

The dust can:

* cause eye, nose, mouth and throat irritations
* make breathing and heart problems worse

If you're concerned about the effects of dust, speak to your doctor before leaving Australia.

Get medical advice if you have allergies or respiratory difficulties.

#### Medical facilities

The standard of medical facilities in South Korea is good, but few staff members speak English, and there can be cultural differences in how medical services are delivered.

Medical services can be expensive. Hospitals usually require an up-front deposit or confirmation of insurance before they'll treat you.

You can request ambulance and emergency medical assistance by calling 119. This is a 24/7 service with English interpreters available.
