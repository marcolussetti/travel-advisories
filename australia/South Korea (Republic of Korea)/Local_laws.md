# Local laws

#### Local laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

Under South Korean immigration law, foreign nationals are generally not permitted to take part in domestic political activities when in South Korea.

Penalties for drink driving can be severe, and laws are strictly enforced. Drivers are presumed to be at fault for traffic incidents involving injuries to pedestrians.

Electric kickboard (electric scooter) rentals in South Korea are increasing. You must be 16 years or older to ride an electric scooter, have a driver's licence and wear a helmet. Riders should use bicycle paths where available or, if there are no bicycle paths, car lanes while adhering to road traffic rules. Fines can apply for riding while inebriated, failing to wear helmets, or exceeding passenger limits.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Don't carry or consume illegal drugs.

Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs include:

* long jail sentences
* heavy fines
* deportation

#### Employment

Working in South Korea is illegal if it's not specified in your visa, whether paid or unpaid.

Authorities have fined, detained and deported Australians for breaching their visa conditions.

It's difficult to change your visa type once you're in South Korea.

If you plan to work, arrange a work visa through a [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) before you travel.

Disputes over expected working and living conditions for Australians teaching English in South Korea are common.

Some Australians planning to teach English have faced penalties after they or their employment agent provided false documents to Korean immigration authorities.

If you're employed without the right visa, your options will be limited under Korean law.

If you're considering teaching English in South Korea:

* research your employer and employment agent
* consider getting legal advice before you sign a contract
* make sure your visa application is truthful and accurate

#### Other laws

Serious crimes, such as murder, could attract the death penalty.

It's illegal to take photos of and around:

* military zones, assets or personnel
* official buildings

South Korea has strict anti-corruption laws for public officials. Public officials and their spouses can't accept meals, gifts or other benefits above set limits.

'Public officials' include:

* teachers
* journalists
* employees of government-owned or funded companies

Get legal advice to make sure you don't breach these laws.

If you're involved in a commercial or legal dispute, authorities can stop you from leaving until the dispute is resolved.

Same-sex relationships and homosexuality are not criminalised, but same-sex relationships are not legally recognised. There is no law preventing discrimination, including based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in South Korea.

Social norms and behaviour standards around public displays of affection and sexuality are generally conservative, often more so for LGBTQIA+ people. Public displays of affection may offend. Harassment and violence against LGBTQIA+ people have occurred.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

The South Korean Government recognises dual nationality only in certain circumstances.

It's possible that by applying for Australian Citizenship by Descent or by Conferral, you may lose your Korean citizenship.

There are some differences between the Australian and Korean citizenship requirements. This has caused some difficulties, including for children born in South Korea to South Korean and Australian parents. Expectant parents should make themselves aware of these differences and contact the Australian and South Korean immigration authorities in advance of giving birth.

If you've been arrested or detained and have Korean citizenship, we may only be able to provide limited consular help.

If you were born in South Korea or have Korean citizenship, you will continue to be a Korean citizen unless you:

* formally renounce it; and
* remove your name from the Korean family register

Military service is compulsory for male citizens of South Korea, including dual nationals.

The South Korean Government may require you to undertake military service if you:

* are male; and
* are listed on the Korean family register

This is the case even if you have travelled to South Korea on your Australian passport.

The South Korean Government may not allow you to renounce your Korean nationality or leave the country until you either:

* complete your military service, or
* receive a special exemption from serving

If you're an Australian-South Korean dual national, get advice from a [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) before you travel.

Contact the [Korea Immigration Service](https://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do) for information on Korea’s law on dual citizenship.
