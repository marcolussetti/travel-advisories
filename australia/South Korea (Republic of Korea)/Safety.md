# Safety

#### Regional threats

Armed conflict during the 1950-53 Korean War ended with the signing of the armistice agreement, but South Korea and North Korea remain technically still at war. A demilitarised zone (DMZ) separates the Korean Peninsula roughly in half between the South (Republic of Korea) and North (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

Low-level military clashes between the South Korea and North Korea have occurred, including across the DMZ and along the Northern Limit Line in the sea to the west of the Korean Peninsula. Tensions can increase with little warning.

North Korea regularly takes provocative actions, including conducting ballistic missile launches, sending 'trash balloons', and, sometimes, undertaking nuclear weapons tests or other threatening or belligerent behaviours.

In the event of such threats:

* monitor developments
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

The South Korean government has released a free smartphone '[Emergency Ready](http://eng.safekorea.go.kr/main/selectMainMng.do)' app. The app provides emergency messages in English and has information on local emergency services, including:

* police
* fire
* ambulance
* hospitals
* shelter locations

The app is available for both Apple and Android devices.

#### Public Safety

Parts of Seoul, particularly Itaewon and Hongdae, and on public transport, can become very crowded. In October 2022, more than 150 people were killed in a crowd crush during Halloween festivities in Itaewon. Exercise caution in crowded areas.

#### Civil Emergency Drills

Civil emergency drills and exercises are held regularly throughout the year. These can be held nationally, regionally or locally.

Depending on the drill, sirens may sound, transport may stop, and authorities may ask people to take shelter in subway stations or basements.

Follow the advice of local authorities. The South Korean Government has released a free smartphone 'Emergency Ready' app. The app has information on civil defence drills, including shelters and safety guides.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings. This could be more frequent given the evolving domestic political situation as South Korea enters a period of national election campaigning. Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of traffic or other disruptions. Monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

Public protests, including organised strikes and events that draw large groups of people, are common, but they can sometimes turn violent and cause significant disruptions. Protests can affect public transport and access to other public services. Labour disputes have also caused disruptions to health care services, including at the larger hospitals with international clinics.

Avoid large public gatherings and areas with significant police activity if possible. Exercise caution in crowded areas.

To protect yourself:

* avoid protests and demonstrations, and exercise caution if you're caught up in large gatherings and protests
* monitor local media and other sources for news on possible unrest
* follow the instructions of local authorities

Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of disruptions.

Foreign nationals are generally not permitted to take part in domestic political activities when in South Korea.

#### Crime

For most travellers, South Korea is safe and has a relatively low crime rate. However, petty crime can occur, especially in major cities such as Seoul and Busan.

Sexual assault, drink spiking, and other violent crimes can occur, particularly around bars and nightlife areas, such as Itaewon and Hongdae in Seoul.

To protect yourself from crime:

* keep your belongings close
* don't accept drinks, food, gum or cigarettes from strangers
* don't leave food or drinks unattended
* remain vigilant and take care when walking alone at night
* travel in groups if possible

Local authorities may not always respond adequately or consistently to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you're sexually assaulted, you should report it immediately to the local authorities and the Australian Embassy in Seoul.

In general, sex-related crimes are not punished as harshly in South Korea as in Australia, and the prosecution process can be challenging for victims.

You can report crimes, including sexual assault, to the police by calling 112. This is a 24/7 service with English interpreters available.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Although there is no recent history of terrorism in South Korea, attacks can't be ruled out. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time.

You should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in tourist areas and public areas, including those visited by foreigners and where large crowds may gather. Be alert to possible threats.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

The typhoon season is usually from August to September.

If a typhoon is approaching, stay inside. The direction and strength of typhoons can change with little warning.

Identify your closest local shelter if required and follow the directions of local authorities.

Severe weather may also affect:

* access to ports
* road travel and transport
* essential services, such as water and power

If there's a typhoon or severe storm:

* exercise caution
* stay away from affected areas
* you may get stuck in the area
* flights could be delayed or suspended

Monitor weather forecasts and follow instructions of local authorities.

Check with tour operators before travelling to affected areas.

Contact your airline for the latest flight information.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes can occur on the Korean Peninsula, although less frequently than in surrounding regions such as Japan and China.

Tsunamis are also a risk.

Large earthquakes in surrounding regions can cause destructive tsunamis that may affect the Korean Peninsula. If you're in a coastal region after a major earthquake, move to higher ground immediately.

#### Bushfires

Bushfires, also known as wildfires, can occur in the spring and summer months. Fires can start close to cities and tourist locations with little warning and travel quickly. Fatalities have occurred. 

If you're due to travel to an area that might be affected by wildfires, expect travel disruptions. Avoid affected areas, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.

The air quality during these periods may deteriorate due to heavy smoke. Bushfires are highly dangerous and unpredictable.
