## Overview

### Safety

* Avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings. This could be more frequent given the evolving domestic political situation as South Korea enters a period of national election campaigning. Be prepared to change your travel plans in case of traffic or other disruptions. Monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.
* South Korea and North Korea are technically still at war, and tensions on the Korean Peninsula can increase with little warning. North Korea regularly conducts missile launches and other provocations. Monitor developments. Consider downloading the South Korean Government's 'Emergency Ready' app to receive emergency messages in English.
* Civil emergency drills and exercises are held several times a year. These can be held nationally, regionally or locally.
* Large-scale public gatherings and protests are common, particularly in Seoul. Protests are generally peaceful and heavily policed but can sometimes turn violent. If possible, avoid large public gatherings and areas with significant police activity, and exercise caution in crowded areas. These gatherings can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.
* Organised strikes can also occur. These may affect public services, including access to hospitals and medical care.
* South Korea remains safe for travellers, with a relatively low crime rate. However, petty crimes happen, especially in major cities such as Seoul and Busan. Watch your belongings and exercise normal safety precautions.
* Sexual assault and harassment, drink spiking and other violent crimes occur, particularly around bars and nightlife areas, such as Itaewon and Hongdae. Don't accept food, drink, gum or cigarettes from strangers. Remain vigilant, take care when walking alone at night, and travel in groups if possible.
* The rainy season is from June to August. Typhoons can happen in August and September. Heavy rainfall during summer can cause flooding, landslides, and damage to housing and infrastructure. Identify your local shelter (identified by the word 대피소). Follow the advice of local officials.
* Earthquakes are rare on the Korean Peninsula, but tsunamis caused by earthquakes are a risk. Know the tsunami warning signs and move to high ground straight away. Don't wait for official alerts, warnings or sirens.
* Bushfires, also known as wildfires, can occur in the spring and summer months. Fatalities have occurred. Avoid affected areas, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.

### Health

* High levels of pollution occur, particularly between March and May. During this time, strong winds from Mongolia and China can carry yellow dust and other pollutants to the Korean Peninsula, causing eye, nose, mouth, and throat irritations. Get medical advice if you have heart or breathing problems.
* The standard of medical facilities and health care in South Korea is good, but few staff speak English, and there can be cultural differences in how those services are delivered. You'll probably have to pay upfront. Ensure your travel insurance covers all medical costs.
* South Korea is popular for medical tourism. If you're travelling for a procedure, research and choose your medical service providers carefully. Don’t use discount or uncertified providers. Ensure your travel insurance covers complications from surgery.

### Local laws

* Penalties for drink driving can be severe, and laws are strictly enforced. Drivers are presumed to be at fault for traffic incidents involving injuries to pedestrians.
* Australians in Korea should be aware that under South Korean immigration law, foreign nationals are generally not permitted to take part in domestic political activities.
* Using shared electric kickboards (electric scooters) in South Korea is increasing. A driver's licence is required, and you must wear a helmet while riding. Riding while intoxicated is illegal. Make sure you have adequate health and liability insurance before riding.
* Whether paid or not, working or volunteering in South Korea is illegal if not specified in your visa. If you plan to work, arrange an appropriate work visa through a [South Korea embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) before you travel.
* Disputes over working and living conditions for Australians teaching English in South Korea are common. Research your employer and employment agency. Get legal advice before you sign a contract.
* Be careful when taking photos and videos. It's illegal to photograph military zones, assets, personnel, and official buildings.
* The South Korean Government recognises dual nationality only in certain circumstances. If you're a male Australian-Korean dual national, you may have to do military service before you're permitted to depart. This could happen even if you travel to South Korea on your Australian passport. Get advice through a [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) before travelling.
* Same-sex relationships and homosexuality are not criminalised, but same-sex relationships are not legally recognised. Many of South Korea's conservative and religious groups are opposed to homosexuality.
