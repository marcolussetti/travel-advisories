#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Australian passport holders can visit South Korea as tourists for stays of up to 90 days without applying for a K-ETA (or visa waiver) until 31 December 2025. Previously approved K-ETA applications will remain valid up to the granted expiry date. Visit the official [K-ETA website](https://www.k-eta.go.kr/)for more information. 

Long-term visa holders residing in South Korea must apply for a re-entry permit before leaving South Korea. If you leave South Korea without a re-entry permit, your Alien Registration Card may be cancelled and you'll need to apply for a new long-term visa to enter. If you hold an A1, A2, A3 or F4 visa, you're exempt from requiring a re-entry permit.

To apply for a re-entry permit, visit a local immigration office, including at an airport or seaport. If you intend to apply at an airport immigration office on your way out of South Korea, ensure you allow sufficient time to complete the required formalities.

Further information about re-entry permits and medical examination requirements is available from the [South Korean Ministry of Justice](http://www.moj.go.kr/moj_eng/1782/subview.do?enc=Zm5jdDF8QEB8JTJGYmJzJTJGbW9qX2VuZyUyRjQ5JTJGNTI1MTAxJTJGYXJ0Y2xWaWV3LmRvJTNG).

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Arriving passengers could be screened for high body temperature and as necessary might be subject to further health questions.

Contact the [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) in Australia for more information when planning your travel and to confirm requirements.

#### Other formalities

You'll be fingerprinted when you arrive.

Passengers arriving at South Korean airports from particular countries could be screened for infectious diseases, including:

* [Cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-factsheet-basics.htm)
* [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov))

Extra quarantine checks are in place for flights from high-risk areas.

If you have visited countries designated as 'quarantine inspection required areas' for cholera, polio, plague, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or Avian Influenza Human Infection, you may be required to register on the [Korean Q-code system](https://qcode.kdca.go.kr/qco/index.do?lang=en) before arrival or complete a health questionnaire on arrival in South Korea. Countries listed as 'Quarantine Inspection Required Areas' may change without notice.

Further information on 'Quarantine Inspection Required Areas' is available on the '[Notices](https://qcode.kdca.go.kr/qco/index.do?lang=en)' page. Check with the [South Korean embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/105) for the latest requirements for Australians.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate.](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/australian-embassy-korea-republic-of.aspx)

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Korean Won (KRW).

You can change Australian dollars for KRW at local banks and money changers.

Credit cards are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, shops and taxis, particularly in cities and larger towns.

On arrival, declare all means of [international payment](https://www.customs.go.kr/english/cm/cntnts/cntntsView.do?mi=10800&cntntsId=5500), including KRW notes, cashier's checks, or foreign currency over $US10,000 or equivalent. 

ATMs are available in cities and larger towns, but these might not accept some foreign debit cards.

Be aware of card skimming. See [Safety](#safety).

#### Local travel

#### Driving permit

To drive in South Korea, you'll need either:

* a valid local licence, or
* an International Driver's Permit (IDP) and a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

You need a South Korean driver's licence to drive if you intend to stay in South Korea for 90 days or more.

You will need a certified copy of your Australian licence to apply for a South Korean driver's licence.

When issuing you with a South Korean driver's licence, the local authorities will generally ask to keep your Australian driver's licence. They will return your Australian licence in exchange for your Korean driver's licence before you depart South Korea.

Holders of South Korean driver's licences should be aware that they can be fined for not renewing their licences before the expiry date, even if they do not intend to drive. Foreigners intending to be absent for long periods beyond the expiry date should consider officially surrendering their licences or face fines on return.

#### Road travel

South Korea has a high rate of traffic deaths, especially for pedestrians.  
  
While the South Korean police have been more strictly reinforcing traffic rules in recent years, speeding, running red lights, and other risky behaviours are still common, especially by buses, taxis, and motorcyclists. Penalties for drink driving can be severe.

If you're involved in an accident, whether or not you're at fault, you could face criminal charges. Traffic incidents involving injuries to pedestrians are presumed to be the driver's fault. You may need to pay compensation to the injured person.

The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0.03%. Heavy penalties apply for exceeding the limit. Don't drink and drive.

If you're walking:

* look out for motorcyclists, even on footpaths and pedestrian crossings
* don't expect traffic to stop at pedestrian crossings
* check carefully before stepping onto the road

Before travelling by road, learn local road rules and practices.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike. Most policies won't cover you if you don't follow local laws or wear a helmet.

Always wear a helmet.

There are restrictions on riding motorcycles on highways and other major roads.

#### Taxis

Use only authorised taxis, preferably those arranged through your hotel.

Always insist the driver uses the meter. Most taxis accept credit cards.

Rideshare apps are also available in South Korea.

International taxi services are available and may have English-speaking drivers.

Public transportation (including buses and metropolitan subway networks) in and between major urban areas is good.

Most major transportation systems have signs and make announcements in English.
