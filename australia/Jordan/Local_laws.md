# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include life in jail.

Penalties for possessing even a small amount of drugs include mandatory jail terms.

#### Family and business law

Jordan's family laws are different from Australia's. These include laws about divorce, child custody and child support.

If you're involved in family and business issues, get professional legal advice. Know your rights and responsibilities under local laws.

If you want to [get married](/before-you-go/activities/marriage "Getting married overseas") in Jordan, check the legal requirements before you travel. Contact the [Jordanian Embassy in Canberra](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/100) for advice.

#### Criminal law

If you commit a crime, punishments can be harsh by Australian standards. For certain crimes, authorities can sentence you to death though there is currently a moratorium on the death penalty in place in Jordan. These include terrorism, murder, treason and rape of a minor.

You may face hard labour for some offences, such as causing personal injury or property damage.

Authorities may detain you if you do any of the following:

* have consensual sex outside of marriage, particularly with Jordanian nationals, even if in a de-facto relationship or civil union recognised in Australia
* take photos of embassies, military or security sites
* injure a pedestrian while driving a car
* take part in missionary work, preaching or other religious activities that are against local rules
* procure or traffic prohibited drugs

Research local laws before you travel.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

If you're a dual national, you'll be considered Jordanian by law while in Jordan.

The government has stopped compulsory military service. However, all males aged 18 to 40, including dual nationals, still need to register for military service. You need to then postpone your service each year.

If you're eligible and don't register, authorities may stop you from leaving Jordan.

The Islamic fasting month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Jordan. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

It's illegal to eat, drink and smoke in public during daylight hours in Ramadan. If you're not fasting, avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of people who are.

Explore our [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

These activities are not socially acceptable and may offend:

* public affection between couples

Other cultural and social rules can vary between regions of Jordan. Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.
