#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to visit Jordan.

If you're a tourist, the E-Visa program enables you to apply for a digital visa before arrival. Multiple visa options are available on the [Ministry of Interior webpage](https://moi.gov.jo/EN/Pages/Visa_E_Applications), depending on the purpose of your travel.

You can get a single-entry visa valid for 30 days when you arrive at airports. These visas are also available at the border crossings between Jordan and Israel.

You may wish to purchase a Jordan Pass before arrival. More details are available [here](https://jordanpass.jo/).

You need to arrange a visa in advance if:

* you plan to stay for more than 30 days
* you're going to Jordan to do something other than be a tourist, such as work or study

#### Border measures

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy of Jordan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/100) for details about visas, currency, customs, entry and quarantine rules.

Jordan’s international airports are open to commercial flights. Land and sea crossings are also open.

Monitor government announcements and media sources and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Border with Israel

**Border with Israel**

Some land border crossings from Israel into Jordan (Sheikh Hussein, Allenby Bridge, and Aqaba) are scheduled to be opened daily, but crossings may close without notice and for an unknown period of time. You need a visa to enter Jordan. Visas on arrival are available, but be prepared for delays when crossing into Jordan. If you're departing Israel to Jordan, check [Jordanian Border Crossings](https://www.accesscoordination.org/CrossingJordanC19%20-%20view.aspx) for regular opening times and also check the latest public information from local authorities in both Israel and Jordan to determine if border crossings are open before travel.

For details about travel to the West Bank, read the travel advice for [Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories).

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

#### Other formalities

You must comply with additional rules for travellers if you stay more than one month. You must register with the police. You may also need to have medical and HIV tests.

Under Jordanian law, a husband can prevent his wife and children from leaving Jordan. This is the case even if they're Australian citizens. See [Local laws](#local-laws).

You need to pay an exit tax at all border crossings except airports.

In March 2017, the UK government announced [restrictions on carrying electronic devices](https://www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions/electronic-devices-and-electrical-items) from or through Jordan to the UK.

Some countries in the region may refuse you entry if you've been to Israel. Authorities may stop you from entering if you have entry and exit stamps from border crossings. They may also stop you if your luggage has baggage tags showing you've been to Israel.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Jordan if you've travelled through or from an area with a risk or transmission. Some airlines may want to see the certificate when you leave.

Find out about returning to Australia after [exposure to yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

If you travel with an emergency passport, you may be allowed to transit through Jordan. You must confirm this with your airline or your closest [Embassy of Jordan](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/100). Entry into Jordan with an emergency passport will require the approval of the Jordanian authorities. The Australian Embassy is unable to assist with such approvals.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Jordanian Dinar (JOD). Declare all amounts over JOD10,000 or equivalent on arrival. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

ATMs are available throughout Amman and in other major cities. It's harder to find ATMs in rural areas. Most petrol stations on major roads offer ATMs.

#### Local travel

There's a danger of unexploded ordnance, including landmines, along Jordan's borders. Known minefields are usually fenced and marked. These warnings may not be obvious.

Reconsider travel to areas near the borders with Syria and Iraq due to the unstable security situation.

Seek local advice if travelling near Jordan's borders. See more information in 'Land borders' above.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Jordan you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Road accidents are common.

Roads are dangerous at night. In rural areas, stray livestock and unlit vehicles are common.

Incidents of road rage are also common. They can escalate quickly.

Road travel in remote desert areas is very risky. Isolation, distance from towns and lack of phone service can make it difficult to obtain assistance. Even routine vehicle breakdowns can be dangerous.

By law:

* vehicles must carry an extinguisher and a warning triangle
* drivers involved in a motor vehicle accident, no matter how minor, must remain at the scene until traffic police have attended

Call police on 911. You can ask for an English-speaking operator.

If you intend to drive in Jordan:

* learn the local road rules
* make sure your vehicle has all required safety equipment
* avoid driving outside cities after dark
* keep your doors locked when driving
* carry identification documents to show at checkpoints
* stay calm, particularly if faced with 'road rage'
* stay at the scene of an accident unless people threaten your safety

If you travel in remote desert areas, take enough food and water in case your vehicle breaks down. Crime has been known to occur in isolated areas; be careful when speaking to others.

#### Motorcycles

Avoid using motorbikes. It's dangerous due to poor driving and road standards.

Check with your travel insurer if you're covered to ride a motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only licensed taxis or reputable ride-sharing or limousine services. Arrange these through your hotel.

Avoid taxis that tout for business outside airports, hotels and tourist attractions. They often try to charge high prices. Always insist drivers use the meter.

Authorities report taxi drivers have seriously assaulted lone female passengers. If you're a woman, always sit in the back.

#### Public transport

Buses can be crowded. It's worse on holidays and during peak times. Safety standards are not the same as in Australia.

#### Sea travel

International cruise ships visit the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea.

#### Air travel

Flights to and from Jordan may fly over Syria, where ongoing conflict could increase risks to civil aviation. Civil aviation authorities in a number of countries do not allow airlines from those countries to fly in Syrian airspace.  For more information, see[air travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/air-travel) and check with airlines before booking. Flight paths are subject to change. Check with your airline or travel agent for updates and flight options. 

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
