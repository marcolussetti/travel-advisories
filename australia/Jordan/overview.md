# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise exercise a high degree of caution in Jordan. Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions. The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable and could deteriorate further with little warning. There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region, as well as the potential for terrorist attacks. Australians in Jordan should read our general advice about terrorism risks and protecting your safety during an armed conflict (see ‘Safety’).  
  
Missile and drone attacks originating from Yemen and targeting Israel may fail in flight over Jordan leading to falling debris. We recommend remaining indoors and avoiding contact with debris in the event of intercepts. Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of authorities (see 'Safety').  
  
Terrorism is a worldwide threat and could occur anywhere and at any time. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities (see 'Terrorism').

## Overview

### Safety

* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions. The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable and could deteriorate further with little warning. There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region, as well as the potential for terrorist attacks.
* Australians should read our general advice about [terrorism risks](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fsafety%2Fterrorism&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C16c8c58f64de46df6caa08ddb1e93e18%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638862337525088846%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5u8W%2FTVyGCdsRRl%2BmayaLkV%2FmR20Ls1LkH0pckMjk2w%3D&reserved=0) and protecting your safety during an [armed conflict](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fstaying-safe%2Farmed-conflict&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C16c8c58f64de46df6caa08ddb1e93e18%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638862337525123454%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xb7cAVOyMbxADT4V5Ll%2BRFOpW3qDG7nKTx0EB5CCHME%3D&reserved=0).
* Missile and drone attacks originating from Yemen and targeting Israel may fail in flight over Jordan leading to falling debris.  We recommend remaining indoors and avoiding contact with debris in the event of intercepts.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds gather. Take official warnings seriously. If there's a security incident, follow the advice of local authorities.
* Security is unstable in [Syria](/destinations/middle-east/syria "Syria") and [Iraq](/destinations/middle-east/iraq "Iraq"). Land border crossings could close without notice. Reconsider your need to travel to Jordan's borders with Iraq and Syria, which can be subject to cross-border criminal and politically motivated attacks on security forces and military installations inside Jordan.
* Petty crime includes robbery with violence, bag snatching, theft from hotels and vehicles, and assault. Be alert in tourist areas, especially to pickpocketing, bag snatching and assault by unlicensed guides. Scammers operate in tourist areas. They often target single women. They promise companionship, marriage or offer joint business ideas. Credit card fraud, including card skimming, occurs. Be wary of approaches from friendly strangers. Always keep your card in sight when shopping. Check ATMs for card-skimming devices.
* Women may be verbally, sexually and physically harassed or sexually assaulted. Don't make eye contact with or talk to men you don't know. Don't walk or travel alone, especially after dark. Always ride in the back seat of rideshares or taxis.
* Shooting guns to celebrate is illegal but common. It sometimes causes death and injury. Stay indoors and away from windows if people are celebrating with gunfire.
* Flash flooding occurs across Jordan during the rainy season, which runs from November to March. Valleys (wadis) are most at risk, but recent flooding has closed roads, including major highways. Monitor weather conditions before commencing road travel. Follow the advice of local authorities and avoid flood waters.

### Health

* There are reports of cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ([MERS-CoV](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov))). Avoid consuming products contaminated with camel secretions. Wash hands regularly before and after touching animals.
* Waterborne, foodborne, insect-borne and other infectious diseases are prevalent. They include hepatitis, typhoid, measles and sandfly fever. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked foods. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* Amman has high-quality private medical services. Outside major cities, health services are basic. Paramedic and ambulance services are basic compared with Australia. You may have to pay up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you might need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Many laws in Jordan differ from laws in Australia, including sex outside marriage, photos of embassies, military or security sites and religious activities. Familiarise yourself before you go. Get professional advice for local legal matters. You may be prevented from leaving the country until issues are resolved.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs – items containing CBD oil are illegal in Jordan. Penalties for drug offences include life imprisonment. You may face jail terms for possessing small amounts of drugs. Serious crimes attract the death penalty. These include terrorism, murder, treason and rape of a minor. Some offences, such as causing personal injury or property damage, are punishable by hard labour.
* Drones are not allowed to be brought into Jordan without prior approval from the Jordanian authorities. Unapproved items will be confiscated and held at the airport. The authorities will provide advice on the collection process.
* Respect the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, it's illegal to eat, drink and smoke in public during daylight hours.
* Local customs are conservative. Public affection between couples is unacceptable, as are unmarried couples living together or sharing accommodation. Same-sex relations are not socially acceptable. Always get consent before taking photos of people.
* If you're a dual national, authorities will consider you Jordanian. Men aged between 18 and 40 need to register for military service, although you don't have to complete it. If you don't register, authorities may not let you leave the country.

### Travel

* You'll need a visa to visit Jordan. Multiple visa options are available on the [Ministry of Interior webpage](https://moi.gov.jo/EN/Pages/Visa_E_Applications), depending on your travel requirements. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.
* Some land border crossings from Israel into Jordan are scheduled to be opened daily, but crossings may close without notice and for an unknown period of time. You need a visa to enter Jordan. Visas on arrival are available but be prepared for delays when crossing into Jordan. If you're departing Israel to Jordan, check the latest public information from local authorities in both Jordan and Israel to determine if border crossings are open before travel. Be prepared for delays when crossing into Jordan.
* Australians who were previously in Jordan under a refugee status determination, should check with the Jordanian [Public Security Directorate](https://psd.gov.jo/en-us) on whether they can legally re-enter Jordan.
* There are unexploded weapons and landmines in Jordan's border regions. Known minefields are usually fenced and marked, but warnings may not be obvious. Get local advice in these areas.
* Road rage incidents are common. They can escalate quickly. Road travel in remote desert areas is very risky. Don't drive outside cities at night. If you're in an accident, no matter how minor, stay at the scene until traffic police arrive.
* Flights to and from Jordan may fly over Syria, where ongoing conflict may increase risks to civil aviation. Civil aviation authorities in a number of countries do not allow airlines from those countries to fly in Syrian airspace.  Check with your airline or travel agent for updates and flight options.
