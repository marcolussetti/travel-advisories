#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Border with Israel

Some land border crossings from Israel into Jordan are scheduled to be opened daily, but crossings may close without notice and for an unknown period of time. You need a visa to enter Jordan. Visas on arrival are available, but be prepared for delays when crossing into Jordan. If you're departing Israel to Jordan, check the Jordanian and [Israeli government websites](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/emergency-information-border-crossing) to determine if border crossings are open before travel.

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations and protests are common, including in Amman.

They're triggered by:

* domestic and regional events
* economic issues
* important anniversaries

Most have been peaceful. However, public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Demonstrations often occur after Friday noon prayers but can happen at any time. These often result in road closures.

They're likely to occur:

* near large mosques, government ministries and diplomatic missions
* at major intersections
* in downtown areas of Amman

Demonstrations and protests also occur in regional centres, including:

* Irbid
* Zarqa
* Mafraq
* Madaba
* Karak
* Tafileh
* Ma'an
* Ajloun
* Salt

They can also happen on the major highways between these towns.

To stay safe:

* avoid all demonstrations, protests and large public gatherings
* check the media for news of possible unrest
* avoid possible unrest on national days or commemorations
* change your plans if there are disruptions
* follow the advice of local authorities

Contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help if there are disruptions.

#### Border regions

Security is unstable in [Syria](/destinations/middle-east/syria "Syria") and [Iraq](/destinations/middle-east/iraq "Iraq"). Land border crossings could close without notice.

There's frequent military activity near Jordan's borders with these countries. This includes shelling, gunfire and drone attacks from smugglers and militias in Syria and Iraq.

People have died or been injured on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. Jordan has deployed extra security forces to the area.

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather. Jordanian authorities have stopped terrorist plots in recent years.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

Foreigners living in Jordan have been targeted at:

* embassies
* expatriate housing areas and schools
* outdoor events

To stay safe:

* be aware while in places known to be possible targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

People have reported:

* [robbery with violence](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* bag snatching
* burglaries
* assaults against foreigners in tourist areas, including assaults by unlicensed guides
* bags stolen from hotels and vehicles
* aggressive begging practices by organised criminal groups

Be alert to pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially in tourist areas.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Scams and fraud

Scammers work in tourist areas. They often target single women. They promise companionship or marriage.

Some scammers offer joint business ideas. Their aim is to take large sums of money from their target. Jordanian laws can make legal action difficult. Scams involving sex outside of marriage may not be investigated by local authorities due to local laws and cultural differences. See [Local laws](#local-laws).

Authorities report credit card fraud. This includes the use of card-skimming machines.

To avoid being scammed:

* keep your credit card in sight during transactions
* check for card-skimming devices before you use an ATM
* be wary of friendly strangers, especially if the person mentions marriage or business ventures

#### Firearms

Firearms are more common than in Australia. Criminals sometimes use firearms. Shooting guns to celebrate is illegal but still occurs. It sometimes causes death and injury.

Stay indoors and away from windows if people are celebrating with gunfire.

#### Female travellers

Women are often subject to harassment. This includes leering, unwanted physical contact and stalking.

Incidents of sexual assault against foreign women are reported. Friendliness can be misinterpreted.

If you're a woman:

* avoid eye contact and talking to men you don't know
* avoid walking or travelling alone, particularly after dark or in lonely places
* always ride in the back seat of rideshares or taxis, especially when travelling alone
* pay attention to your surroundings, and leave if you feel uncomfortable
* report sexual assault incidents to the police

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Tours and safety

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes adventure activities.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

#### Climate and natural disasters

Jordan is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") area.

Rock falls and landslides can occur, especially in valleys.

There can be sand or dust storms, especially in desert areas. Snowstorms can happen at higher elevations, including in Amman.

The rainy season runs from November to March and can cause flash [flood](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")[ing](https://www.who.int/health-topics/floods). Valleys (wadis) are most at risk. Recent flooding has closed roads, including major highways. Monitor weather conditions before commencing road travel. Follow the advice of local authorities and avoid flood waters.

* In December 2022, an estimated 1,700 tourists were evacuated due to flash floods in Petra
* In October 2018, 21 people died in flash floods around the Dead Sea

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/before-you-go/safety/severe-weather "Severe weather") happens:

* keep your passport in a safe place
* closely monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay in contact with friends and family
