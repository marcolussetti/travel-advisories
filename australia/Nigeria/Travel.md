#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You'll need a valid visa or Nigerian residence permit to travel to or reside in Nigeria. You can check visa conditions and apply and pay for a visa online through the [Nigeria Immigration Service](https://portal.immigration.gov.ng/pages/welcome) website. To complete the process, you may need to provide your passport by mail or in person to the appropriate Nigerian diplomatic mission in your country.

Significant penalties, including fines and detention, may apply for people who overstay their visa terms.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the[nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/148) of Nigeria for details about visas, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Border measures

Expect enhanced security and health screening measures at airports. You may also need to fill in a [Health Declaration Form](https://healthapp.ncdc.gov.ng/) prior to arrival.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Nigeria. Some airlines may require sighting your vaccination certificate prior to boarding your flight to Nigeria.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Nigeria Naira (NGN). 

Nigeria is still largely a cash-based economy. Cash shortages have occurred in the past.

You must declare amounts of currencies, negotiable instruments, or precious stones/metals in excess of US$10,000 or its equivalent brought into or out of Nigeria.

Facilities for changing traveller's cheques and Australian dollars are very limited.

US dollars, British Pounds and Euros are easily exchangeable in Nigeria, and usually accepted at:

* major hotels
* banks
* foreign exchange services.

ATMs are widely available in major cities only. However, non-Nigerian debit and credit cards are rarely accepted outside of major hotels. Most transactions need to be conducted using local cards, bank transfers or cash.

Fraud and skimming are high risks when using debit and credit cards with ATMs or EFTPOS machines. Pay careful attention when using these or when others are handling your cards. Report any unauthorised transactions to your bank immediately.

#### Local travel

Travel services in Nigeria are not reliable. Not all travel providers accept credit or debit cards. You should reconsider your need to travel and have back-up options. 

#### Land borders

Avoid travelling over land borders to and from Nigeria. Nigeria's land borders may open and close at short notice. Check with local authorities if the specific border you propose to travel through is open at the time of travel. Most destinations bordering Nigeria also have a high travel advice level. If despite our advice you travel overland, read the travel advice of the [destination](/destinations) you're entering or exiting.

#### Driving permit

International Driving Permits are recognised in Nigeria for up to three months, provided they are accompanied by a valid driver's licence.

After this period, you must obtain a local driver's licence.

#### Road travel

Driving in Nigeria is dangerous due to:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* poor local driving habits
* unpredictable pedestrians, including street vendors and beggars
* poor signage
* lack of working traffic lights
* poor road lighting
* high number of carjackings

Be alert to security threats, particularly in traffic jams and at traffic lights. Keep your doors locked and windows up at all times.

Avoid travel by domestic road transport between urban centres due to the high incidence of attacks on motorists by criminal gangs, bandits and terrorists. They may attempt to stop travellers with nails and branches on the road, fake breakdowns and injured people, and fake checkpoints. If despite our advice, you decide to travel via domestic road transport, you should engage professional security for support and planning. Travelling in an armoured vehicle with a trusted security provider is the safest domestic road transport option.

Expect delays when you travel. This can include:

* authorised and unauthorised police and military roadblocks
* checkpoints
* traffic diversions
* parking restrictions
* fuel shortages and queues

These will often happen in major cities and after dark.

If you can't produce your identity documents, car registration or ownership papers, police may fine you or ask for a bribe.

If you're in a traffic accident, nearby crowds may gather quickly. They may also overreact if they think you're at fault or use this as an opportunity to assault you or steal from you.

Rental cars may be available but should be avoided as their maintenance record and insurance coverage cannot be assured.

#### Motorcycles

Motorbikes are banned in some cities – for example in Lagos. Check with your travel insurer if your policy includes coverage for riding a motorcycle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis and public transport

We recommend using car hire services that include a driver, organised through a major hotel or reputable security provider. Don’t use local taxis and ride-sharing services, including motorcycle and tricycle (Tuk-Tuk style) taxis called ‘Okada’ and ‘Keke’ respectively, due to poor safety standards and the risk of petty crime. Don't use public transport including bus and rail services, to travel within or between cities. 

Public transport is often unsafe, due to:

* unqualified and uninsured drivers
* poor vehicle maintenance
* high speed driving
* overcrowding
* being targeted by criminal gangs, bandits and terrorists

Travelling in an armoured motor vehicle with professional security support is the safest option.

#### Sea travel

At sea or on ships in port, you may encounter:

* [piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy")
* hijacking
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* armed robbery

Do not travel in the Gulf of Guinea or coastal areas around the Niger Delta. Criminals with speedboats and high-calibre weapons commonly target pleasure craft, cruise liners, oil tankers, container ships and other large vessels in these areas.

The Nigerian Navy has limited capacity to respond to piracy incidents. The International Maritime Bureau issues [piracy reports](https://icc-ccs.org/imb/).

Safety and reliability of some domestic and inter-country ferry services is a concern. Maintenance procedures and safety standards are not to Australian standards. If you travel on these services, insurance may not cover you.

#### Air travel

Domestic and international flights are often overbooked, delayed or cancelled with little notice.

Safety and reliability of domestic airlines cannot be guaranteed. Airlines may not have strict maintenance procedures and safety standards. If you travel on certain airlines, you may not be covered by insurance. Check with your insurance provider before booking flights.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Nigeria's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=5N) with the Aviation Safety Network.
