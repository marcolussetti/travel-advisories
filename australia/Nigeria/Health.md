#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

Travel insurance may not cover you for travel to 'do not travel' locations in Nigeria. Confirm this with your insurance provider.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Nigeria. Take enough legal medication for your trip. Don't assume the same medication will be available in Nigeria if your supply runs out. The quality of medication in Nigeria can't be guaranteed and local pharmacies may not accept Australian prescriptions.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is common in Nigeria.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that may expose you to the virus.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](http://www.health.gov.au/yellowfever) is common in Nigeria. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination, which is a requirement for entry into Nigeria. You must provide proof of vaccination in the form of a 'yellow book'. Get vaccinated before you leave.

Other common insect-borne diseases include:

* [malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria)
* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothes
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

[Lassa fever](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/) occurs in several states in Nigeria. Monitor local media and the World Health Organization for updates.

Lassa fever is spread through contact with rodents or bodily fluids of infected people. To protect yourself:

* avoid contact with rodents and their droppings
* keep food in clean, rodent-proof containers
* don't eat any food if it could be contaminated
* avoid contact with the blood and body fluids of infected people
* avoid contact with items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids (clothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment).

There have been outbreaks of [Mpox](https://www.cdc.gov.au/topics/mpox-monkeypox) (formerly known as monkeypox) in parts of Africa, including in Nigeria. Maintain strict hygiene standards and avoid physical contact with infected people, animals (especially primates and rodents) and items that may have come into contact with them.

Serious outbreaks occur from time to time.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food or food that may have been washed in untreated water, including salads
* don't swim in fresh water.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities throughout Nigeria can be basic.

You may need to pay cash up-front before doctors, ambulances and hospitals will treat you, even in an emergency.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need evacuation to a place with better facilities.

Make sure you get travel insurance that covers hospital stays and medical evacuation, as these can be very expensive.
