# Local contacts

#### Emergencies

Depending on what you need, in the first instance it may be best to contact your:

* family and friends
* travel agent
* insurance provider
* employer
* airline
* hotel

National emergency numbers, 119 and 112, can be unreliable.

#### Fire and rescue services

Call 119 or 112.

#### Medical emergencies

Call 119, 112 or go to the nearest hospital.

There is no national ambulance service. Some hospitals own and operate their own services. Ambulance service response times are unreliable and may not be available outside of major cities.

#### Police

Call 119, 112 or go to the nearest police station.

Police can be slow to respond to reports of criminal activity. Sometimes they may not investigate your report. Sometimes they don't respond at all.

Always try to get a police report when you report a crime.

Your insurer should have a 24-hour emergency number.

#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia has a High Commission in Abuja. However, it may be limited in terms of the consular and passport services it can provide.

Australia has an Honorary Consulate in Lagos. It provides limited consular assistance and doesn’t issue Australian passports. You should first contact the High Commission in Abuja for consular enquiries.
