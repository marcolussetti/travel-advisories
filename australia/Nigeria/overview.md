## Overview

### Safety

* There's a high risk of terrorist attacks across Nigeria by various militant groups. Attacks could be indiscriminate or may target foreign interests. Potential targets include places where crowds gather, such as hotels, bars, restaurants, political meetings, government buildings, places of worship, schools, markets, shopping malls, sporting events, transport hubs and networks, law enforcement facilities, international organisations and camps for displaced people.
* There have been protests and strikes over the cost of living, and these could reoccur anytime without warning. Avoid all demonstrations, strikes, rallies and gatherings. These can turn violent and have sometimes been met with forceful suppression by security forces, including the use of live fire. Trading and business disruptions have occurred. Maintain stocks of essential supplies.
* The kidnapping threat is high throughout Nigeria.
* There's a high rate of crime in Nigeria, including violent crime. The homicide rate is very high in many parts of the country. Follow the instructions of local authorities.
* You should organise professional security advice and support before you depart to Nigeria.
* Avoid intercity transport by road and rail due to the high incidence of criminal and terrorist attacks. If you plan to travel within Nigeria, get professional security advice and support before departing. Australian officials always use enhanced security measures when they travel. Keep your car doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight. Arrange airport transfers with someone you know or book a hotel car. Don't use ridesharing services, taxis, or public transport. Don't travel after dark.
* Internet romance, friendship and employment scams originate from Nigeria. If you travel to Nigeria as a scam victim, you may expose yourself to the threat of physical harm or theft. Be wary of online contact from people you don't know. Don't send money until you've checked who you're sending it to.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

### Health

* Yellow fever is present. Other common insect-borne diseases include malaria and dengue. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication. Check your vaccinations are up to date before you travel.
* Foodborne, waterborne and infectious diseases found in Nigeria include cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, diphtheria, Lassa fever and Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox). Make sure food and drink utensils and containers are clean before use. Drink only bottled water and avoid raw or undercooked food. Don't swim in fresh water due to the risk of bilharzia in some locations.
* Medical facilities throughout Nigeria are often basic. You may need to pay up-front. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences include long prison sentences and large fines. Serious crimes, such as murder and armed robbery, can attract the death penalty, especially in Nigeria’s northern Sharia law states.
* Nigeria has strict laws against same-sex relationships. Avoid public displays of affection and cross-dressing. In Sharia law states, there are harsh punishments for same-sex relationships, adultery or public expression deemed blasphemous or religiously disrespectful.
* Avoid taking photographs of military or police locations or personnel, or in airports. Smoking in public places is prohibited according to law.
* Make yourself aware of Nigerian restrictions on the import or export of foreign currencies, art, antiques, precious metals and other items. Further information is available from the [Nigerian Customs service](https://customs.gov.ng/?page_id=3081).
