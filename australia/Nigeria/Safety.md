# Safety

#### Security situation

If you travel to Nigeria, you're at risk of:

* terrorist attack
* kidnapping
* civil unrest
* crime

The security situation could change suddenly. You could get caught up in violence directed at others. If you travel to high-risk areas despite our advice, it is unlikely we will be able to provide consular services. Seek professional security advice and arrange personal security measures.

Violent crime is common in Nigeria, including in parts of Lagos and Abuja. Politically-motivated violence, including terrorist bombings and armed attacks, occurs frequently.

Police maintain patrols and checkpoints in many locations in Nigeria, including at entry points into, and key junctions within cities. Police officers, or people posing as police officers, may ask for bribes. Intimidation may be used, including a display of weapons. We strongly recommend you don’t drive at night (see '[Travel](#travel)').

#### Terrorism

There's a high risk of terrorist attacks in Nigeria by various militant groups. Further attacks are likely.

Terrorist attacks:

* can happen anywhere and at any time
* may specifically target religious and public holidays
* may be indiscriminate
* may target venues frequently visited by foreigners

Potential targets may include:

* hotels, bars, restaurants, markets and shopping malls
* political meetings and government buildings
* religious gatherings and places of worship
* schools and universities
* law enforcement facilities
* international organisations
* sports, concerts and other events
* transport hubs (including air, bus and train networks)
* camps for displaced people
* other places where crowds gather

Terrorists may seek to target the staff of, or locations closely associated with, foreign governments. Australian officials rarely travel outside of Abuja and Lagos, due to the high-risk security environment. Australian officials always use enhanced security measures when they travel.

Attacks can be large, simultaneous, and might include:

* explosives, including suicide bombers
* knives, machetes or other sharp-edged weapons
* gunfire
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* or a combination of the above

Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province have been active across Nigeria, especially in north-eastern states, including Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and Yobe. However, they have shown an intent and capability to launch attacks further afield, including Abuja. Over 10,000 people are estimated to have been killed by extremists in over 10 years of conflict.

Armed criminal bandit groups conduct attacks on civilians, motorists and local communities throughout Nigeria.

Armed groups often target transport routes. Avoid intercity transport by road and rail. If despite our advice you undertake travel within Nigeria, research routes and get professional security advice and support before departing.

To protect yourself from terrorism:

* always be alert to threats, especially in public places
* avoid non-essential travel
* avoid crowds, and if you must go to a crowded place, have a clear exit plan
* monitor the media for threats, curfews and other restrictions
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local news and security authorities.

If you're in a '[do not travel'](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained?#level4) area, leave if it's safe to do so.

If there's an attack, leave the area immediately. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. Victims may be held for extended periods, and in some cases executed.   
  
The threat of [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) is high in all parts of Nigeria, including in Lagos and Abuja. 

Terrorist organisations and criminal groups engage in kidnapping throughout Nigeria. 

Seaborne kidnapping in the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea regions is also a significant risk.

Kidnappers usually target locals, but foreigners have been kidnapped in the past, including Australians. Businesspeople, workers in extractives industries, tourists, journalists and humanitarian aid workers may be seen as legitimate targets.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, you should be aware that our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of being kidnapped:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs in public
* only use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

More information on how to reduce your risk of being kidnapped: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Elections

The risk of election related violence in Nigeria is high. Politically motivated murders and kidnappings have occurred. Clashes between political supporters and their opponents or government authorities are common.

While foreigners are not expected to be specifically targeted by election related violence, you may become caught up in election related events.

#### Demonstrations, protests and inter-communal violence

Foreigners generally aren't the target of civil unrest. However, you could get caught up in violence directed at others. Avoid public demonstrations, rallies and gatherings. These can occur spontaneously and may turn violent. They have sometimes been subject to forceful suppression by government security forces, including the use of live fire. Government authorities may also impose local curfews, states of emergency or suspend communications networks with little warning.

Long-standing tribal, ethnic, religious, political and community arguments can lead to violence and unrest. Recent civil unrest has included conflict between cattle herders and villagers in many rural locations of Nigeria competing over access to land and resources. In urban settings there may be clashes between rival gangs known colloquially as ‘Area Boys’. Although foreign nationals are not normally targeted, you may be caught up in an attack, especially if you're perceived to have provided support to one of the groups involved.

A 6-month state of emergency was declared in Rivers state on 18 March 2025 following militant attacks on oil infrastructure. A heightened presence of security forces is expected during this time. We continue to advise against all travel to Rivers state. If despite our advice you travel there, comply with all directions from authorities and monitor local media reporting for updates on the situation.

There have been strikes and protests over the cost of living in Nigeria in recent years. These could resume with little warning.

Trading and business disruptions have occurred as a result of strike and protest action. You should maintain stocks of essential supplies, such as food, water and petrol in anticipation of periods of unrest.

To protect yourself if you encounter a protest or local tension:

* leave and avoid the immediate affected area
* monitor local media and other sources for updates
* plan for interruptions to phone and internet services
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Nigeria's crime rate is high. Crime increases at night, particularly in major cities and on highways. Criminals have targeted foreigners, as their perceived wealth makes them attractive targets. The following forms of crime are common:

* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping") (see 'Kidnapping')
* violent and sexual [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* [armed robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and banditry
* home invasion or burglary
* carjacking
* [assaults](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and robberies on public transport or in taxis
* attacks on motorists travelling between cities (see ‘[Road travel](#travel)’).

If you're a victim of violent crime, especially [rape](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault), get immediate medical attention. Nigeria has a higher rate of HIV/AIDS infections than Australia.

#### Petty crime

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* avoid travel alone or after dark
* avoid conspicuous displays of money, devices including mobile phones, smartwatches or laptops, jewellery or expensive looking watches, in public places or in the presence of persons unknown to you
* take care when changing money or using ATMs
* secure valuable personal items when leaving hotel rooms
* arrange airport and hotel pick-ups with someone you know or by using the airport transfer arrangements of a major hotel. If you don't know the driver, make sure you check their credentials before you leave the airport
* use hotel car services rather than local taxis or rideshare apps

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or when using Bluetooth.

Social media use can be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/partying#methanol).

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you, or someone you're travelling with, has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Scams and fraud

Commercial and internet fraud often originates in Nigeria. ATM, debit and credit card fraud is also common (see 'Money').

Criminals often seek details of 'safe' bank accounts overseas, such as yours. They claim they will transfer large sums of money into the account. Victims believe they will get a percentage of the amount involved.

Be aware of other [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") where criminals:

* give fake cheques for 'urgent' shipments of goods
* ask for large fees for fake government contracts
* pretend to be calling from your financial institution
* extort money from people the scammers convince to travel to Nigeria for a business opportunity
* promise IVF or fertility treatments that involve staged births or ‘miracle babies’.

To protect yourself against a scam, be wary of:

* any request to send money to a person in Nigeria, including people you know
* any invitation to Nigeria to meet someone you have met over the internet.

Be careful about giving out personal information or disposing of personal documents while in Nigeria.

Scammers can access your personal data when you use open networks. Be careful when and where you use internet banking and other sites that transmit or store your data or passwords.

If you're travelling to Nigeria, your family and friends may receive bogus phone calls and emails from Nigeria. Scammers may claim that you're in legal, financial or medical trouble and that you need money.

Some scammers may pretend to work for the Australian High Commission in Abuja and ask you to transfer money to the High Commission. Check with the High Commission first through its official contact details if you're asked to send money or information to them (see '[Local contacts](#local-contacts)').

Don't travel to Nigeria to try to get your money back or to seek justice or revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Bogus dating schemes

Scammers in West Africa operate fake online friendship, dating and marriage schemes to defraud and threaten foreigners. They do this by targeting Australians and other foreigners on internet dating sites or chat rooms. They may pose as a prospective friend or partner and may use a completely false identity.

Once a friendship develops, the scammer may ask for money to allow them to travel to Australia. In some cases, the scammer ends the relationship once the money has been sent. There's little chance of getting the money back.

In other cases, foreigners are lured to Africa to meet their prospective friend or partner. Once in Africa, they may become the victim of kidnapping, assault, robbery or extortion.

There have also been cases of sextortion, where scammers develop a fake romantic relationship and then ask to exchange revealing photographs or videos. Once they have these, the nature of the relationship will often change abruptly, and the scammers will demand payment in exchange for not releasing these items to the victim's family, friends or work colleagues.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Nigeria experiences a rainy season from May to October. In past years, there have been significant casualties and widespread damage to infrastructure caused by severe flooding. Essential services may be disrupted. Follow the advice of local authorities and check the media for updates.

The dry season is from November to April. Temperatures may be higher than 40°C for multiple days, especially in the north.

Nigeria experiences the Harmattan from December to March. This seasonal wind blows sand and dust in the air. Dust storms are common and flights can be affected due to bad visibility.

Strong ocean currents occur along the coast. Conditions can change quickly and be challenging, even for strong swimmers. Many people drown each year.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") happens, follow the advice of local authorities.
