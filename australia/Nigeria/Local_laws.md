# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They may include long jail terms and large fines.

#### Death penalty

The death penalty can apply for serious crimes like murder and armed robbery in Nigeria.

#### Sharia law

Sharia law operates in 12 northern Nigerian states:

* Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara.

Sharia law is increasingly enforced in these areas.

Serious crimes, including stealing, adultery and blasphemy may also lead to harsh punishment under Sharia Law, including extra-judicial execution or corporal punishment. 

#### LGBTQIA+ laws

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Nigeria and largely regarded as socially unacceptable. 

It's illegal to:

* enter into a same-sex marriage or civil union
* plan or take part in a same-sex marriage ceremony
* register, operate or visit gay clubs, societies or organisations
* make any public show of a same-sex relationship
* cross-dress

Same-sex sexual activity between adults can carry severe penalties in states operating under Sharia law.

LGBTQIA+ persons are generally discriminated against in Nigeria and have been subject to harassment, verbal and physical abuse, across the country. Extra-judicial executions of LGBTQIA+ persons have been carried out in the past.

#### Other laws

It's illegal to photograph or film around:

* government buildings
* military and police sites
* diplomatic premises
* airports

Restricted areas may not be well defined or signposted. Avoid taking pictures of military or police personnel.

It's illegal to:

* smoke or litter in public places
* export African art, artefacts and antiques without a permit from the relevant authorities.

See further information on items subject to import and export restrictions for travellers from [Nigeria’s Customs service](https://customs.gov.ng/?page_id=3081), including under ‘passenger concessions’.

Local SIMs for use on the mobile phone network must be linked to a Nigerian Identification Number (NIN). Before you travel, get guidance from your network operator on whether you can use your existing number while roaming in Nigeria.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

While dual citizenship is recognised in Nigeria, it may impact our ability to offer you consular services.

If you're an Australian-Nigerian dual national and aged between 18 and 30, you may be required to join the National Youth Service Corps program.

Nigerian authorities may insist dual nationals enter and exit on a Nigerian passport.

Contact an [embassy or consulate of Nigeria](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/148) for advice before you travel.

#### Local customs

Nigeria is ethnically and religiously diverse. You should avoid behaving or dressing in ways that might offend conservative local standards or religious sensitivities, especially outside of urban areas. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws. 

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Nigeria, especially in northern Nigeria. 

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day (see 'Sharia Law'). If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
