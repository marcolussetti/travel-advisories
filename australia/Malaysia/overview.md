[Reconsider your need to travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/travel-advice-explained#level3) to the coastal region of eastern Sabah, including the islands, dive sites and associated tourist facilities, due to the high threat of kidnapping. The risk of kidnapping increases on the water and waterfront after nightfall and is highest in the area between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau.

## Overview

### Safety

* There is a risk of terrorism in Malaysia. Terrorism is a global threat. Attacks could be random and small-scale. Possible targets could include tourist areas and a range of other locations frequented by foreigners, (see Full Advice - [Safety](#safety) below), including in Kuala Lumpur. Take official warnings seriously. There was an armed attack on a police station in Johor Bahru on 17 May in which two police officers were killed.
* There's an ongoing high risk of kidnapping in the coastal areas of eastern Sabah. There have been a number of attempted and successful kidnappings. This includes islands, dive sites and tourist facilities. If, despite our advice, you travel to these areas, get professional security advice. Obey all local governments' curfews.
* Petty crime is common. Bag-snatching, including by thieves on motorbikes, happens often. When walking, hold your bag on the opposite side to the traffic. Safeguard your belongings, especially in shopping centres, at the airport and on trains. Credit card fraud is common. Always keep your credit card in sight when paying for purchases.
* Assault, sexual assault, robbery and drink spiking can occur, including in tourist areas of Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. Don't leave your food or drinks unattended. Never accept food, drinks, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Stay with people you trust at parties, bars, nightclubs and taxis. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Piracy in South-East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. Avoid travelling by boat in the southern Sulu Sea. If you intend to travel in the region by boat, check the International Maritime Bureau's [piracy reports](http://www.icc-ccs.org/). Arrange personal security measures.

### Health

* Strict rules control the importation of prescription and non-prescription medication. If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Malaysia.
* Dengue fever is common, including in major urban areas. Zika virus is also a risk. Malaria is a risk in rural areas. Other insect-borne diseases include chikungunya, filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.
* Rabies is present in Malaysia. It's fatal without immediate treatment. Avoid dogs, monkeys and other mammals. Get medical help straight away if an animal bites or scratches you.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include hepatitis, tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Private hospitals in major cities are of an international standard. You'll need to pay up-front at all hospitals unless you have travel insurance, and your travel insurance policy covers your hospitalisation. Services are more limited in rural areas. Government hospitals require a deposit even if you have travel insurance.
* Cases of pertussis (whooping cough) have increased in Sabah. Ensure you're immunised against pertussis and practice good personal hygiene.

### Local laws

* If you're suspected of using drugs, you may be required to take a urine test on arrival in Malaysia. This includes if you're travelling from a country where possession and use of drugs such as cannabis is legal. Penalties for drug offences are severe.
* Don't use, carry or traffic illegal drugs. Punishments include the death penalty.
* It's unclear if surrogacy is legal under Malaysian civil law and what conditions apply. Get legal advice before arranging a surrogacy.
* Malaysian law requires that you carry identification, such as your passport or a Malaysian Immigration Issued Card (IKAD), with you at all times. If you are asked by police and are unable to provide it, you may be detained until you can present valid identification.
* Malaysia is a multicultural but mostly Islamic country. Many areas have conservative standards of dress and behaviour, including at religious sites and government offices. Get advice on local customs.
* Malaysia enforces some aspects of sharia law. These laws apply to all Muslims, including visitors from Australia. Research laws that apply to you before you travel.
* Malaysia doesn't recognise dual nationality. Always travel on your Australian passport. If Malaysian authorities find out you're a dual citizen, you may need to renounce one of your citizenships immediately, or you may not be permitted to depart Malaysia.
