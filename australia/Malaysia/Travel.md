# Travel

#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

In most circumstances, Australian passport holders can get a 90-day tourism visa on arrival.

Arrange a visa before you travel if you're visiting for:

* business
* volunteer work
* study
* research

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [high commission, embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/121) of Malaysia for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

If you breach your visa conditions or overstay your visa, authorities may fine, detain or deport you.

Always check the correct dates are on the visa stamp placed in your passport.

Follow immigration rules, including your visa conditions.

#### Border measures

You must complete a [Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) before arrival in Malaysia. The MDAC must be submitted through the [Malaysian Immigration website](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main). See the [Malaysian Immigration website](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) for further information, including exemption details.

Malaysia has an auto gate facility for visitors from several countries, including Australia. The option to use the manual counter for a visa is still available. To use the auto gate facilities, Australian visitors must have a passport valid for at least 6 months and must complete and submit their [Malaysian Digital Arrival Card](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) (MDAC) 3 days before arriving. You will need to complete an enrolment process on arrival to be able to use the auto gates. The auto gate facility is available at Kuala Lumpur International Airport Terminals 1 and 2.

Travellers registering to use the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card will receive an email acknowledgment containing a link and a pin number to view their visit pass online after they pass through the auto gate. Travellers who use the auto gate to enter Malaysia will need to be able to take and keep a snapshot of their visit pass on their phone and present this visit pass if requested by Malaysian authorities.

The auto gate facility is unavailable for Australian passport holders with Malaysian permanent residency or a long-term pass. Further information can be found on the [Malaysia Digital Arrival Card](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) website.

Entry requirements may change at short notice. Monitor the websites of the [Malaysian Department of Immigration](https://www.imi.gov.my/), [My Safe Travel](https://mysafetravel.gov.my/), the [Malaysian Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.my/), and social media for any changes. Before travel, confirm entry requirements with the [Malaysian High Commission or Consulate-General in Australia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/121/State).

#### Staying in Malaysia

You should ensure you keep your visa up to date.

#### Other formalities

Foreigners need to provide biometric identification (fingerprints and/or face) on arrival.

Children aged younger than 12 years and visitors with finger disabilities don't have to do this.

#### Passport

Malaysian law requires that you carry identification, such as your passport or a Malaysian Immigration Issued Card (IKAD), with you at all times and electronic evidence of the visa entry if you entered via auto gates. If you are asked by police and are unable to provide this evidence, you may be detained until you can present it.

Travellers registering to use the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card will receive an email acknowledgment containing a link and a pin number to view their visit pass online after they pass through the auto gate. Travellers who use the auto gate to enter Malaysia will need to be able to take and keep a snapshot of their visit pass on their phone and present this visit pass if requested by Malaysian authorities.

#### Validity

Some countries including Malaysia won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for more than 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR).

When you depart, declare any MYR over MYR30,000, $US10,000 or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can take larger amounts out of the country if you declare it when you arrive.

ATMs are widely available.

#### Local travel

If you travel between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia, you need your passport. East Malaysia includes Sabah and Sarawak.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you for any related damage and injuries if you plan to hire:

* a car
* a motorcycle
* a jet ski
* any other vehicle

#### Driving permit

To drive in Malaysia, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

If you don't have both, you need to apply for a Malaysian licence.

#### Road travel

Motorcyclists are a common traffic hazard. They often:

* weave through traffic
* drive through red lights and pedestrian crossings
* travel on the wrong side of the road

Motorcyclists have been increasingly confronting drivers who shout, gesture or toot their horn at them. They sometimes assault drivers.

You're more likely to die in a car accident in Malaysia than in Australia.

To stay safe, drive carefully and avoid road rage.

On a motorcycle, always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Some taxi drivers, especially in tourist spots or when roads are jammed, don't use their meter. This is illegal.

Malaysia's taxi regulator has an English-language hotline for reporting problems. To make a report, call 1 800 88 7723 and provide the:

* vehicle number
* taxi company name
* time, date and location of the incident
* name of the driver if known

Always ask if the driver will use the meter, or agree the fare, before you get in a taxi.

At the start of your trip, take note of the vehicle number, the taxi company name and the name of the driver.

#### Public transport

There have been fatal and other serious accidents involving long-distance tour buses. This often happens at night or in bad weather.

If you plan to travel by bus, choose a company with a good reputation and avoid overnight travel.

#### Sea travel

In recent years, several passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and poor maintenance.

Before booking tickets on a passenger ferry, speedboat or other vessel, check there is appropriate safety equipment available.

Don't travel on any vessel that looks overloaded or in poor condition.

When you board, confirm there are enough life jackets for all passengers. Know where they are.

In bad weather, wear a life jacket, even if others don't.

There is a curfew on travel by water from 6pm to 6am in the coastal districts of eastern Sabah. See ([Safety)](#safety).

#### Airline safety

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Malaysia's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9M)with the Aviation Safety Network.

#### National parks

National parks are protected areas, and some are home to ethnic minority groups.

Be respectful of the law and customs in these areas. If in doubt, seek local advice.

Don't remove any wildlife or plants from the park.

Before entering a park, register your plans with park officials and let someone you trust know where you're going.
