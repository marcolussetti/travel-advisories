#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could happen in Malaysia. Attacks could be random and may affect locations popular with foreigners, or during major events or holidays that attract large crowds.

Malaysian authorities have arrested people for planning terror attacks. This includes attacks against entertainment venues in Kuala Lumpur.

There was an armed attack on a police station in Johor Bahru on 17 May in which two police officers were killed.

Other possible targets include:

* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* schools
* LGBTQIA+ venues and events
* markets and shopping malls
* places of worship or religious holidays
* outdoor recreation events
* tourist areas
* government facilities
* embassies
* public transport

To stay safe:

* be alert to possible threats, especially in public places
* be cautious around places known to be possible terrorist targets
* report any suspicious activity or items to police
* check the media for any new or emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Overland travel through Thailand

Read our [travel advice for Thailand](/destinations/asia/thailand "Thailand") if you're planning to go there overland.

Avoid travelling to or through the far southern provinces of Thailand.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

There's an ongoing high threat of kidnapping in the coastal areas of eastern Sabah, including islands, dive sites and other tourist facilities.

Extremists based in the southern Philippines are active in the area between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau in eastern Sabah.

Foreigners have been kidnapped from the nearby islands of Sipadan and Mataking and surrounding waters.

Some attempted and successful kidnappings have happened in coastal areas of eastern Sabah in recent years.

* In April 2024, two Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency personnel were injured in a shootout with a suspicious vessel while on patrol near Kunak.
* In May 2021, Malaysian authorities arrested eight suspected Abu Sayyaf militants who they suspect may have been planning kidnappings in Malaysia.
* In September 2019, 3 fishermen were abducted in the waters off Lahad Datu.
* In June 2019, 10 fishermen were abducted in waters between Lahad Datu, Sabah and Sitangkai, Southern Philippines.
* In December 2018, 3 fishermen were abducted from Pegasus Reef near Kinabatangan, Sabah.
* In November 2016, militants based in the southern Philippines attacked a yacht in waters between eastern Sabah and the Sulu archipelago. One German national was killed and another kidnapped and later killed.  Further in 2016, some commercial seamen were kidnapped from cargo vessels in the area.
* In May 2015, gunmen entered a local seaside restaurant in Sandakan and abducted the manager and one customer.

Malaysian authorities increased security in the region in response to kidnapping incidents. The Sabah Government has restricted the use of waterways.

#### Security measures

There's a 6pm to 6am curfew on water travel in 6 coastal districts of eastern Sabah state. This includes offshore areas up to 3 nautical miles (5.5km) from the coast.

All vessels travelling in the waters off Lahad Datu and Sandakan in daylight hours must get a permit or permission from police.

Vessels must travel only on designated routes.

There's a ban on resort-organised water activities at night. This includes diving and fishing.

Authorities established the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone), which includes the regions of:

* Beluran
* Kinabatangan
* Kota Marudu
* Kudat
* Kunak
* Lahad Datu
* Pitas
* Sandakan
* Semporna
* Tawau

There's an increased presence of security forces in the ESSZone.

Authorities may extend the water travel curfew each fortnight. If you travel by water during curfew hours without permission, authorities could fine you or jail you for up to 6 months.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.  

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:  

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

You could encounter protests or demonstrations on the streets or at certain venues.

Protest activity could lead to violence and disrupt public services, including public transport, and cause traffic congestion. However, this is rare.

Police permission is needed for public gatherings and demonstrations. If you take part in a protest or demonstration, authorities could arrest and deport you.

Avoid protests and demonstrations.

During periods of unrest:

* check the news and other sources for information on planned and possible unrest or strikes
* follow the advice of local authorities
* plan your activities to avoid unrest on national or commemorative days
* be ready to change your travel plans

If civil unrest disrupts your transport plans, contact your airline, travel agent or insurer for help.

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common.

Opportunistic pickpocketing and snatch-and-grab [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") happen often where thieves snatch handbags, shoulder bags, jewellery, mobile phones and other valuables from pedestrians.

Hotspots include busy pedestrian crossings near major shopping malls, including within the KLCC area.

Motorcyclists, and sometimes thieves in other moving vehicles, pull bags from victims. This often causes injuries.

Smash-and-grab attacks against slow-moving and parked vehicles also happen.

To avoid petty crime:

* don't carry bags that are easy to snatch
* walk on footpaths when you can and stay away from the curb
* hold your bag on the opposite side to the traffic
* when driving or parking your car, keep valuables out of sight
* always keep vehicle windows up and doors locked, even when moving

Handbags, expensive watches, jewellery, mobile phones and cameras are tempting targets for thieves.

Many travellers have lost passports and other valuables to thieves on trains and at airports.

Carry only what you need and leave other valuables, in a secure location.

Thieves sometimes work in groups at busy shopping centres. One or more may approach you with stories of distress or warnings for your safety. When you're distracted, others steal your belongings.

Watch your personal belongings, especially:

* in crowded areas and during holiday periods
* when travelling on trains from the airport
* at airports

Be wary of approaches from strangers, especially in shopping centres.

#### Credit card fraud

Credit card fraud is common.

Credit cards are often copied for illegal use. This can happen anywhere, from small shops to large department stores and hotels.

Always keep your credit card in sight.

#### Online scams

Online [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") have increased in recent years. Scammers often pretend to be people in need of financial help.

They prey on people looking for companions on online dating websites.

To protect yourself from being scammed:

* be wary of people asking for money
* don't send money or provide your bank details to anyone you don't know
* be careful when sharing personal information with people you haven't met in person

Scams involving gambling are also common.

#### Violent crime

You could experience violent crime in Malaysia. Australians have been victims of violent crime in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and other areas of the country. You should exercise vigilance and take sensible precautions. If you're a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.

Incidents of assault, sexual assault, robbery and drink spiking, including in tourist areas of Kuala Lumpur and Penang have occurred. Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [Partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Don't leave your food or drinks unattended. Never accept food, drinks, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Stay with people you trust at parties, bars, nightclubs and taxis.

To stay safe while using taxis:

* don't hail taxis on the street, especially after dark
* book taxis by phone at a shopping centre taxi desk
* check there's a licence with photo on the dashboard or seat back before getting into a taxi
* check the driver matches the photo.

If you're alone in a taxi, sit in the back seat. Keep your belongings with you in the taxi.

If your taxi stops to pick up other passengers, get out of the taxi when it's safe to do so. Taxi drivers aren't allowed to pick up extra passengers, but it sometimes happens.

E-hailing services are available. Use the same precautions as taxis.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").

Incidents of assault, sexual assault, robbery and drink spiking, including in tourist areas of Kuala Lumpur and Penang have occurred. Don't leave your food or drinks unattended. Never accept food, drinks, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Stay with people you trust at parties, bars, nightclubs and taxis.

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Malaysia experiences [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") and [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), including:

* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* flooding
* landslides
* severe rainstorms
* heatwaves

If there's a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* keep in contact with your friends and family
* monitor local media and weather reports
* follow the advice of local authorities
* check with tour operators before travelling to affected areas

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Earthquakes and tsunamis

Earthquakes can happen in Malaysia.

Coastal regions of the world can experience tsunamis. Malaysia and its neighbours are vulnerable to earthquakes, which make destructive tsunamis more likely.

**More information:**

* [US Tsunami Warning Centre](https://www.tsunami.gov/)

#### Severe weather

Flooding and landslides are common during the wet season which is usually from October to February.

Severe rainstorms can result in deaths and extensively damaged infrastructure.

Essential services can be interrupted.

#### Tours and adventure activities

The safety standards you might expect of transport and tour operators aren't always met. This includes for adventure activities, such as diving.

Operators may not provide enough safety equipment. They also may not pay attention to maintenance standards and safety precautions.

If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check your travel insurance covers you for it
* ask and insist on minimum safety requirements
* use available safety equipment, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If appropriate safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Piracy

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") in South-East Asian waters is an ongoing problem, especially in the:

* Strait of Malacca
* waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines

The [International Maritime Bureau (IMB)](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) issues weekly piracy reports.

Avoid travelling by boat in the southern Sulu Sea. This includes waters between Sabah, Malaysia and Palawan in the Philippines.

If you decide to travel by boat in these regions:

* check [IMB piracy](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) reports
* get local advice
* arrange security measures
