# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Malaysian law requires that you carry identification, such as your passport or a Malaysian Immigration Issued Card (IKAD), with you at all times and electronic evidence of the visa entry if you entered via auto gates. If you are asked by police and you are unable to provide this evidence, you may be detained until you can present it (see '[Travel](#travel)').

#### Drugs

If you're suspected of using drugs before you visit Malaysia, you may be required to take a urine test on arrival. This includes if you're travelling from a country where possession and use of drugs such as cannabis is legal.

Penalties for drug offences are severe, including drug possession and the presence of drugs in your bloodstream. Malaysia still carries the death penalty for drug trafficking.

#### Surrogacy laws

Malaysian civil law applies to everyone in Malaysia. Under this law, it's unclear if surrogacy is legal and what conditions apply.

Under sharia law, surrogacy is illegal. However, sharia law only applies to Muslims.

Surrogacy isn't practised openly in Malaysia. If you want to pursue surrogacy, it's mostly a private arrangement between you and the surrogate.

Get independent legal advice before entering into a surrogacy arrangement.

#### Sharia law

Malaysia enforces some aspects of sharia law. These laws apply to all Muslims, including those from Australia.

Research laws that apply to you before you travel.

#### Serious crime

Crimes that may attract corporal punishment include:

* certain drug offences
* commercial crime
* rape
* robbery

#### LGBTQIA+ law

Same-sex sexual relations are illegal.

Punishment can include whipping and up to 20 years in prison for same-sex acts involving either men or women.

#### Drink driving

Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is a serious offence, which can result in fines and/or a jail sentence. Authorities strictly enforce these laws.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

Malaysia is a multicultural but mostly Islamic country.

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in many areas. This includes at religious sites and government offices.

Always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions.

Learn about customs at your destination. If in doubt, get advice from locals. Take care not to offend cultural or religious beliefs.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](/news-and-updates/travelling-during-ramadan "Travelling during Ramadan") is observed in Malaysia. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Explore our [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) page to learn more, including dates for Ramadan.

#### Dual citizenship

Malaysia doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

If Malaysian authorities find out you hold both Australian and Malaysian citizenship, you may need to renounce either your Australian or Malaysian citizenship straight away, or you may not be permitted to depart Malaysia.
