#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a specialised insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations if, despite our advice, you're travelling to the coastal region of eastern Sabah.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Malaysia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Strict rules control the importation of prescription and non-prescription medication. Contact the [high commission or embassy of Malaysia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/121) to check what documentation local authorities may need you to have. Further information can be found on the [Pharmaceuticals Services](https://www.pharmacy.gov.my/v2/en/documents/travellers-guide-bringing-medication-malaysia.html) website.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk in rural areas. It's less common in urban and coastal areas. Consider taking medicine to prevent malaria.

Outbreaks of other insect-borne diseases can happen. This includes [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya ) and [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis).

[Rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies) is a potentially fatal viral disease. It's found in dogs, monkeys, bats and other mammals.

The most recent cases were reported in Sarawak. It was transmitted through feral dog and cat bites.

Rabies can also be contracted when a rabid animal's saliva gets directly into your eyes, nose, mouth or broken skin.

Avoid direct contact with dogs and other mammals.

If a dog, monkey or other mammal bites or scratches you, use soap and water straight away to wash the wound thoroughly.

Get urgent medical attention.

#### Marine stings

Stings from jellyfish and other marine animals can be fatal.

Ask local authorities, your tour operator or hotel about:

Avoid temporary black henna tattoos as they often contain a dye that can cause serious skin reactions.

#### Medical care

You can find private hospitals with international-standard facilities in major cities.

Public hospitals in major cities have a good range of medical services. However, access can be slow. Services are more limited in rural areas.

Most private hospitals need a cash deposit or a confirmation of insurance before they will admit you. They also expect immediate payment for services.

You need to pay up-front for treatment at government hospitals.

There are decompression chambers in:

* Kuantan

* Ipoh
* Semporna
* Labuan

#### Medical tourism

[Medical tourism](/before-you-go/health/medical-tourism "Going overseas for a medical procedure (medical tourism)"), including for cosmetic surgery, is common.

Before travelling for medical tourism:

* research and choose medical service providers carefully
* don't use discount or uncertified medical service providers
* check your travel insurance covers you if things go wrong with your surgery, as most don't
