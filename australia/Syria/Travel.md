#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. If you travel to Syria despite our advice and don't have Syrian identity documents, you'll need a visa.

You can apply for a Syrian [EVisa](https://www.evisa.sy/home-content) online.

You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Syria for the latest requirements before you go to Syria.

Parts of Syria are controlled by groups that may issue local travel permits. But you'll still need a visa issued by the Syrian Government if travelling to Syria.

#### Border measures

Land border crossings between Syria and Lebanon have been the target of border clashes and bombings and could close without notice.

For measures regarding travel between Syria and Lebanon, contact Syrian and Lebanese authorities. 

Due to the ongoing unpredictable security situation, Lebanese General Security have advised they will no longer allow dual Australian/Syrian nationals entry into Lebanon to renew expired Australian passports. Only holders of valid Australian passports can enter Lebanon. 

If you have a residence permit, check with Syrian Immigration regarding the 'exit and return' requirements.

Be aware that:

* children born in Syria must have their father's permission to leave Syria
* a Syrian husband can stop his wife from leaving the country, regardless of her nationality
* unmarried women can be prevented from leaving Syria due to strict family controls

#### Travel to Israel

If there's evidence that you've travelled to Israel, authorities will refuse your entry to Syria or deport you. Evidence includes:

* Israeli exit or entry stamps in your passport
* Egyptian or Jordanian stamps from border crossings with Israel
* travel itineraries or tickets that include Israel as a destination
* souvenirs from Israel
* airline tags on your bags
* SIM cards, literature, or other items with obvious links to Israel

#### Leaving Syria

Leave Syria immediately by commercial means.

Contact local authorities for the latest information on travelling between Syria and bordering countries. Entry and exit requirements may change without notice. Few commercial airlines fly to Syria. Other commercial air services and airports could stop operating without notice.

Civilian airports could come under attack at any time, including in Damascus and Aleppo.

Telecommunication and travel restrictions may limit your exit options:

* transport options to airports and seats on flights may be limited
* roads may close or be blocked without warning, affecting access to border crossings
* major highways may be blocked
* border crossings can be closed with little or no warning
* conflict can limit access to all border crossings

To minimise risks to your safety:

* seek local and expert advice
* make contingency plans
* check the status of routes to airports and borders
* always carry your passport and travel documents

#### Other formalities

Check with your nearest Syrian Embassy or Consulate for regulations regarding bringing in electronic devices such as standalone GPS, handheld radio equipment and drones to Syria.   
  
Do not use mobile phones at check points.

The Syrian Government enforces restrictions on prior travel to Israel.

Authorities can hold anyone, regardless of their nationality, for questioning for several days and then deport them.

#### Passport

#### Validity

If you travel to Syria despite our advice, note that some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply this rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You may end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure if it will be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Syrian Pound (SYP).

You can change money in government banks or at recognised exchange bureaus.

It is not possible to make an international money transfer because of sanctions.

Credit cards may not be accepted in Syria. You may not be able to access your money via ATMs.

#### Local travel

#### Local restrictions

Travel within some parts of Syria can be particularly dangerous.

If you're in Syria despite our advice, consider the security environment before travelling within the country. See [Safety](#safety)

#### Road travel

Access to international border crossings may be limited due to roadblocks, road closures and fighting. This can happen with little to no warning.

Major highways may become or are already blocked, due to conflict. These include:

* Tartous-Latakia
* Tartous-Homs
* Latakia-Aleppo
* Homs-Hama
* Homs-Damascus
* Damascus-Jordan
* Damascus-Beirut

If you need to travel by road, first:

* get local information on possible routes
* seek professional security advice
* adopt effective personal security measures
* make contingency plans

#### Sea travel

Don't travel to Syria by sea due to the dangerous security situation.

#### Air travel

Ongoing conflict in Syria may increase risks to civil aviation in the region. Civil aviation authorities in a number of countries do not allow airlines from those countries to fly in Syrian airspace. If you travel to Syria despite our advice, refer to the Smartraveller page on [air travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/air-travel#paths) and check with airlines before booking.  Flight paths are subject to change.  Check with your airline for updates and departure options. 

DFAT does not provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.
