# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to Syria due to the dangerous security situation and the threat of armed conflict, air strikes, terrorism, arbitrary detention and kidnapping. The security situation remains volatile. Armed clashes are ongoing in parts of Syria and have resulted in many civilian casualties. If you’re in Syria despite our advice, shelter in place and leave when it's safe to do so. If you're in Syria, despite our advice, avoid possible terrorist and military targets. Airports and airlines may suspend operations without notice.   
  
Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions. Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.  
  
Land border crossings between Syria and Lebanon have been the target of border clashes and bombings and could close without notice. If you're planning to cross a land border from Syria, contact the relevant authorities in your destination country for entry requirements (see 'Travel'). Entry and exit requirements for Syria may change without notice.

## Overview

### Safety

* We continue to advise do not travel to Syria due to the dangerous security situation and the threat of armed conflict, air strikes, terrorism, arbitrary detention and kidnapping. The security situation remains volatile. Armed clashes are ongoing in parts of Syria and have resulted in many civilian casualties. If you’re in Syria despite our advice, shelter in place and leave when it's safe to do so.
* Land border crossings may be closed without notice. Additional road closures and checkpoints may be established. Airports and airlines may suspend operations without notice.
* Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* Foreigners, especially aid workers and journalists, have been kidnapped. Vary your routines so your movements don't become obvious to others.
* Protests can turn violent. Authorities have arrested people near demonstrations, regardless of their citizenship. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Serious crime occurs, including violent robberies, kidnappings and carjackings. Keep your vehicle doors locked and windows up, even when moving. Carry only what you need.

### Health

* The Syrian health sector is seriously degraded due to conflict and lack of funding, and access to hospitals and medicines is very limited. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. This is expensive and hard to organise. The Australian Government won't organise evacuation or pay for these costs.
* Insect-borne diseases, such as leishmaniasis, are common. Malaria occurs in the northern border region, particularly in Al Hasakah Province. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. These include brucellosis, typhoid and hepatitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked foods and unpasteurised dairy products.

### Local laws

* Don't use or carry drugs. Penalties for drug offences include the death sentence.
* Get professional legal advice if you're involved in local legal matters, especially family or business law.
* Be careful when taking photos. It's illegal to photograph military and government buildings and other sensitive infrastructure.
* Using a drone is illegal and could result in a severe penalty.
* Always carry ID. It's required by law.
* Syria recognises dual nationality. However, if you're an Australian-Syrian dual national, Syrian authorities will treat you as Syrian. If you're a male dual national, you may have to do military service if you go to Syria. Contact your nearest [Syrian Embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/192/State) for details.
* Same-sex relations are illegal in Syria.

### Travel

* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. If you travel to Syria despite our advice, and don't have Syrian identity documents, you'll need a visa. You should contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Syria for the latest requirements.
* Lebanese General Security have advised they will no longer allow dual Australian/Syrian nationals entry into Lebanon to renew expired Australian passports. Only holders of valid Australian passports can enter Lebanon.
* Contact local authorities for the latest information on travelling between Syria and bordering countries. Entry and exit measures may change without notice.
* Leave Syria as soon as you can. Most commercial airlines have stopped flying to Syria. Commercial air services and airports could be attacked or stop operating at any time. Roads and border crossings may be blocked without warning. Plan your exit carefully to minimise safety risks.
* Ongoing conflict in Syria may increase risks to civil aviation in the region. Civil aviation authorities in several countries do not allow their airlines to fly in Syrian airspace.
* The local currency is the Syrian Pound (SYP). The economy is primarily cash-based. Your credit cards and ATM cards may not work.
* The SYP continues to depreciate heavily, and high inflation can drastically affect the cost of everyday goods. Ensure you have enough cash for your stay,
