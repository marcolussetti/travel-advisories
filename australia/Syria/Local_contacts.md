#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Syria. The ability of the Australian Government to provide consular help in Syria is severely limited.

The Romanian Embassy in Damascus may be able to provide limited emergency consular services to Australians in Syria. They provide these services under a consular assistance arrangement in conjunction with the Australian Embassy in Beirut.
