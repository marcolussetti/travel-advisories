#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Syria.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

There is a shortage of medicine due to conflict and degradation of the healthcare system.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Syria. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Polio

Syria is exposed to the international spread of [polio](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/poliovirus-infection).

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases, such as [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis), are common.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs in the northern border region, particularly in Al Hasakah Province.

To protect yourself from disease:​ ​

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, a rash or a severe headache.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Access to hospitals is limited due to Syria’s seriously degraded healthcare system. The quality of healthcare in Syria is low.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with suitable facilities. Medical evacuation is expensive and hard to organise. The Australian Government won't organise evacuation or pay for these costs.
