# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include the death penalty.

#### Other laws

If you're involved in local legal matters, get professional advice. Know your rights and responsibilities, especially in family law matters like:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support

Serious crime such as murder have the death penalty.

These activities are illegal in Syria:

* same-sex relationships
* taking photos of military or government buildings or other sensitive infrastructure

#### Australian laws

It's illegal under Australian law for Australian citizens, including dual citizens, to support any armed groups in Syria. This includes:

* joining the conflict
* funding, training or recruiting someone to fight
* supplying or funding weapons

Australia has [imposed sanctions on Syria](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/security/sanctions/sanctions-regimes/syria-sanctions-regime), including restrictions on the export and supply of certain goods and services.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Syria recognises dual nationality.

If you're an Australian-Syrian dual national, Syrian authorities will treat you as Syrian. This limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Children of Syrian men obtain Syrian citizenship automatically at birth.

#### Military service

Syria has compulsory military service.

If you're a male dual national, you may have to do military service if you go to Syria. Having an Australian passport won't get you out of military service.

#### Local customs

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative, particularly around religious sites.

If you're female, wear loose clothing that covers your arms and legs. Wear a headscarf.

Take care not to offend. If in doubt, seek local advice.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holiday month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Syria. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
