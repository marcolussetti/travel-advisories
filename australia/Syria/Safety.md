# Safety

#### Armed conflict and terrorism

Armed clashes are ongoing in parts of Syria and have resulted in many civilian casualties. Additional road closures and checkpoints may be established. Shelter in place and leave when it’s safe to do so.  

The security situation in Syria is dangerous due to:

* ongoing military conflict, including air strikes
* high levels of violence
* civil unrest and political tensions
* terrorist attacks
* kidnappings involving foreigners

Land border crossings may be closed without notice. Additional road closures and checkpoints may be established. Airports and airlines may suspend operations without notice.

Chemical weapons have been used during the conflict in Syria. These weapons could be used again.

If you're in Syria despite this advice, prepare to leave as soon as possible.

While you're in Syria you should:

* seek professional security advice
* adopt effective personal security measures
* stay in a safe place and limit your movements
* always be alert
* keep a low profile
* vary your routines so your movements don't become obvious to others
* avoid possible targets for a terrorist or military attack
* have a clear exit plan in case there's a security incident

If there's an attack:

* leave the area as soon as it's safe
* avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks
* monitor the media for any new or emerging threats

The security situation means access to food, water and fuel can be difficult. You should stockpile essential goods, including toiletries and prescription medication.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

There is a very serious threat of kidnapping throughout Syria. Kidnappings can occur for political or financial gain. Criminal and terrorist kidnappings are also a significant risk in Syria. There have been multiple cases of kidnappings in Syria, including of foreign nationals. 

The situation in Syria remains volatile and there are numerous terrorist and militant groups operating throughout the country. Among the terrorist groups are Islamic State (IS) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). These terrorist groups are known to use the kidnapping of foreigners as a tactic. This includes targeting aid workers, journalists and those working in the tourism and business sectors. Foreigners have been assassinated by these terrorist groups.  
  
If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited. 

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone
* notify family or friends of planned travel and share your location
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.  
   
Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation in the region remains unpredictable and could deteriorate with little or no warning.

Public protests and events with large groups of people can turn violent.

Syrian authorities have arrested people near demonstrations, regardless of their citizenship.

Civil unrest may limit your ability to travel by road.

If you're in Syria despite our advice:

* avoid rallies, demonstrations and crowds
* avoid funerals and mourning processions
* avoid areas where people congregate after Friday midday prayers
* monitor the media for new safety and security risks, including political events that could increase tensions

#### Crime

The breakdown in law and order has led to an increase in crime, including:

* [violent robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* [kidnappings](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* carjackings

If you're in Syria despite our advice:

* avoid showing signs of wealth
* drive with your doors locked and windows up
* secure your accommodation
* stay alert to your surroundings

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Syria is subject to [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis"). Dust storms and sandstorms also happen, especially during the summer months when there have been long periods of dry weather.
