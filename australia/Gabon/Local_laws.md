# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include long prison sentences in local jails.

#### Other laws

Ensure you carry your identification and evidence of the purpose of your visit at all times. Local security forces may interpret laws broadly and inconsistently. You could break the law without intending to. The Australian Government can’t intervene in local judicial processes.

It's illegal to photograph:

* airports
* the Presidential Palace
* government buildings
* military sites
* border posts

It's illegal to buy or sell endangered wildlife products without a licence. This includes ivory and rhino horn.

Local laws may change without notice.

#### LGBTQIA+ information

Same-sex relationships aren't legally recognised.

Local communities can be intolerant towards same-sex relationships, so avoid public displays of affection.

There have been attempts to charge people in same-sex marriages under public order and obscenity laws.
