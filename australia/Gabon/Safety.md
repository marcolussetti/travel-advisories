# Safety

#### Crime

Petty crime is common, including:

* pickpocketing
* bag snatching
* vehicle break-ins

Hotspots for thieves include crowded:

* markets
* transport hubs
* tourist areas

#### Violent crime

There have been reports of violent crime, especially in Libreville and Port Gentil. Incidents include [robberies](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/344) and armed attacks.

Travellers have been victims of:

* carjackings
* 'snatch–and-grab' robberies from unlocked cars
* violent road rage

Victims have been targeted when walking alone or at night. This is more common in isolated areas or on beaches.

There are reports of credit card fraud originating in Gabon.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* do not walk alone or visit beaches and isolated areas alone, especially at night
* always keep car windows and doors locked, even when moving
* watch your credit card at all times, including during transactions
* monitor local media for updates about safety or security risks

If you're a victim of violent crime, including [rape](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/355), go to the doctor or a hospital straight away. HIV/AIDS is common in Gabon.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Gabon has had a transitional government since a military takeover in August 2023 and is scheduled to hold its first Presidential election on 12 April 2025. While the situation has been stable, local authorities have maintained a higher security alert level in Libreville and other areas of Gabon. Protests and civil unrest related to the elections may occur with little warning and may turn violent.  
   
Ensure you carry identification and evidence of the purpose of your travel. Local authorities may inspect your documentation. Avoid protests, polling booths and government buildings. Curfews may be imposed without notice. If a curfew is imposed, ensure you follow any requirements. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people may occur with little warning and can turn violent. Demonstrations are more common in Libreville and Port Gentil.

Demonstrations and protests may be more likely during the campaign period, on election day and after the announcement of results.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations, protests and large gatherings
* monitor local media
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities
