#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa conditions

You should get a visa to enter Gabon. Those entering Gabon under visa-free arrangements have experienced immigration issues during their stay.

You also need a letter of invitation or sponsorship from your accommodation or sponsoring partner outlining the purpose of your visit and the duration of your stay. The letter should be in French and contain the author's contact details. You'll need to show the letter to immigration officials on arrival.

Gabon doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Australia. Gabon's nearest embassy is in Tokyo.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate for the latest details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

While the situation has stabilised, political and security sensitivities mean that travel to and from Gabon may be disrupted. This could include difficulties obtaining a visa or borders being closed at short notice. Monitor local media for updates.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Gabon. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Central African CFA Franc (XAF).

Declare all amounts of local or foreign currency more than XAF200,000 on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You can only cash traveller's cheques at larger banks in major cities. The cheques must be in either euros or US dollars.

Gabon is largely a cash-based economy.

Credit cards aren't widely accepted, except at major hotels and restaurants.

Ask your bank if your cards will work in Gabon.

You'll find ATMs in major centres. Take care when using ATMs because thieves may target you. See the [Safety](#safety) section for more information.

#### Local travel

French is the official language. English isn't widely spoken.

#### Local restrictions

Restrictions and government requirements for internal travel within Gabon may change without notice. Seek local advice before internal travel, particularly when travelling to areas not frequented by tourists. When travelling within Gabon, local authorities may inspect your documentation. Always carry evidence of the purpose of your travel for presentation on request.

Travelling with a reputable Ecotourism operator is not a guarantee that your travel plans will not be subject to restrictions.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Gabon, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must obtain your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads
* poorly maintained and overloaded vehicles
* local driving practices
* poor lighting and road signs, especially outside urban areas

Travel outside of major urban centres usually requires a 4WD vehicle.

Towing and repair services aren't common outside Libreville.

There are police roadblocks throughout the country. You may be asked to show your identity and motor vehicle registration papers.

Check you have adequate travel insurance coverage before driving.

If you hire a vehicle, confirm with your rental company what you're required to carry in your vehicle, such as:

* licensing documents
* proof of insurance
* safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher

To reduce your risks if you plan to drive:

* get to know local traffic laws and practices
* be alert to pedestrians, animals and other hazards on the road
* avoid travelling at night
* get local advice on road conditions, especially during the rainy season

If you're involved in a traffic accident, go to the nearest police station to avoid possible confrontations.

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance policy may not cover you when riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

#### Taxis

To reduce risks when using taxis:

* negotiate the fare with the driver before entering the taxi
* avoid using taxis alone or at night
* ask the driver not to pick up other passengers
* only use authorised taxis
* use hotel taxi and limousine services if they're available
