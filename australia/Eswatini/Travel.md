#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

Tourists can enter Eswatini for up to 30 days without a visa. Your passport must be valid for six months after departure from Eswatini and have two blank pages. You'll need to get a visa in advance for other types of visits.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/189) for visa details, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Entry by Vehicle

If you enter by vehicle other than one registered in Eswatini, you'll have to complete a customs declaration form at border posts on entry and departure. A road fund levy of SZL100 is payable at the border, there's no Bureau to Change, South African Rand is accepted.

You must always carry the customs declaration form and the road fund levy payment in the vehicle. Vehicles may be searched at borders.

This process can cause lengthy delays, plan your travel accordingly.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country with two blank pages. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months with two blank pages.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service.](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.
