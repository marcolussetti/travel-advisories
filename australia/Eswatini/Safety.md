# Safety

#### Crime

Police resources are varied throughout Eswatini.

#### Petty crime

Petty crime is common in major towns, particularly Mbabane and Manzini. This includes pickpocketing and [robbery](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery").

Take care to protect your personal belongings.

Be particularly careful in major towns.

#### Violent crime

Violent crime, including armed [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") and carjacking, can occur.

Safety risks are greater at night, including on roads and in rural areas.

There have been reports of carjacking along major routes from South Africa and Mozambique, especially at night.

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid walking alone, particularly at night and in isolated areas
* keep car doors locked, windows up and valuables out of sight, including when moving
* avoid driving into and out of Eswatini at night due to the threat of carjacking

Due to the high rate of HIV/AIDS, seek medical help straight away if you're a victim of violent crime, especially [sexual assault](/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault "Reducing the risk of sexual assault and harassment").

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Cyber Security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

* report any suspicious items or activities to the police
* take official warnings seriously
* monitor the media for threats
