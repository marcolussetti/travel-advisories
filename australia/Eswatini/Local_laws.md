# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Ask police or prison officials to contact the Australian High Commission in South Africa if you're arrested or detained.

Police resources are varied throughout Eswatini.

#### Death penalty

Serious offences, including murder and treason, carry the death penalty. Corporal punishment exists, including for children.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include mandatory prison sentences.

In Eswatini, it's illegal to:

* possess pornography
* take photos of government buildings, military installations, armed forces, royal residences or official ceremonies
* engage in same-sex relationships

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Eswatini doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you're a dual national, this limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.
