#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of someone you know, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Eswatini. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is very high.

Take precautions if taking part in activities that put you at risk of infection.

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) occurs year-round in most areas except in Mbabane and Highveld (the Highlands).

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* sleep under treated mosquito nets
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

See a doctor if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases occur. This includes:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water to avoid contact with waterborne diseases

To reduce your risk of rabies, don't go near dogs and other mammals. If you're bitten or scratched, seek medical help straight away.

See a doctor if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

The standard of medical facilities is low. There can be shortages of basic medicine.

Hospitals will ask you to confirm your insurance cover or pay up-front before treatment.

If you're seriously ill or injured, you could need treatment at a more suitable place. This is usually South Africa. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
