#### Crime

Violent crime is increasing in Paraguay, including in the capital Asuncion and tourist areas such as San Pedro and Concepcion. Incidents include armed [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault), car theft and [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping). 

If attacked or robbed, don’t resist as muggers are occasionally violent and can be armed.

Transnational criminal organisations carry out drug trafficking and arms smuggling, particularly along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil. This is most prevalent from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina.

Pickpocketing and other petty crime is common in major cities, and on public transport. Hotspots for petty crime include Asuncion, Ciudad del Este and Pedro Juan Caballero. 

Thieves on motorbikes sometimes steal from pedestrians or threaten them with weapons.

To protect yourself from crime:

* be alert in tourist locations, crowded public places and downtown areas
* avoid walking after dark
* only use ATMs in controlled areas such as banks and shopping malls and avoid using them after dark
* ask your hotel about areas to avoid downtown
* ensure your belongings are secure at all times, particularly when using public transport
* use registered taxis
* keep car windows closed, doors locked at all times and keep valuables out of sight
* do not leave valuables in your car, including in the boot.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and large events can turn violent. Protests occur frequently, usually in downtown Asuncion close to government offices, and can lead to roadblocks and road closures causing severe traffic congestion.

To protect yourself during periods of civil unrest:

* avoid protests and demonstrations
* don't cross roadblocks
* monitor the media for updates
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals,  concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas while travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

High-profile kidnappings have occurred in the country’s interior, including areas where a small guerrilla style group known as the Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo (EPP) or Army of the Paraguayan People, operates. The EPP operates in parts of Concepcion, Amambay, San Pedro and Canindeyu. 

Kidnappers can be violent. Foreign nationals are occasionally targeted. 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Climate and natural disasters

The rainy season is from December to March. Heavy rains can disrupt public transport schedules. Floods can occur.

Monitor regional weather forecasts to plan your travel.

If a [natural disaster](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) occurs, follow the advice of local authorities.
