## Overview

### Safety

* Theft, armed assault, kidnapping and other violent crimes occur in Paraguay, including in tourist areas and on public transport. Secure your valuables. If attacked or robbed, don't resist.
* Avoid large public gatherings and protests. These can turn violent. They may also lead to roadblocks and congestion. Don't cross roadblocks, even if they're unattended.
* Be alert when travelling to interior parts of the country, including San Pedro and Concepcion. A small guerrilla-style group, Ejercito del Pueblo Paraguayo (EPP), operates in these regions. Kidnappings have occurred.
