#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest [Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring any medication, check if it's legal in Paraguay. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

There's a risk of [yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever) in Paraguay. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Zika virus](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/flavivirus-infection-including-zika-virus?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation) is also common across Paraguay. If you're pregnant, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care recommends that you:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

Other common insect-borne disease risks include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)

Insect-borne disease outbreaks have occurred in Asuncion, Concepcion and Ciudad del Este.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a significant risk. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include, but are not limited to:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid)
* [hepatitis A](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-a)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)

To protect yourself from illness:

* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid bathing in fresh water, such as lakes and rivers

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical care is adequate in major cities but is limited in smaller cities and rural areas.

Hospitals often need an up-front payment or proof of medical insurance before they'll treat you, even in an emergency.
