#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

Australian passport holders don't require visitor visas to enter Paraguay when they travel on a regular passport for up to 90 days.

Ensure your passport is stamped, signed, and dated by immigration when entering Paraguay, especially when entering at a land border. If you don't, you'll have to pay a fine when you leave. 

Entry and exit conditions can change. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Paraguay](https://www.mre.gov.py/index.php/representaciones/embajadas-del-paraguay-en-el-mundo) for details about visas, currency, customs and other travel requirements.

#### Other formalities

#### Travelling with children

Children under the age of 18, with a birthplace or residency in Paraguay, [must leave Paraguay with a legalised authorisation](https://www.migraciones.gov.py/index.php/tramites/ingreso-y-salida-del-pais/requerimientos-migratorios-de-ingreso-y-salida-del-paraguay-de-menores) from any non-accompanying parent(s). A birth certificate may be required to verify the parents. If one of the parents is deceased, a death certificate will need to accompany the birth certificate.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting a new passport.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate.](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas)

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of Paraguay is the Guarani (PYG).

Declare all amounts over USD $10,000 (or its foreign equivalent) on arrival and departure. This covers all forms of currency. Failing to do so is a violation and can result in the seizure and forfeiture of your money. 

Use registered banks or an exchange bureau to change money. Avoid changing money with people on the streets. Counterfeit notes are common.

You may need to show ID when paying with a credit or debit card.

Traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted.

#### Local travel

Take care if you travel to the north-eastern provinces of:

* Concepcion
* San Pedro
* Amambay
* Canindeyu

Illegal cross-border activities are common and may become violent.

If hiking in remote areas, register your details with park authorities. Research local natural hazards and conditions before you go.

#### Road travel

You're more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident in Paraguay than in Australia.

Driving in Paraguay can be dangerous. Hazards include:

* poor driving standards
* disregard for traffic regulations
* poorly maintained roads and vehicles, especially outside urban areas
* unsealed roads
* stray animals on the road in rural areas
* vehicles without headlights on rural roads

The network of sealed roads in Paraguay is limited. Heavy rains can make some roads impassable.

If you plan to drive in Paraguay:

* You will need an international driving permit.
* check you have adequate travel insurance
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* avoid driving at night in rural areas

#### Taxis

Taxis are often in poor condition and many don't have functioning seat belts.

Some taxis may appear to be official but aren't registered. There are reports of passengers being robbed in unregistered taxis.

If you need to take a taxi:

* use only registered taxi companies or ride-hailing apps which are available in major cities
* after dark, book registered taxis by phone or at major hotels

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Paraguay's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/countries/ZP) with the Aviation Safety Network.
