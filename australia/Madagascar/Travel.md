#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Madagascar. If you’re a tourist, you can apply for a visa for up to 60 days on arrival at the airport. You’ll need to show evidence of onward or return travel. Visitor visas are for single-entry only.

For trips shorter than 15 days there’s no visa fee, however you’ll need to pay a 10 euro administration fee for border control formalities. There are fees for 30 or 60 day visas. These can be paid in euros, US dollars or Malagasy ariary. 

You can apply for an extension of up to 90 days but this needs to be done through the immigration service.

Make sure your passport is stamped when passing through immigration. Take care not to overstay your visa otherwise you may be detained or deported.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. You should contact the Consulate-General of Madagascar or nearest embassy for the latest details.

#### Border measures

If you’re arriving from a country affected by cholera, you'll need to undertake additional sanitary controls and could be asked to take anti-cholera medication.

You may be offered alternative medication if you:

* are pregnant
* are under 8 years old
* have a pre-existing medical condition.

You may also need to provide contact details so health authorities can follow up for 3 – 5 days.

If you arrive from a country where yellow fever is widespread, you’ll need to provide proof of vaccination to enter Madagascar.

You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty on arrival.

#### Foreign currency

If you travel to Madagascar with foreign currency that you intend to take out of the country, you must declare this to customs on arrival. You can't leave Madagascar with more than 10,000 euros. For amounts over 1,000 euros, you’ll need to show bank receipts.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/). 

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us)
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx)

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Malagasy Ariary (MGA) but euros are widely accepted.

Madagascar has a cash-based economy. Credit cards aren't widely used, although some credit cards are accepted at major hotels, some restaurants and shops. 

You can make cash withdrawals from a limited number of ATMs in Antananarivo. Ask your bank if your cards will work in Madagascar.

There is a shortage of foreign currency in Madagascar so banks will not easily reconvert local currency to foreign currency.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

The standard of roads in Madagascar can be poor. Common hazards include:

* poorly maintained roads and vehicles
* poor or insufficient street lighting
* people and animals roaming on roads.

Following severe cyclones and weather events in 2024, road networks in some regions have been damaged. If you’re planning to drive check your route is still open. 

Carjacking, armed robberies and other crimes are a high risk when travelling by road. Be especially vigilant when travelling on National Routes and avoid driving at night (see '[Safety').](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/madagascar#safety)

#### Driver’s licence

You can drive in Madagascar with a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) for stays shorter than 90 days. For longer stays you’ll need to apply for an International Driver’s Permit from Australia.

The minimum driving age in Madagascar is 18 years old.

If you plan on driving in Madagascar:

* check your insurance covers driving
* check local traffic laws and practices
* be aware of potential dangers on the roads
* avoid remote roads, particularly at night
* drive carefully and legally
* don't drink and drive
* carry photo identity and vehicle registration documents, as you may be stopped by police.

#### Motorcycles

There is a high risk of motorcycle accidents in Madagascar, due to the poor state of roads. Avoid riding motorcycles, especially at night. 

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety)

#### Taxis and hired vehicles

Avoid taxis, as these are regularly attacked by armed robbers. This is especially the case for taxi bes (urban minibuses) and taxi brousses (rural minibuses).

Only use hired cars (or limousines) with drivers from recommended providers with a good reputation. 

#### Public transport

Public transport is not reliable and vehicles are not well maintained. Serious accidents have occurred. Avoid public transport due to the lack of safety and risk of crime.

#### Sea travel

Boat travel may be dangerous.

[Piracy](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/piracy)occurs in the coastal areas of northern Madagascar. Reduce the risk of piracy by adjusting your route if required, and monitoring piracy reports from the [International Maritime Bureau](https://www.icc-ccs.org/icc/imb).

Several ferries and rivercraft operate in Madagascar. These may be overloaded, poorly maintained and lack life-saving equipment. A lack of navigation skills and unexpected storms have contributed to boating accidents. 

To stay safe on water:

* check safety standards are in place
* check there is enough safety equipment for everyone
* wear your life jacket
* avoid travelling after dark
* don't get on overcrowded boats.
