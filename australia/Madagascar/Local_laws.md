# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Drug offences are serious. Punishments can be severe and prison conditions are harsh.

#### Other laws

Always carry photo ID, such as a passport or driver's licence. Police may ask you for it, especially if you're out late at night.

In Madagascar, it's illegal to:

* take photos of military installations or airports
* wear military-style clothing
* export protected plants or animals without approval
* export gemstones or vanilla for a commercial purpose without a permit.

Paying for sex is illegal. Fines range between 1500 and 7000 euros or prison sentences up to 10 years. Strict laws have been implemented against sexual abuse of children 17 years old and under, especially if foreigners are involved. Some underage sex workers may carry fake IDs, putting you at risk of prosecution or blackmail.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local Customs

In Madagascar, “fady” are strict traditional taboos. They dictate what is forbidden in daily life and can include food and clothing. Breaking them can lead to serious consequences. The fady are especially observed in rural areas of the country. 

Before travelling to rural or remote areas, seek advice from your tour operator or local guide about what the local practices, such as standards of dress and behaviour, especially on traditional sites. If you plan to stay longer in a village you may need to inform the local authority or village head.

#### LGBTQIA+ Travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal for people over 21 but same-sex marriage isn't recognised. Same sex relationships are not widely accepted in Madagascar. Avoid public displays of affection.

There are no anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQIA+ travellers.
