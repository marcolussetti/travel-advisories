#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care or repatriation. (see 'Medical care' below)

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away (including stopovers on the way to your destination)

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Australia on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Madagascar. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

There is a high exposure risk to diseases in Madagascar. Serious outbreaks of insect-borne and other infectious diseases occur. Consult your travel doctor for the latest vaccine recommendations at least 8 weeks before you leave.

#### Insect-borne diseases

Malaria is widespread in Madagascar, particularly during the wet season from October to May, but may can occur anytime. 

Outbreaks of bubonic plague also happen regularly. This can be treated with antibiotics, but it is crucial to seek medical treatment immediately if you experience any plague signs or symptoms.

Other insect-borne diseases include:

* [Dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection)
* [Chikungunya](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/chikungunya-virus)
* [Rift Valley Fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rift-valley-fever)
* [Filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis) ([elephantiasis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/elephantiasis)).

To protect yourself from insect-borne diseases:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing.

If you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or a bad headache, seek medical advice.

#### Other health risks

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids)is widespread. Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the risk of infection. [Polio](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/polio) is still present in Madagascar. Check your vaccination status for polio – you may need a booster even if you have been vaccinated in the past. Outbreaks of waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hepatitis)
* [schistosomiasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)

* [rabies](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19)
* [measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles)

To protect yourself from illness:

* wash and sanitise your hands regularly
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals.

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away. Seek medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

All hospitals require payments (public and private, costs differ). 

* Patients need to present their ID for admission.
* Government hospitals require patients’ families to bring all necessities – including food and linens. This is not so in private hospitals, although fees are much higher in private hospitals.

The standard of medical facilities in Madagascar is basic and extremely limited in rural areas. Regular outbreaks of diseases and natural disasters impact healthcare services and hospital capacity, including ambulance services and accident and emergency care.

There are some public and private hospitals in Antananarivo, but only routine medical operations are possible. You'll need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be expensive.

All hospitals require payment up front. Most travellers attend private clinics which can be expensive. In public hospitals you’ll need to provide your own necessities – including food and linen. 

You’ll need provide ID for admission. Only some doctors speak English.

There's no shared healthcare agreement between Australia and Madagascar. Check your insurance covers hospital stays and medical evacuation.

There are no decompression chambers in Madagascar. If you're scuba diving:

* dive within safety limits
* check your insurance policy covers diving and medical evacuation
