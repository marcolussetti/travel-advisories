# Safety

#### Crime

Crime, including violent crime, is a serious issue in Madagascar.

Petty crimes, such as bag-snatching and pickpocketing are common, particularly in urban and crowded areas such as markets. Foreigners have also been the target of muggings and theft.

To protect yourself:

* be vigilant in tourist and transport locations
* don't go out alone after dark especially on foot
* don't leave luggage and valuables unattended
* don't display cash or valuables
* always keep your vehicle and accommodation locked

If you're attacked or robbed, don't resist. Criminals could be armed.

Report crimes to local police noting that resources are stretched, and you may not get the level of service you would in Australia, especially for petty crimes.

#### Regional crime

There have been reports of violent clashes and crimes, resulting in deaths, across various regions of Madagascar. This includes:

* Northern Madagascar: in the beach and crowded areas of Nosy Be, Ankify Port and Ambanja
* Western Madagascar: on National Routes around Besalampy, Morombe, Tsiroanomandidy and Maintirano
* Southern Madagascar: in the Southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara and Fort-Dauphin

Before travelling to regional or remote areas:

* seek local security advice
* use a recognised tour operator or official local guide
* avoid travelling at night especially if travelling by road
* don't visit beaches or national parks alone

#### Carjacking

'Smash and grab' thefts from vehicles and carjacking are common. This includes taxi bes (urban minibuses), taxi brousses (rural minibuses), and river ferries. This is particularly prevalent:

* on national routes
* at major intersections
* during traffic congestion
* after dark

To prevent theft when travelling by car:

* keep doors locked and windows up especially in Antananarivo
* keep valuables out of sight
* avoid driving after dark
* use registered tour operators or ask your hotel to arrange transport

If you’re stopped by security personnel or police, politely ask for identification. There have previously been reports of criminals posing as police.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Protests related to political or economic conditions occur regularly, particularly in periods near election.

Protests and events that attract large numbers of people can sometimes turn violent with little or no warning. Security forces may respond with force. Roads may be closed.

Violent incidents have been reported in the past in Antananarivo, around government buildings, the national stadium, historical monuments, and military installations.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid demonstrations and other large public gatherings
* monitor local news
* follow the instructions of local authorities.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping for ransom is a risk in Madagascar. Foreigners have been targeted.

Always be alert to your personal security and surroundings and check your accommodation has appropriate security measures.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Madagascar experiences [natural disasters](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident), including [cyclones](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) and [tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters).

If there's a severe weather event:

* you may get stuck where you are
* flights could be delayed, suspended or fill quickly
* seaports could close
* safe shelter may not be available
* medical facilities may be limited

Consider weather conditions when planning your travel and stay up-to-date with weather forecasts and natural disaster warnings before and during your stay. 

If a natural disaster or weather event occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor local weather and news reports
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep friends and family up to date on your safety

#### Cyclones and storms

The cyclone season is from November to April. However, storms and cyclones may occur at other times. The direction and strength of cyclones can change without warning. Coastal areas are most at risk. 

Storms and cyclones can cause:

* flash flooding
* torrential rain
* storm surges
* winds up to 300km/h
* landslides/mudslides

Cyclones can cause damage to buildings, roads, bridges and communication services across Madagascar. This includes in the capital, Antananarivo. 

To prepare for a cyclone or storm:

* know the evacuation plan for your hotel, cruise ship, or other accommodation
* identify your local shelter
* follow the instructions of local authorities

#### Tsunamis

Tsunamis can occur in Madagascar. These are caused by an undersea earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption and can arrive within minutes. They can also occur if no earthquake is felt.

Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive tsunami alerts.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards.  
If you plan to do a tour or adventure activity:

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Swimming safety

Avoid visiting isolated beaches, especially if you are alone. Seek local advice or use an experienced travel operator when visiting coastal areas. Don’t swim in freshwater as the risk of waterborne and infectious diseases is high.

If you plan to spend time in or on the water:

* check weather reports or seek local information about weather conditions and potential dangers
* take warnings seriously
* speak to your travel provider about safety equipment
* ensure you have travel insurance and that your policy covers your planned activities
