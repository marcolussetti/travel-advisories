Latest update

Ecuador is in a state of 'internal armed conflict' due to crime. A separate state of emergency is in effect in several provinces, and some districts are under curfew. The situation may change at short notice. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities (see 'Safety'). Do not travel within 20km of the border with Colombia, except the official border crossing at Tulcan, due to the high risk of kidnapping and violent crime associated with drug-related criminal organisations.

## Overview

### Safety

* A state of emergency was renewed on 3 March for the provinces of Guayas, El Oro, Santa Elena, Manabí, Orellana, Sucumbios, Los Ríos, Quito Metropolitan District (Pichincha province), and Camilo Ponce Enríquez district (Azuay province). The military and police can seize assets, conduct inspections and enter private properties without permission during this time.
* There are curfews in some districts (‘cantons’) of the above provinces. The situation may change at short notice. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities. Ecuador has declared a nation-wide state of "internal armed conflict" due to crime and military efforts to combat it.
* There's a high risk of kidnapping and violent crime in the northern regions and Guayaquil City. Areas bordering Colombia and Peru are particularly dangerous. Do not travel within 20km of the border with Colombia except at the official border crossing at Tulcan. If, despite our advice, you're travelling to these areas, seek professional security advice. Be alert to possible threats.
* Demonstrations occur frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Political activity by foreigners is illegal, including joining protests. If you take part, officials may detain or deport you. Avoid large public gatherings.
* Violent crime and theft are common. The risk of violent crime increases when you travel alone or after dark. Criminals target taxis, buses, transport hubs and crowded areas. Thieves target travellers, and distraction is a common tactic. Female travellers are encouraged to take particular caution. Be careful when using ATMs and credit cards. Avoid going out at night. Keep vehicle doors and windows locked and valuables out of sight, even when moving.
* Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. See our advice on [partying safely while overseas](/before-you-go/safety/partying "Partying safely").
* Power outages and water shortages may occur at various locations. Check for updates from local providers and local media.
* There are several active volcanos in Ecuador. Seek updates and follow the advice of the local government.

### Health

* Many parts of Ecuador are at high altitudes. You can develop altitude sickness above 2500m. If you're travelling to these areas, consult your doctor before you leave. Ensure your travel insurance covers emergency evacuation from altitude and related medical costs.
* Yellow fever is common. Get vaccinated before you travel.
* In areas below 1500m, there's a risk of other insect-borne diseases. These include malaria and dengue. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malaria medication.
* Zika virus is widespread. If you're pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your doctor before you leave. HIV/AIDS is common. Take precautions before doing anything that puts you at risk of infection.

### Travel

* Due to the declaration of a state of "internal armed conflict", when entering via land or river borders from Peru or Colombia, you must present an apostilled police check in Spanish covering the previous five years. Minors, diplomats, and people already holding valid visas for Ecuador are exempt. Alternatively, tourists without a police check can ask immigration authorities to do a background check on their immigration system at the border.
* You can stay in Ecuador for up to 90 days without a visa. If you want to stay longer, you'll need a visa. If you overstay, you may be fined and barred from future visits.
* Unmarked minefields are in the Cordillera del Condor region near the Peruvian border. Seek local advice before travelling there.
