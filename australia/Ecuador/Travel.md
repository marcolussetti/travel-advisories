#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free short stays and visitor visas

You can stay in Ecuador for up to 90 days without a visa.

If you want to stay longer, you can pay to [request an extension](https://servicio.migracion.gob.ec/tramite/3) for up to 90 extra days (you can only do this once). Do this before the initial period expires. If you overstay without a visa, you may be fined and barred from future visits.

Visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. This includes currency, customs and quarantine rules. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Ecuador](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/60) and visit the [Ecuadorean Migration](https://www.migracion.gob.ec/) for details.

#### Travel to the Galapagos Islands

For visits other than tourism, you must get a visa or special permission from the local authority. You must do this before you arrive in Ecuador.

#### Travel via the United States

If you travel through the US, you must also meet US entry or transit requirements.

Check your visa requirements with an [embassy or consulate of the United States](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/212). Do this well before you travel.

#### Travel via Chile

If you’re travelling via Chile, ensure you meet all current entry or transit requirements.

#### Entry into Ecuador

Get your passport stamped on entry by land or sea. If it isn't stamped, you could face deportation or delays leaving Ecuador.

If you're entering by land from Colombia or Peru, you must get an entry stamp from an Ecuadorian official at the border. If you're on a shared bus, consider advising the driver that you need to get the stamp. Otherwise, the driver may not stop at the border, resulting in you not being in Ecuador legally. You'll need the exit stamp from the country you're entering Ecuador from. 

When entering via land or river borders from Peru or Colombia, you're required to present an [apostilled police check](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/notarial-services/documents-overseas) in Spanish or an official Spanish translation covering the previous 5 years. Minors, diplomats, and people already holding valid visas in Ecuador are exempt from providing this police check. You can also request Ecuadorian immigration authorities to do a background check on their immigration system (which flags any travel prohibitions or INTERPOL alerts) at the point of entry.

#### Travel to the Galapagos Islands

The [Governing Council of the Special Regime of Galapagos](https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/) requires foreign tourists to meet particular criteria, including filling out the [Galapagos Transit Control Card](https://siiws.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/siicgg_web/) at least 24 hours before entering, having an outbound flight, and travel insurance. You may be requested to show your hotel booking. See the articles in '[Ingreso a Galápagos](https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/ingreso-a-galapagos/)', including the '[Para ingresar](https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/para-ingresar-a-la-provincia-de-galapagos/)' (to enter), '[Al arribar](https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/al-arribar-a-la-provincia/)' (on arrival), and its [FAQ](https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/preguntas-y-respuestas-frecuentes-control-migratorio-tct/).

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You'll need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Ecuador if you have spent more than 10 days in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia or Peru, or travelling from endemic countries such as the Dominican Republic, Congo and Uganda. Limited exemptions may exist, however, you should contact an [embassy or consulate of Ecuador](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/60) to confirm current requirements regarding your specific circumstances. Some airlines may want to see the certificate before departure to Ecuador.

#### Travelling with children

Children younger than 18 who travel alone or with 1 parent may need to present:

* a letter of consent from non-travelling parents
* a copy of their birth certificate

Both documents must be:

* translated into Spanish
* notarised by the [Embassy of Ecuador](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/60) in Australia

**More information:**

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The US Dollar is the legal currency of Ecuador.

It's useful to have $US1 notes. Many smaller shops and taxi drivers don't change large notes.

ATMs are available around the country.

Credit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants and tourist facilities in major centres. Contact your bank to check that your card will work.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Minefields are a danger in the Cordillera del Condor region near the Peruvian border. These minefields can be unmarked.

Seek local advice before you travel to the Cordillera del Condor region.

Take care when travelling off-road. Look out for landmines in:

* Zamora-Chinchipe
* Morona-Santiago
* El Oro

#### Tours

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes on adventure activities and in the Galapagos Islands. Accredited tourist transport vehicles are not subject to any mobility restriction.

If you plan to do a tour:

* get travel insurance before you go to the Galapagos Islands
* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Remote locations

If you're visiting eco-lodges or other remote locations in northern and eastern Ecuador, consider:

* the security arrangements in place
* the travel distance to hospital in the case of an emergency

Reputable eco-lodges have good security, communications and emergency plans.

#### Driving permit

For the first six months after you arrive in Ecuador you can drive with both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before departing Australia.

#### Road travel

Main roads are reasonable. Roads in rural areas aren't always well maintained.

Driving in Ecuador can be dangerous, particularly at night.

Hazards include:

* poorly maintained vehicles
* bad driving practices
* heavy rains
* mudslides
* heavy fog in mountainous areas

Ash from volcanic eruptions can clog and stall vehicle engines.

If you plan to drive in Ecuador:

* check you have the right insurance cover
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* be cautious if driving after a volcano has erupted
* seek local advice
* monitor local media and other sources for updates on road conditions
* pay attention to your safety and security

**More information:**

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

Your travel insurance may not cover you when riding a motorbike, quad bike or similar.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

All registered taxis have a panic button and security cameras installed.

Express kidnappings often involve unregistered taxis.

Only use authorised taxis with:

* a taxi registration sticker
* security cameras
* panic buttons
* orange licence plates
* orange and white registration numbers

Ask your hotel to arrange a radio-dispatched taxi.

#### Public transport

Bus accidents are common.

Violent crime occurs on:

* city buses
* long-distance buses
* international buses

Armed criminals board buses to rob passengers.

If you plan to use public transport:

* avoid travel by bus
* if you must travel by bus, use a direct route without stops
* don't store anything under your seat or overhead

**More information:**

* [Transport and getting around safely](/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport "Public transport")

#### Boat travel

Safety standards of boats vary.

[Piracy](/node/358) occurs along the coast of Ecuador.

Strikes and disturbances by local fishermen in the Galapagos Islands can disrupt travel.

Get your tour operator to confirm in writing that the boat you'll travel on:

* has certification by the Ecuadorian Navy
* meets the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention standards

Check [piracy reports](https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre) issued by the International Maritime Bureau.
