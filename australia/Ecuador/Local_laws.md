# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison terms in local jails.

Minimum sentence for trafficking or consuming 'soft drugs', such as marijuana (cannabis), can be 1 to 2 years in jail.

#### Proof of identity

You must always carry photo identification in Ecuador. Authorities may detain you if you don't.

#### Other laws

Political activity by foreigners is illegal. This includes joining protests or demonstrations.

If you participate, authorities may detain or deport you.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
