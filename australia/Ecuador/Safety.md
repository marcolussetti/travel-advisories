#### Civil unrest and political tension

Civil unrest could occur due to political tensions. During unrests, there is increased military and police presence. Curfews may be imposed. Carry your ID at all times and follow the instructions of local authorities. The government may announce a state of emergency at any time.

The security situation could deteriorate with little notice. 

You should be extra vigilant. Avoid demonstrations. Monitor local media and follow official government instructions.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations occur frequently. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. In 2022, there were several violent protests which resulted in a strong government response, including curfews.

Demonstrations and protests can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. You should:

* avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place
* follow the instructions of local authorities
* monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations
* check for updates on the [Communicacion Ecuador](https://twitter.com/ComunicacionEc) X (formerly Twitter) page

Political activity by foreigners is illegal. This includes joining protests or demonstrations. If you take part, authorities may detain or deport you.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest you should:

* remain vigilant
* stay informed by monitoring reputable local and international media
* avoid trouble areas
* maintain contact with family and friends in Australia
* obey instructions from local authorities
* avoid all protests.

If you're affected by demonstrations and roadblocks, follow the [MinTur (Ministry of Tourism) social media channels](https://twitter.com/turismoec), or for information about the state of the roads, see [Consulta de vias](https://www.ecu911.gob.ec/consulta-de-vias/) (Spanish).

#### Provision of food or supplies

If you can't go out safely and don't have access to food and/or supplies, consider using a reputable delivery app.

#### Crime

In January 2024, Ecuador declared a nationwide state of "internal armed conflict" in response to the rise in crime and gang violence across the country. This state enables an increased military and police presence.

The security situation may change at short notice. Check for updates from Ecuadorian authorities.

There is a separate state of emergency in place affecting the provinces of Guayas, Los Ríos, Manabí, Orellana, Santa Elena, El Oro, Sucumbíos, Azuay (Ponce Enríquez canton), and Pichincha (the Metropolitan District of Quito). In several cantons within the above provinces, there is a curfew from 10pm to 5am. Check with local authorities for more information on restrictions in place.

During a state of emergency, police and military can:

* restrict freedom of movement and the right to assembly and association
* monitor correspondence and communications
* enter private properties to conduct searches
* impose curfews with short notice, and travel disruptions may occur.

If you're a victim of a crime, you can:

* Call 911 or the crime emergency line 1800-DELITO (335486) for direct assistance,
* Report the incident using Ecuador Attorney General's Office (Fiscalía General) [online reporting tool](https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncias-en-linea-para-turistas/) (listed under 'Denuncias online para turistas').
* Complain to Ecuador's Ministry of Tourism via e-mail to [denuncias@turismo.gob.ec](mailto:denuncias@turismo.gob.ec).

#### Violent crime

Violent crime and theft are common. This includes:

* [assault](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault")
* armed robbery
* [kidnapping](/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping "Reducing the risk of kidnapping")
* car break-ins

Female travellers are encouraged to take particular caution.

Travellers have reported serious assaults and theft in Quito at:

* El Panecillo
* La Mariscal
* Guapulo
* the old town
* southern Quito

Outside Quito, thieves target travellers at:

* Guayaquil's downtown, waterfront and market areas
* Cerro Mandango near Vilcabamba Loja
* the Antennas of Pichincha
* Lower Rio Napo's jungle lodges
* Cuyabeno National Reserve areas

Some riverboat tours have been robbed at gunpoint, with passengers left stranded.

#### Petty crime

Thieves target [backpackers](/before-you-go/activities/backpacking "Going overseas to backpack") and foreigners for bag-snatching and pickpocketing, even in large tour groups. Travellers have been injured when they resist.

Petty crime is common around Quito at:

* La Mariscal
* La Marin
* La Carolina and El Ejido parks

Theft also occurs:

* after using an ATM or leaving a bank
* through credit card fraud and card skimming

Thieves working in pairs or groups use distraction methods, such as:

* staged fights
* asking for help
* pushing or shoving

To protect yourself from petty crime:

* don't leave your luggage, food or drinks unattended
* be alert when using ATM and credit cards
* don't let your credit or debit card out of your sight

#### Spiking assaults

Travellers have been robbed and sexually assaulted after accepting 'spiked' drinks and food, as well as chewing gum and cigarettes.

Spikers use drugs, such as scopolamine, including through aerosol sprays and paper handouts, to incapacitate, rob and assault their victims.

Never accept things from strangers or people you have just met.

#### Road-based crime

Risk of violent crime increases when you travel alone or after dark.

Violent crime and theft occur in:

* airports
* city, long-distance and international buses
* taxis
* transport terminals
* internet cafes
* public markets and crowded streets

Armed criminals have boarded buses to rob passengers.

North of Quito, high risk security situations can develop quickly. Dangerous areas include Ecuador's borders with Colombia and Peru in:

* Sucumbíos province
* Esmeraldas province

Armed groups and other criminals engage in kidnapping and other violent criminal activity. Foreigners have been kidnapped in these regions, including in Cuyabeno wildlife reserve.

If you plan to travel there, check warnings issued by local authorities.

The official border crossing town of Tulcán in Carchi province is in a high-risk area but is usually safer than its surrounds.

To protect yourself from crime:

* pay attention to your safety and security
* keep doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* secure your accommodation against intruders
* avoid going out alone, especially at night
* if camping, only stay at authorised campsites

#### Scams and fraud

Ayahuasca tourism is a growing industry in Ecuador and Peru. It involves shamans guiding visitors through psychedelic rituals, often referred to as 'spiritual cleansing'.

It's not illegal, but serious assaults and robbery can occur. Victims report a range of experiences, from being alert but unable to maintain control of their surroundings, to total amnesia.

Credit card fraud and debit card [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers") are increasing.

To reduce your risk of scams:

* research ayahuasca tour operators before you sign up
* avoid participating in ayahuasca rituals without a trusted friend present
* always keep your debit and credit cards in sight

#### Electricity and water shortages

Power outages and water shortages may occur at any time. In 2024, nationwide power outages occurred. The duration and frequency differed by location. There was also water rationing, which caused water shortages in some parts of the country. 

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking and methanol poisioning

Be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks. 

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartraveller.gov.au%2Fwhile-youre-away%2Fwhen-things-go-wrong%2Fmedical-assistance&data=05%7C02%7Ctravel.advice%40dfat.gov.au%7C1a6539ec3139433d955108dd0ce9c732%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C638680920391958681%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=EsUEa5rTBa0jz1cqQs89Egd9uR6xkZq8llmMqOeo7t0%3D&reserved=0) could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping rates increased in Ecuador in 2024, amid a wider deterioration of the security environment. Kidnaps are usually conducted by financially motivated criminals and tend to last less than a week. Kidnapping gangs have been reported to operate in north-western provinces. Kidnappings have occurred along the northern border with Colombia, with some targeting foreigners.

There is a risk of express kidnappings in Ecuador. Businesspeople and visitors perceived to be wealthy may be targeted by kidnappers in search of payouts.

Kidnappings for ransom happen, including in:

* major cities, such as Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca
* Sucumbios
* Esmeraldas, including San Lorenzo
* Cuyabeno wildlife reserve
* areas within 20km of the border with Colombia
* places frequented by foreigners

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Ecuador can experience [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") and [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster"), such as:

* flooding and landslides
* [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [volcanic eruptions](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [tsunamis](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [bushfires](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters#bushfires)

If a natural disaster occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with your family and friends

**More information:**

* Ecuador's [Risk Management Secretariat](https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/)

#### Flooding and landslides

Rainy seasons are from:

* December to May in the coastal region
* May to November in El Oriente, east of the Andes

Heavy rain often results in landslides and mudslides. Unseasonable rain can cause flooding outside these times.

#### Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

Ecuador is located in a seismic zone. All parts of Ecuador, including the Galapagos Islands, can experience earthquakes. They can affect the country's infrastructure and connectivity. Depending on where it occurs, an earthquake could initiate a tsunami.

Be sure to follow the instructions of local authorities in case of an emergency.

Several volcanoes in Ecuador are active, including:

* El Reventador, 95km east of Quito
* Guagua Pichincha, 11km west of Quito
* Cotopaxi, 50km south of Quito
* Sangay, 40km south-east of Rio Bamba
* Tungurahua, overlooking the tourist town of Baños, 135km south of Quito

Eruptions can occur at any time and without warning.

If you're in an area prone to volcanic eruption, ensure you know the evacuation procedures and routes.

Falling ash following an eruption can spread over a wide area and can affect air travel.

Exposure to ash, dust and toxic fumes after a volcanic eruption is a major health risk. This is especially the case for those with existing breathing problems.

Before you travel to any areas prone to volcanic activity:

* monitor local media
* check with local authorities for information on volcanic activity

To protect yourself if there's a volcanic eruption:

* stay inside with the windows and doors shut
* place damp towels at door thresholds and other draft sources if ash is falling in your area
* wear a disposable face mask and change it frequently if you need to go outside
* wear long-sleeved clothing, long pants and goggles
* avoid contact with ash

#### Tsunamis

Ecuador is at risk of tsunamis. A tsunami can arrive very soon after a nearby tremor or earthquake.

Be alert. Don't wait for official warnings.

Move immediately to high ground if advised by local authorities or if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Once on high ground, monitor local media and weather services.
