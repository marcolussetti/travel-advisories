## Overview

### Safety

* Petty crime is common, including in urban centres. This includes pickpocketing, bag-snatching and car break-ins. Don’t leave valuables in your car. Always keep vehicle doors locked and windows up, even when moving.
* Violent crime includes muggings and robberies. Tourists have been robbed after stopping for hitchhikers or to help people. Avoid walking alone in large towns, particularly at night. Don’t offer strangers lifts in your vehicle.
* Taxi drivers have robbed travellers. Don’t hail unmarked taxis on the street. Use taxis with the Namibia Bus and Taxi Association logo. Book taxis through your hotel or a taxi company.
* Credit card skimming occurs. Always keep your card in sight. Check your statements often for fraudulent transactions.
* Drink spiking happens. Don't accept food, drink, cigarettes or gum from strangers. Don’t leave your food or drinks unattended.
* Flooding may happen in the rainy season from November to April. Floods can block roads. Follow local advice.

### Health

* There's currently a cholera outbreak in the Kunene Region. Take precautions with food and water.
* Anyone over 9 months old and travelling from a country where yellow fever is widespread must present a yellow fever vaccination certificate on arrival. Get vaccinated before you travel.
* The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is high. Take precautions if you engage in high-risk activities.
* Malaria is common in northern Namibia. Consider taking anti-malarial medication and other preventative measures if you’re travelling to this area. Other insect-borne diseases include leishmaniasis. Use insect repellent and ensure your accommodation is insect-proof.
* Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases are common. They include typhoid, hepatitis and meningitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities and services are limited outside major urban centres. If you're seriously ill or injured, you may need evacuation, probably to South Africa. Ensure your travel insurance covers this. Medical evacuation is expensive and hard to organise.
