#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need to apply for a [visa on arrival](https://eservices.mhaiss.gov.na/visaonarrival) in Namibia or submit an online application prior to travel. Fees apply. Visas are valid for 3 months from the date of issue.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact a [consulate-general of Namibia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Consulates/139/State) or [the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration](https://mha.gov.na/) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Make sure the correct visa and entry period is stamped in your passport, even if you're transiting.

Check your visa before leaving the immigration counter.

You may be detained or fined if you don't follow visa or immigration requirements.

#### Passport

To enter Namibia, you'll need one blank page in your passport. If you're travelling from Namibia to South Africa, you'll need another two blank pages.

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Namibian Dollar (NAD).

You can also use South African rand (ZAR).

Declare amounts more than NAD50,000 when you arrive and leave Namibia. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

In major centres, credit cards are accepted and ATMs are available. This may not be the case in remote areas. Ask your bank if your ATM card will work in Namibia.

#### Local travel

#### Landmines

Unexploded landmines and remnants of war are a danger in the northern regions bordering Angola.

Use main routes in these regions and follow the advice of the local authorities.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Namibia, you need a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted).

Though not mandatory you may be requested to show a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must obtain your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous in Namibia.

Hazards include:

* poor local driving practices
* poor street lighting
* poorly maintained vehicles
* pedestrians, wild animals and livestock on roads

Roads between main urban centres are good, but they're usually unsealed in rural areas.

Gravel and sandy roads, flash flooding and water-damaged roads are driving hazards.

Tourists have had accidents because they were driving too fast on unfamiliar roads.

Most vehicle insurance policies only cover accidents involving other vehicles or animals.

Check your insurance policy covers you for accidents on unsealed roads and single-vehicle accidents.

To reduce your risks while driving:

* check local traffic laws and practices
* be aware of animals and pedestrians on roads
* travel with sufficient fuel, water and emergency provisions in desert areas
* follow speed limits

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when using a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use registered taxis, preferably arranged through your hotel.

To protect yourself if you need to take a taxi:

* avoid hailing taxis on the street
* don't share taxis with strangers
* always sit in the back seat

#### Public transport

Avoid public transport where possible.

Vehicles are often poorly maintained.

Local buses don't always follow permanent routes.

Alternative options for transport are ride-hailing apps such as Yango and Lefa.

#### Air travel

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Namibia's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=V5) with the Aviation Safety Network.
