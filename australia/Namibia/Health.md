#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Some Namibian medical and emergency facilities don't recognise all travel insurance policies. Ask your insurer if their product is recognised in Namibia before you buy it.

Carry a copy of the policy and your insurer's emergency phone number.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Namibia. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection in Namibia is high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to a risk of infection.

#### Insect-borne diseases

If you're travelling from a country where [yellow fever](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/travel-and-health/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission.pdf?sfvrsn=bf42ac59_1&download=true) is widespread, you'll need a valid yellow fever certificate to enter Namibia. This does not apply to a child aged under 9 months. If you can't show proof of vaccination, authorities may not let you enter Namibia. You can't get vaccinated on arrival.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is common in northern Namibia.

Other insect-borne diseases include:

* [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis)
* [leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### Cholera

[Cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) mainly occurs in rural areas. More serious outbreaks can happen from time to time.

To protect yourself against cholera:

* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* be strict with your hygiene habits, especially if you travel in rural areas
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids

Tap water in major cities is generally safe to drink.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") are common. These include:

* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/typhoid/en/)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19?language=und)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in fresh water
* always check with local authorities before swimming in waters
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, seek medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited outside major urban centres.

Private hospitals in major urban centres are better equipped.

You'll need to pay cash before doctors and hospitals will treat you. Your insurer may be able to repay you later if you're covered.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to South Africa or another place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
