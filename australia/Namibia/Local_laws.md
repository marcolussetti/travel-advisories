# Local laws

#### Laws

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're detained or arrested, Namibian authorities may not contact the Australian Government straight away.

Ask officials to call the Australian High Commission in South Africa, or the Australian Consulate in Windhoek.

Police resources are varied throughout Namibia.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long jail sentences.

Penalties are severe for illegal trading in diamonds and precious stones. Only buy diamonds and precious stones from licensed shops.
