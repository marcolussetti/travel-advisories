## Overview

### Safety

* Do not cross into Ukraine from Poland. Special conditions may apply when entering Poland by road from Ukraine.
* Be careful of drink spiking. Keep an eye on your food and drink.
* Be careful when crossing the road. Use pedestrian crossings only, and make sure cars have stopped before crossing.
* There have been reports of violence against LGBTQIA+ people. Avoid public displays of affection to avoid any possible confrontation or discrimination.

### Health

* Air pollution levels can be very high in winter. Get medical advice if you have a heart or lung condition.
* Public hospitals are reasonable in large cities. Services are limited in rural and border regions.
* Most doctors and hospitals will need payment up-front or evidence of medical insurance before treating you. Don't assume you're covered for medical costs if you're a dual citizen. Check with the [Polish Social Insurance (ZUS)](http://www.zus.pl/).

### Local laws

* There are strict alcohol laws in Poland. There's zero tolerance for drink driving. The blood alcohol limit is 0.02%. It's illegal to drink or be drunk in public. You may be arrested or taken to a facility to sober up.
* It's illegal to take photos of some buildings. Look for signs on buildings that forbid photos and check with local authorities.
* Poland doesn't recognise dual nationality. This may limit the consular help we can provide. By Polish law, dual nationals must enter and exit Poland on their Polish passport.

### Travel

* Poland is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter without a visa in some cases. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest embassy or consulate of Poland for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.
* The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.
* Temporary border checks at all German land borders will be in place from 16 September for 6 months. The existing checks at Germany's borders with Austria, Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic will be extended, and the periods will be aligned.
* You can't enter Poland via the land borders from Belarus and Russia (Kaliningrad).
* Be cautious if travelling in regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Access is restricted up to 2km from the border in some areas.
* If you're travelling by land, you must have a valid Australian passport.
