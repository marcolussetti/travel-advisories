#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Poland. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Air pollution

Air pollution levels can be very high.

Get medical advice if you have a pre-existing heart or lung condition.

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) is a risk.

Ticks are common in both urban and country areas. They're active year-round, especially from spring to autumn.

Regularly check your body for ticks during and after visits to parks, gardens and forest areas.

If a tick bites you:

* remove it from your body as soon as possible
* make sure you remove the whole tick
* monitor the site for any signs of infection

#### Measles

Measles cases can routinely occur in Poland, which is currently experiencing increased measles activity. Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before you travel.

#### Medical care

Public hospitals are of a reasonable standard in large cities. Services are limited in rural and border regions.

Most doctors and hospitals will need payment up-front or evidence of medical insurance before treating you, even in an emergency. Don't presume you're covered for medical costs if you're a dual citizen. Check with the [Polish Social Insurance (ZUS)](http://www.zus.pl/).

If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
