#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

Poland is part of the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), meaning you can enter without a visa in some cases.

In other situations, such as working, studying or staying long-term, you'll need a visa.

Border officials may ask you to show them an onward ticket.

Carry your passport when crossing borders, including within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Poland](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/162) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Ensure that you meet all entry and exit conditions.

#### Border measures

You can't enter Poland via the land borders from Belarus and Russia (Kaliningrad).

Since 16 September, temporary border checks at all German land borders are in place for 6 months. The existing checks at Germany's borders with Austria, Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic will be extended, and the periods will be aligned.

#### European Entry/Exit System (EES)

The new [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees_en) for all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen Area has been delayed until later in 2025. A specific start date hasn't been announced.

The EES is a digital border system that registers non-EU visitors travelling into the Schengen Area. When entering the Schengen Area, you'll need to have your fingerprints and photo taken. This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details. Passports will no longer be stamped.

You'll need to do this on your first visit to the EU after the EES is introduced.​ If you visit the Schengen Area again within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

This process should only take a few minutes per person, however you may experience longer queues at borders when the new system starts.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate of Poland](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/162) for the latest details on entry requirements before you travel.

#### Other formalities

If you're staying in private accommodation, you must register with the local registration office.

You'll need proof of registration if you apply for a visa extension.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You could end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Poland's currency is the Zloty (PLN).

You can easily change all major currencies.

If you're travelling between Poland and any non-EU country, declare currency equivalent to 10,000 euro or more. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You'll be fined if you don't declare currency or give incorrect information.

You should check with local authorities in the countries you are leaving, entering or passing through whether you must declare higher amounts of currency.

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen area](/before-you-go/the-basics/schengen "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), and be prepared to show it to authorities at any time.

If you travel by road or train, allow extra time for disruptions or delays.

Be cautious while travelling in regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Access is restricted up to 2km from the border in some areas. Abide by any regulations at all times and follow the advice of the [Polish authorities.](https://www.strazgraniczna.pl/)

#### Border with Belarus and Russia (Kaliningrad)

Do not cross into Belarus or Russia from Poland.

Read the travel advice for [Belarus](/destinations/europe/belarus "Belarus") and [Russia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/russia).

You can't enter Poland via the land borders from Belarus or Russia (Kaliningrad) – limited exceptions may apply.

#### Border with Ukraine

Do not travel from Poland to Ukraine.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. Heavy fighting is occurring in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Missile strikes and attacks are ongoing in some locations across the country, including in major cities. Exercise caution while travelling in the regions bordering Ukraine. The security situation continues to be volatile. 

If, despite our advice, you travel by road from Ukraine to Poland, you may face additional security measures when crossing the border. See 'Safety' section above and the [Ukraine travel advice](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/ukraine) for more information.

#### Driving permit

You can drive in Poland for 6 months if you have both:

* an International Driving Permit (IDP), and
* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver’s licences may not be accepted)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

You must get a Polish licence if you want to drive for longer than 6 months. Ensure your driver's licence is current.

#### Road travel

There is a high rate of motor vehicle accidents in Poland. The main causes of accidents are failure to give way, speeding and drink driving.

Stay below the legal blood alcohol limit of 0.02%.

Hazards for drivers and pedestrians include:

* driving at high speed
* pedestrians looking in the wrong direction at crossings due to cars driving on the right-hand side in Europe
* be aware that when turning with a green arrow, pedestrians also have a green crossing light and have the right of way
* poor roads, especially outside major cities
* poor street lighting
* high volumes of traffic, particularly trucks

Many highways are not dual-carriageways or are under construction. Overtaking lanes are rare. 

Severe weather in winter can make driving more dangerous. Some roads are closed in winter.

If you drive in winter, use winter tyres and carry chains.

By law, you must always have your headlights on when driving.

Children shorter than 150cm must use a safety seat. Check with your car rental company or the police.

Using mobile phones while driving is prohibited unless they're fitted with a hands-free device.

Poland's road rules are different from Australia's. Know the rules to avoid fines and insurance issues.

Check the vehicle rental company rules before hiring a car or motorbike. You must meet both Polish and Australian vehicle operating and licence laws (e.g. hold the appropriate licence for the vehicle you drive).

#### Tolls

The process of paying road tolls varies across the country.

#### Taxis

Only use official taxis. They have the name and number of the taxi company on the door and on top of the taxi, next to the light. They'll also show a rate card on the vehicle window.

Taxis with a crest but no company name are not official taxis.

Unregulated taxis can overcharge passengers. There have been reports of attacks against passengers, including sexual assaults, in both unregulated taxis and cars booked using ride-sharing apps.

Pre-book taxis using a reputable taxi company or app with English language option. You can also ask staff at hotels, hostels or tourist areas to book you an official taxi.
