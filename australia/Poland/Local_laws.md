# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

When reporting a crime to the police, it's a requirement for a sworn 'approved' translator to be present regardless of how fluent the officer is in English. You may have to wait for a translator to arrive.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include mandatory prison sentences.

#### Drinking laws

There are strict alcohol laws in Poland. 

There's zero tolerance for drink driving. The blood alcohol limit is 0.02%.

If you drink and drive, you face up to five years in jail and substantial fines. Your car could also be impounded. Drink drivers involved in accidents face up to 16 years in jail and significant fines.

It's illegal to be drunk in public. You may be arrested or taken to a facility to sober up. Expect to pay for the cost of your stay.

Drinking alcohol in public places is illegal, including parks and picnic areas.

#### Surrogacy

Poland has no specific surrogacy laws in place. Seek independent legal advice. 

The Australian Embassy can't provide:

* legal advice about surrogacy
* information on clinics

#### Other laws

It's illegal to take photos of some buildings.

Look for signs on buildings that forbid photos. If you're not sure, check with local authorities.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Poland doesn't recognise dual nationality.

Under Polish law, Australian-Polish dual nationals must enter and exit Poland using their Polish passport or Polish national identity card (only within the Schengen zone). 

If you're a dual national, this may limit the terms of [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can provide if you're arrested or detained.
