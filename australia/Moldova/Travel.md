#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

If you're visiting for up to 90 days within a 6-month period, you won't need a visa.

For longer stays, you'll need a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Moldova](https://www.mfa.gov.md/en/advanced-page-type/misiuni-ale-republicii-moldova-strainatate), or visit the [Moldova Government](https://www.mfa.gov.md/en) website for the latest information. They'll tell you about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Record your entry date, and check your visa dates carefully. If you overstay your visa, authorities may deport you.

#### Entry to Moldova

You need to register at your port of entry.

Passport control authorities at border crossings automatically register your entry unless you're entering through Transnistria.

#### Travel through Transnistria

Do not enter or exit Moldova through Transnistria.

Several checkpoints exist along the routes into and out of Transnistria. These are not official border or immigration control points.

If you enter through Transnistria, your passport will not show a valid entry stamp. This may create problems when you try to leave the country.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Moldova Leu (MDL).

You can easily change euros and US dollars for MDL at banks and licensed money changers. You can rarely exchange Australian dollars.

Although parts of Moldova have a largely cash-based economy, major hotels – especially in Chisinau – widely accept traveller's cheques and credit cards.

Some major hotels accept traveller's cheques and credit cards.

Always keep your credit card in sight. Fraud is a risk.

You'll find very few ATMs outside the capital. Take care at ATMs. People have reported unauthorised withdrawals after using electronic banking in Moldova.

Use ATMs in controlled areas like banks, shops and shopping centres.

#### Local travel

Always carry your passport when you cross borders.

Monitor local media and ask transport providers for up-to-date information on border conditions.

#### Driving permit

You'll need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Moldova.

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Roads are poorly maintained, and street lighting is rare.

Driving is hazardous because of pedestrians, farm vehicles and wandering livestock.

If you intend to drive in Moldova:

* find out about local road rules
* avoid driving at night

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer whether your policy covers you when riding a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only official taxis and limousines. Book these through your hotel.

Unofficial taxis may overcharge. They may also not comply with safety standards.

Taxis that look official can still be unlicensed.

Don't share a taxi with strangers.

#### Public transport

Buses connecting Chisinau with other major cities are frequent.

Standards aren't the same as in Australia. Minibus accidents are common. Many buses are old and overcrowded.
