## Overview

### Safety

* Exercise a high degree of caution in Moldova due to the volatile security environment and military conflict in neighbouring Ukraine.
* Large political protests can occur in Moldova. Public demonstrations and events can turn violent and attract a heavy police presence. Avoid protests and rallies. Monitor the media for information about protests.
* Bomb threats have been made against the international airport, shopping centres and other official buildings in the capital, Chisinau. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Do not travel to Transnistria due to the volatile security situation and the impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's a region outside the control of the Moldovan authorities. If you travel to Transnistria despite our advice, our ability to provide consular assistance will be severely limited.

### Health

* Tick-borne diseases are a risk. Ticks are active in forested areas from spring to autumn. Check your body for ticks if you travel to forests.
* Waterborne, foodborne and infectious diseases are common. Boil tap water or drink bottled water. Avoid ice cubes, unpasteurised dairy products, and raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities and supplies are limited. If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated. Make sure your insurance covers this.
