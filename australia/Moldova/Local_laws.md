# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under ourÂ [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Moldova has severe penalties for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs. These include long sentences in local jails and heavy fines.

#### Exporting goods

Strict regulations cover the export of antiques, artworks and items of historical significance, including modern art and posters, if they're rare or valuable.

If you want to export these items, seek approval from the Moldovan Department of Monuments.

You'll need to provide evidence of approval to export when you leave. You may also need receipts of purchase.

Moldovan customs authorities must process all goods for entry into Ukraine. Businesses based in Transnistria could face difficulties importing or exporting goods if the business isn't registered in Moldova.

#### Other laws

You must always carry identity documents. This could be a copy of your passport.

If you can't produce identity documents for police when asked, they can detain and fine you.

It's illegal to:

* drive with a blood alcohol level greater than 0.0%, meaning driving after consuming any alcohol is prohibited
* take photos of military sites, government buildings and other infrastructure

Businesses need to register with the State Registration Chamber of the Ministry of Informational Development. It's illegal to operate a business without first registering it. This also applies to businesses in Transnistria.

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Dual citizenship is legally recognised in Moldova.

If you're an Australian citizen but also a citizen of Moldova, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.
