#### Civil unrest and political tension

Debris from missiles and drones fired by Russia at targets in neighbouring Ukraine has landed in Moldova on a number of occasions.

Large political protests have occurred in Chisinau and other places in Moldova. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Local street disturbances can start with little warning. Protests can attract a heavy police presence. You should monitor the media for information on political developments that might affect protest activity in Moldova. 

To stay safe:

* avoid demonstrations, protests and street disturbances
* monitor the news for possible unrest and avoid those places
* obey the local authorities

#### Crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching and other petty crimes are common, particularly in Chisinau. Criminals target trains and hotel rooms.

Police officers, or people posing as police officers, may ask for bribes, including in tourist areas.

Internet fraud can originate in Moldova, including some dating and marriage [scams](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers").

To reduce the risk of being a target for crime:

* keep your personal belongings close, particularly on trains and in other crowded areas
* be wary of business, dating or marriage proposals from people you've met online
* monitor local media for crime news

If police stop you and ask you to pay a fine:

* ask to see their ID
* offer to go to the nearest police station to pay
* get an official receipt for any payments

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

In recent years, bomb threats have been made against the international airport, shopping centres and other official buildings in the capital, Chisinau. Disruptions and delays are likely to occur as authorities respond to any threats – even if threats are hoaxes, Moldovan authorities take time to assess the situation thoroughly. Monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities.

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Moldova, they can still happen.

In recent years, terrorists have staged attacks in European cities.

To stay safe:

* look out for possible threats
* avoid possible targets for terrorist attacks
* report anything suspicious to the police
* monitor the media for emerging threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a worldwide threat.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Moldova is in an [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone. Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"), including heavy snow and wind, may cause power outages.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") happens:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* keep in contact with your friends and family
* monitor local media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
* Register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts on major disasters.

#### Travel to Transnistria

Do not travel to Transnistria due to the volatile security situation. 

Events in Ukraine have led to political tension in Transnistria. The security situation is volatile and could deteriorate at short notice. 

Transnistria is not under Moldovan government control.

If you're in Transnistria, monitor your personal security plans and leave when it's safe to do so.

If, despite our advice, you choose to travel to Transnistria:

* confirm your travel insurance will cover you
* arrange personal security measures
* make contingency plans
* stay for as short a time as possible

Our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited if you're in Transnistria.
