#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some medications may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Moldova. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) and other tick-borne diseases are a risk, especially in forest areas.

Ticks are common in forested areas from spring to autumn: April to October.

To protect yourself from disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing
* check your body for ticks during and after travel in forest areas

#### Other health risks

Waterborne and foodborne diseases are common.

Other common [infectious diseases](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/diseases) include:

* [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/measles)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* boil tap water or drink bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid unpasteurised dairy products

Get medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are limited, especially outside major cities. They often don't have enough medical supplies.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to evacuate to somewhere with proper care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
