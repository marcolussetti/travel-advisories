# Safety

#### Crime

The crime rate is low in Niue. Sometimes, thieves target travellers. Watch your belongings.

Thieves target items:

* on sea tracks
* left unsecured, such as valuables stored in motor vehicles

Occasionally, travellers are [assaulted](/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted "I've been assaulted overseas"). Look out for suspicious behaviour.

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can easily be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.  
  
Social media can also be particularly risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested in the past for things that they've said on social media. Never comment on local laws, customs or political events on your social media.

#### Outdoor safety

#### Local wildlife

Some dogs are aggressive, can travel in packs and have bitten people. Avoid travelling alone when walking and cycling.

#### Swimming safety

Some swimmers have died because of strong rips and large waves. Many swimming areas are only safe during low tide.

Ask tour operators about safe areas for swimming and water sports. If you're still not sure, double check the safety of your travel by contacting [Niue Tourism.](https://www.niueisland.com/contact)

At certain times of the year, some swimming spots in Niue are closed for traditional fishing activities.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. Niue Tourism has an accreditation program, where operators must meet minimum standards. Check if your operator is accredited on the [Niue Tourism website.](https://www.niueisland.com/accommodation-1#:~:text=Niue%20Tourism%20has%20established%20minimum,improve%20business%20and%20sustainability%20outcomes.)

This includes:

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* Check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* Ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* Always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners and where large crowds may gather.
