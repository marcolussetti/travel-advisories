# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to Iraq due to the volatile security environment and the threat of kidnapping. If you are in Iraq, you should leave Iraq immediately by commercial means. If you're staying in Iraq, be alert and monitor media for updates (see 'Safety').   
  
Conflicts in the Middle East could result in an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions. The security situation in the Middle East is unpredictable and could deteriorate further with little warning. There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region, as well as the potential for terrorist attacks. Australians in Iraq should read our general advice about terrorism risks and protecting your safety during an armed conflict (see ‘Safety’).  
  
If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iraq and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice. You should consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route and you should make your own assessment whether it's safe for you to travel in current circumstances. This includes considering the security situation and the potential risks involved. If you are not confident in the safety and reliability of any departure option, follow the advice of local authorities.   
  
Iraq’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign nationals and may close at short notice. Check our travel advice for your destination including visa requirements.   
  
Terrorist attacks can occur without warning. Avoid possible targets including markets, transport hubs, places of worship and government facilities.  
  
The US Embassy in Baghdad issued a security alert on 15 June warning of an increased potential for terrorist attacks and to avoid locations frequented by foreigners (see ‘Safety’).

* The security situation in Iraq is volatile and could deteriorate with little warning. There's a risk of violence, armed conflict, kidnapping and terrorist attacks. You should leave immediately by commercial means if it's safe to do so.
* Terrorist attacks can occur without warning. Avoid possible targets such as crowded places and public spaces, including markets, transport hubs, places of worship and government facilities. If you must visit them, always have an exit plan.
* The US Embassy in Baghdad issued a [security alert](https://iq.usembassy.gov/security-alert-for-u-s-citizens-u-s-embassy-iraq-june-15-2025/) on 15 June warning of an increased potential for terrorist attacks. Avoid locations frequented by foreigners and any large gatherings or crowds.
* If you intend to travel by land into a neighbouring country, check the latest public information from local authorities in Iraq and your destination on visa and border arrangements. Borders may close without notice. You should consider the risks carefully before attempting to leave by any route and you should make your own assessment whether it's safe for you to travel in current circumstances. This includes considering the security situation and the potential risks involved. If you are not confident in the safety and reliability of any departure option, follow the advice of local authorities. Iraq’s borders with neighbouring countries may have restrictions for foreign nationals and may close at short notice. Check our travel advice for your destination including visa requirements.
* Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.
* If you decide to travel to Iraq, despite our advice, you should remain vigilant. Ensure you have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place. You should get professional security advice and keep up to date with the latest developments.
* Large protests and political rallies occur regularly across Iraq. These can quickly turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings. If you're caught in an affected area, stay indoors. Follow the advice of local authorities or your security provider.
* There's an ongoing threat to foreigners and foreign interests, including cafes, hotels and restaurants.
* There's a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. Terrorists and criminal gangs may kidnap expats working in Iraq. Academics, journalists and aid workers are at a higher risk. You should review your security arrangements regularly and carefully consider any travel plans.
* Violent crime, including kidnapping, murder and robbery, is common. Organised criminal gangs, militia and tribal groups are significant threats. Corruption is common.
* Be alert to scams. Scammers may claim to represent the Australian or Iraqi governments or say they're Iraqi importers. Tell the [Australian Embassy in Baghdad](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/australian-embassy-iraq.aspx) if you're contacted by people or websites claiming to represent the Australian Government. Contact the [Iraqi Embassy in Canberra](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/94) before making any payments to people claiming to be from the Iraqi Government. Get legal advice if an Iraqi importer contacts you or your company.

### Travel

* If you're in Iraq despite our advice, leave as soon as you can.
* If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq, you must apply online at the [e-Visa Portal](https://evisa.iq/en) to obtain an electronic visa before you travel to Iraq. Airlines are required to ensure passengers have secured an electronic visa before allowing them to board flights to Iraq.
* You'll require a visa to travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. You can apply for an e-visa online before arrival on the Kurdistan Regional Government's [e-visa portal](https://visit.gov.krd/). It's also possible to obtain a visa on arrival. This visa is valid for travel in Kurdistan only. If you plan to travel outside of Kurdistan to other regions of Iraq, you must obtain an Iraqi visa before travelling to Iraq.
* You must visit the [Immunodeficiency Screening Centre](https://ur.gov.iq/index/show-eservice/50897/10035/cat) within 10 days of your arrival in Iraq for an examination to verify your health status, including tests for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and communicable diseases.
* Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Check requirements with your airline before you travel.
* There are security checkpoints throughout Iraq. Follow the instructions of officials at checkpoints. Criminals and terrorists have used false security checkpoints to stage kidnappings, robberies and murders or launch attacks.
* Road travel can be dangerous. Risks include roadside bombs, attacks at checkpoints and robberies. If you need to travel by road, get professional security advice from a reputable company. Avoid travelling at night.
