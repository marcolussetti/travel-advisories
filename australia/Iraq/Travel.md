#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas and border measures

If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq, you must apply online at the [e-Visa Portal](https://evisa.iq/en) to obtain an electronic visa before your travel to Iraq. Airlines are required to ensure passengers have secured an electronic visa before allowing them to board flights to Iraq.

Authorities may refuse entry to Iraq if your passport contains Israeli stamps or visas.

You require a visa to travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. You can find details and apply on the Kurdistan Regional Government's [e-visa portal](https://visit.gov.krd/). If you arrive in Kurdistan without a visa you can apply online using the e-visa portal or obtain a visa on arrival. These visas are valid for travel in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq only. If you plan to travel outside of Kurdistan to other regions of Iraq, you must obtain an Iraqi visa before travelling to Iraq.

Ensure you understand the conditions of your visa, especially if you are travelling as a member of a group.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules, contact either:

* an [embassy or consulate of Iraq](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/94), or
* the [Iraqi Ministry of Interior (Arabic)](https://moi.gov.iq/)

If you're in Iraq, you should leave as soon as you're able to do so. If you travel to Iraq despite our advice, contact your travel provider or the nearest [embassy or consulate of Iraq](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/94) for the latest information on entry requirements prior to departure.

#### Other formalities

For a child travelling without a parent, the guardian must carry documentation saying that the child's parents allow the travel.

An Australian-Iraqi dual national child with an Iraqi father may need to obtain permission from the child's father before authorities will let the child leave Iraq.

#### Land borders

If despite our advice, you travel to border areas note that border crossings can close with little or no warning.

Sensitive border areas, especially with [Syria](/destinations/middle-east/syria "Syria") and [Türkiye](/destinations/europe/turkiye "Türkiye"), are military targets.

#### Checkpoints

Security checkpoints are stationed throughout Iraq.

At these checkpoints:

* follow the instructions of local authorities
* exercise extreme caution

Criminals and terrorists have used false security checkpoints to:

* stage kidnappings, [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") and murders
* launch attacks

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for at least 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who want to use your identity to commit crimes. Always keep it in a safe place.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Iraqi Dinar (IQD).

On exit and entry you must declare all amounts in excess of IQD200,000, US$10,000, or the same value in other foreign currencies. Gems, jewellery or other items valued at US$10,000 or more must be declared.

US dollars and euros are the easiest foreign currencies to exchange at local commercial banks and exchange bureaus.

#### Local travel

#### Road travel

Road travel is dangerous.

Dangers include:

* roadside bombs
* attacks at checkpoints
* [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery")
* drivers not following road rules
* poor driving

Drink driving is illegal. See [Local laws](#local-laws)

If, despite our advice, you need to travel by road, first:

* get professional security advice from a company with a good reputation

#### Air travel

Airport closures or flight suspensions may happen. Double-check your flight arrangements before travelling to the airport.

In the past, some airlines have suspended flights to and from Erbil and Sulaymaniyah International Airports due to political tensions.

Aviation safety and security standards may not meet those set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Iraq's air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=YI)with the Aviation Safety Network.
