# Safety

#### Security

The security situation in Iraq is unstable and could deteriorate with little warning.

If you're in Iraq, you should leave immediately by commercial means if it's safe to do so. If there are no commercial options for leaving Iraq, the Australian Government can't help you leave.

Curfews and other security conditions can change at short notice.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq:

* get professional security advice and regularly review your security measures
* have contingency plans
* never visit areas of military activity, including border areas
* obey restrictions set by local authorities
* monitor the media for new safety or security threats
* always be alert to your surroundings

Australian officials have adopted enhanced security measures.

#### Terrorism

There's a risk of terrorist attacks in Iraq. 

Attacks can occur at any time, but there's an increased risk during religious events. Attacks may also occur during political events, including international meetings, conferences or political rallies.

Targets for terrorist attacks include:

* Iraqi security forces
* government facilities
* checkpoints
* police stations
* recruiting centres
* military establishments

Terrorists may also target:

* Baghdad International Airport (BIAP)
* the International Zone in Baghdad
* public transport (and transport hubs)
* protests
* mosques and churches
* markets
* foreign-affiliated commercial businesses, including cafes, hotels and restaurants
* schools and universities
* funerals and religious gatherings
* foreign embassies
* other civilian infrastructure

The International Zone in Baghdad and BIAP have been targeted by rocket attacks and drones in the last 12 months.

Avoid potential targets. If you must visit them, always have an exit plan. 

Attacks using Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) occur throughout Iraq, including in Baghdad.

Iraqi security forces often conduct security operations across the country with little warning.

Armed groups are active throughout Iraq. They have conducted major coordinated attacks against the Iraqi Government and civilians.

There has also been fighting between armed groups and security forces in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 

A number of areas in the Kurdistan region remain susceptible to attacks by artillery, drones and rockets.

#### Kidnapping

There's a high, ongoing threat of kidnapping throughout Iraq.

Sources report that terrorists and criminal groups continue to look for opportunities to kidnap expats and Westerners throughout Iraq. Kidnappers have targeted:

* academics
* journalists
* people working for NGOs
* people working for foreign companies

Criminal gangs and terrorists demand large ransoms for releasing hostages. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to breach Australian anti-terrorism financing laws.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

Regularly re-assess your security arrangements and carefully consider any travel. Using professional security providers is important, but does not completely protect you.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Political rallies and protests often happen in Baghdad and other regions of Iraq.

Large crowds can quickly gather and turn violent. Avoid large public gatherings. Security restrictions, including curfews and interruption to internet and social media services, may occur with little notice.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq, monitor the media and other sources about possible unrest.

In Baghdad, most rallies and protests are held in Tahrir Square, or near the entrance to the International Zone or government buildings.

There have previously been violent clashes in and around the International Zone in Baghdad as well as other governorates of Iraq.

* In July 2023, protestors breached and set fire to the Swedish Embassy over the burning of the Qur’an in Stockholm by anti-Islam activists.  Subsequent Qur’an burnings by far-right extremists in other European nations saw large numbers of protestors attempt to enter the International Zone and breach a number of embassies
* On 29 August 2022, protesters entered the Government Palace and other government buildings in and around the International Green Zone in Baghdad, resulting in violent clashes

Protests can occur in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq due to regional tensions.

If you're in an affected area, stay indoors and follow the advice of local authorities or your security provider.

#### Crime

Violent crime, kidnappings, murders and [robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") occur. Corruption is common.

Organised criminal gangs, militia and tribal groups are significant threats.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq:

* travel with your vehicle's doors locked and windows up, even when moving
* secure your accommodation, including when you're inside
* always be alert to your surroundings

#### Scams and fraud

Some fraudulent websites and Facebook accounts in the past claimed to represent the Australian Government in Iraq. They approached local businesses for tender opportunities or individuals for visa application.

Tell the [Australian Embassy in Baghdad](https://iraq.embassy.gov.au/bdad/contact-us.html) if you're contacted by fake sites.

Some Australian businesses have been contacted by companies claiming to be Iraqi importers. They offer to do business in unusual or suspicious ways. Scammers may have knowledge of the industry and appear legitimate.

Get legal advice if you or your company is contacted.

Australian companies have been contacted by people claiming to represent the Government of Iraq. They are looking for payments associated with recently won contracts.

Get advice from the [Embassy of the Republic of Iraq](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/94) in Canberra before making any payments.

Some individuals offer to produce Iraqi identification cards. These cards are not accepted by local authorities and, if used, you could be arrested. Only obtain identification cards from relevant Iraqi authorities.

People claiming to represent the Australian Government have contacted some individuals to offer visas. To protect yourself from visa scams, you should only deal with official Australian Government channels such as the departmental website, Australian Visa Application Centres, or the Australian High Commission or Embassy in your country. Visit the Australian Government's [Visa Scams](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/visa-scams/what-you-need-to-know) page for tips on identifying scams.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Iraq can experience [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") and is in an active [earthquake](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") zone.

Sandstorms and dust storms are common during the spring and summer months. Where possible, you should remain inside during severe storms. Seek medical advice if you have breathing difficulties. Flights can be delayed or cancelled at short notice during severe storms.

From July to September, daytime temperatures can be over 50°C.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Iraq and there's a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe location
* monitor local media and the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* stay in touch with friends and family
