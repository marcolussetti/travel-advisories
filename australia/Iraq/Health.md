#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll probably need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Iraq.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need.

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Iraq. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases are common. Diseases caused by insect bites in some regions of Iraq include:

* [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever)
* [cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis)

To reduce your risks from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* always insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids) is present. Take steps to reduce your risk of exposure to the virus. Travellers with HIV/AIDs are [prohibited from entering Iraq.](https://www.visahq.com/iraq/customs/)

#### Bird flu (avian influenza)

The World Health Organization has confirmed human cases of [bird flu](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") in Iraq.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other [infectious diseases](/before-you-go/health/diseases "Infectious diseases") happen. These include:

* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [haemorrhagic fever](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/viral-haemorrhagic-fever)
* [typhoid](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/typhoid-and-paratyphoid)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness and disease:

* drink boiled or bottled water
* avoid ice cubes
* don't eat raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If an animal bites or scratches you, get medical help straight away.

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Polio

Iraq is no longer affected by wild poliovirus. However, it's still at risk from international spread of the disease.

Stay up to date with vaccinations against [polio (poliomyelitis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis). Get a booster dose before you travel.

#### Sandstorms and dust storms

Sandstorms and dust storms are common. They can cause allergies and breathing problems. During sandstorms or dust storms either stay indoors, wear a mask or seek medical advice.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in major cities are limited. In remote areas, they're very basic or not available.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated.

Medical evacuation is very expensive and may be difficult to arrange because of the security situation.
