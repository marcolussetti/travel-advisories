# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail terms and the death penalty.

#### Death penalty

Iraq applies the death penalty for a range of crimes, including murder, espionage, rape, kidnapping, terrorism, war crimes, smuggling antiquities and drug trafficking.

#### Other laws

In February 2023, Iraq prohibited the import, manufacture, and selling of alcoholic beverages of all sorts, punishable by fines of up to IQD 25m. Customs officers may also confiscate prohibited goods or items deemed a threat to the peace, security, health, environment, or social order of Iraq.

Commercial or labour dispute cases may take years to finalise. Before entering a commercial contract in Iraq, take legal advice, both in Australia and in Iraq.

It's illegal to:

* take antiques or artefacts out of the country
* preach anywhere except in a place of worship
* attempt to convert a Muslim
* abandon the Islamic faith if you're Muslim

Unauthorised filming in a public place is against the law. Authorities have arrested several foreign journalists for filming without approval.

It's also illegal to take photos or film government and security buildings, including:

* checkpoints
* military bases
* embassies

In 2024, Iraq criminalised same-sex relationships, changing gender, and the promotion of LGBTQ+ ideology, with large fines and prison terms of up to 15 years. Homosexuality is not socially accepted, and local attitudes towards the LGBTQIA+ community may be hostile. There are no legal protections against discrimination. Violence against LGBTQIA+ people, and their supporters, has occurred.

Local laws can change without notice. Check legal requirements with an [embassy or consulate of Iraq](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/94).

#### Family matters

Get professional advice for local legal matters before you travel. Know your rights and responsibilities, especially in family law, such as:

* divorce
* child custody
* child support
* [forced marriages](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/laws/forced-marriage)

Authorities have stopped Australians and Australian-Iraqi dual nationals from leaving Iraq. Relatives have legally placed border alerts ('stop orders') where there are pending family court matters. Overturning stop orders can be a time consuming and complicated process.

The Australian Government can't prevent or overturn a stop order on an Australian citizen.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Iraq recognises dual nationality.

If a dual-national child has an Iraqi father and the child wants to leave the country, you may need to provide proof of the father's permission to enable the child to travel.

#### Local customs

Hotels may not allow couples to stay unless they can provide proof that they're married.

The holy month of [Ramadan](/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan "Ramadan") is observed in Iraq. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking is illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are.
