#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

**Visitor visas**

You can stay for up to 90 days in a 6-month period without a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [nearest embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/70) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

You can also get details from [the Republic of North Macedonia Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Macedonian)](http://www.mfa.gov.mk/?language=en-gb).

**Entry and departure**

North Macedonia's borders are open to Australians, and flights have resumed.

Entry requirements could change at short notice.

Transits through North Macedonia are permitted. If you're transiting through North Macedonia, you must sign a transit declaration on entry and leave the country within 5 hours.

Although the North Macedonia side of the border may be open, the other side may be closed, or authorities may not allow Australian citizens to enter. It's your responsibility to ensure you can enter the country you plan to travel to before entering North Macedonia.

**Travelling with children**

You'll need consent from one or both parents to enter or depart North Macedonia for:

* a [child](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/who-you-are/children) aged under 18 years who isn't travelling with both parents
* a North Macedonia citizen under 14 years old who isn't travelling with both parents

Parents need to sign a written statement.

Get it stamped by:

* local court authorities, or
* a representative from an [embassy or consulate of the Republic of North Macedonia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/70).

You must show the statement to North Macedonia border authorities if asked.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country, even if you're transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The official currency is the Denar (MKD). You can't change it outside North Macedonia.

Declare foreign currency over 10,000 euros or equivalent on arrival. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash. If you don't, you could be detained and your money confiscated.

The economy is mainly cash-based. Major hotels and large shops accept credit cards.

ATMs increasingly accept international bank cards.

#### Local travel

**Kosovo border region**

Border crossings between North Macedonia and Kosovo may close at short notice.

Restricted zones exist around border crossing points with Kosovo. Check with local authorities or transport providers if you plan to cross there.

Mountain areas bordering Kosovo have landmines and unexploded remnants of war. Stick to roads and well-marked paths.

Seek local advice on how to minimise risks.

**Driving permit**

To drive in North Macedonia, you'll need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence, and
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

Driving without an IDP could void your insurance.

**Road travel**

Driving in rural areas can be dangerous due to the following:

* poorly maintained roads
* slow-moving farm equipment
* pedestrians and farm animals on the roads
* poor driving habits

In winter, snow and ice can be a hazard for drivers.

The ability of local authorities to clear roads after heavy snowfall varies throughout the country.

Learn road rules before you drive. In North Macedonia, the law requires:

* you have headlights or parking lights on at all times
* you and your passengers wear seatbelts if the car has them

The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0.05%.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers car, motorbike or other vehicle hire.

If riding a motorcycle, always wear a helmet.

Avoid hailing taxis in the street.

Sit in the back seat.

**Public transport**

Bus and rail services operate throughout the country.
