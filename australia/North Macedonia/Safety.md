#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

Violent protests have occurred in Skopje and other major cities.

Inter-ethnic violence could happen anywhere.

Security in areas bordering Kosovo is volatile. Tensions exist between ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian communities in the region.

* take care near the Kosovo border
* don't take photos near border crossings or military zones - see [Local laws](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/north-macedonia?#local-laws)

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor the media and other sources for possible action
* avoid affected areas
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in North Macedonia. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. 

Targets have included:

* public transport hubs
* places of worship/religious sites
* sporting venues
* shopping areas
* places of mass gathering, including those popular with foreigners

Security services have disrupted planned attacks.

To stay safe from terrorism:

* avoid known terrorist targets
* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* monitor the media and other sources
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the advice of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Crime

Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, happens in large cities and airports.

Credit card fraud is common.

To avoid being a victim of crime:

* take care of your belongings, especially in large cities and at airports
* carry bags and backpacks in front of you
* keep your credit card in sight when making purchases

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk. The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.
