#### Travel insurance

Make sure you have comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") for the whole time you’ll be away. 

Confirm what your policy covers, including in terms of activities, care, and health and travel disruptions. Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in North Macedonia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

There's a risk of [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) in forested areas and fields.

Ticks are common in country areas from spring to autumn.

To protect yourself from tick-borne disease:

* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

During and after visiting forested areas:

* check your body for ticks
* remove ticks from your body as soon as possible, being careful to remove the whole tick

If you see any ticks, monitor the tick site for signs of infection.

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases occur in North Macedonia. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Medical facilities are limited.

You'll need to pay an up-front deposit for medical services.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

Face masks are recommended in hospitals and aged care facilities.
