# Local laws

#### Local law

You'll be subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

If you're accused of a crime, authorities may not let you leave the Philippines until investigations and legal proceedings are finished.

The justice process can take a long time. Some court cases take years, and you may be held in detention for a long time before your trial is finalised.

Australians accused of crimes have experienced financial and other difficulties while waiting for their cases to finish.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long jail terms, including life imprisonment, for even small amounts.

A major clampdown on drugs - the war on drugs - has been underway since 2016. There are mandatory jail sentences for possessing even small amounts of illicit drugs. Thousands have been arrested and a large number of people have been killed in drug-related violence.

The Philippines also has strong laws against [child sex crimes](/before-you-go/laws/child-sex-offences "Child sex offences") and human trafficking. Authorities have arrested and prosecuted a number of foreigners, including Australians, for these offences. Sentences can include life imprisonment.

It's illegal to take photos of official buildings for publication.

It's illegal to take part in political rallies if you're not Filipino. Authorities may deport Australians or cancel their visas for being involved.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
