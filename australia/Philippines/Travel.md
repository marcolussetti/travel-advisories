#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You are permitted to enter the Philippines without a visa for a stay period of 30 days or less provided that you meet all of the requirements.

Failure to meet entry requirements may result in you being denied entry to the Philippines and detained until the next available flight to your port of departure or Australia, at your own expense.

See the following links for the latest information:

* [Philippine Embassy in Australia website](https://www.philembassy.org.au)
* [Philippines Bureau of Immigration website](https://immigration.gov.ph/)
* [Philippines Tourism](https://beta.tourism.gov.ph/)

Ensure you keep your visa up to date.  Failure to do so may result in you being:

* fined or arrested
* detained in immigration detention
* deported back to Australia at your cost
* blacklisted from future travel to the Philippines

Detention conditions in the Philippines do not compare with Australian standards, and deportation processes can be lengthy.

You can apply to extend your tourist visa (visa waiver) either online or in person through the [Philippines Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/?s=visa+waiver) and pay the appropriate fees.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Get further details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules from:

* the nearest [embassy or consulate of the Philippines](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/160)
* the [Philippines Bureau of Immigration website](https://immigration.gov.ph/)

#### Border measures

Australians are permitted to enter the Philippines without a visa for a period of 30 days or less provided that you meet all of the [requirements](https://etravel.gov.ph/entry-guidelines).

Your passport must be valid for at least six months, and you must have onward/return tickets for no later than 30 days from your arrival in the Philippines.

You must register at the [eTravel](https://etravel.gov.ph/) online portal and complete the electronic health declaration checklist in order to receive a QR code for validation by the Bureau of Quarantine.

Children under 15 years of age may need a Waiver of Exclusion Ground if they're:

* not accompanied by a parent
* coming to meet a parent or parents in the Philippines

You should declare any:

* local cash of more than PHP50,000 to Bureau of Customs officers at the airport when you arrive or leave
* amounts of more than $US10,000 or of the same value in a different foreign currency
* this covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

Confirm requirements through your travel provider or nearest Philippine Embassy.

Check and fully understand the requirements of the airline you're travelling with, as their requirements may be different.

Failure to meet entry requirements may result in you being denied entry to the Philippines and detained until the next available flight to your port of departure or to Australia. This will be at your own expense.

#### Departure from the Philippines

You must register your departure from the Philippines on the [eTravel](https://etravel.gov.ph/) online portal within 72 hours (but not less than 3 hours) before your scheduled departure.

Airlines and transiting country protocols may differ. It's important that you check and fully understand the requirements of the airline you are travelling with. You should also check requirements for the country you are transiting through.

You must have current visas and exit paperwork to depart. You may need an Emigration Clearance Certificate (ECC) from the Philippines Bureau of Immigration before you leave the Philippines if you have stayed in the Philippines for more than six months. You'll need to visit an immigration office in person to undertake biometrics. Allow enough time to complete this process at an immigration office. For more information visit the [Philippines Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/).

Children born in the Philippines who are leaving the country for the first time on a foreign passport will need an ECC.

You must pay any outstanding visa fees or fines or risk not being able to depart the country. You may be detained by the Philippine Government and subject to a lengthy deportation process.

You must have no outstanding legal issues or court cases. You need to contact the relevant court or the Bureau of Immigration to confirm that you do not have any travel restrictions (Hold Departure Order; Watchlist and Blacklist).

Check the [Philippines Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/) website for more detailed information or make an appointment to settle your visa issues.

Depending on your Philippine visa type (such as those issued by the Philippine Department of Justice (DoJ), the Philippine Board of Investments (BoI), the Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) or the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)), you may need to obtain a Travel Pass from the Department that issued your visa in order to leave the Philippines. If you hold an ECC issued by the [Bureau of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.ph/) you may be exempt from this requirement.

If you're leaving the Philippines from Mactan-Cebu or Clark International Airports, you need to pay a departure tax.

If transiting through a third country, ensure you have completed any forms to transit that country. Ensure you have six months validity on your passport.

#### Transiting through the Philippines

All passengers transiting through the Philippines should ensure they meet all Philippine [arrival requirements](https://etravel.gov.ph/entry-guidelines). Flight cancellations or delays have resulted in transit passengers who do not meet arrival requirements, having to remain inside the airport, sometimes for many days.

Airside transfer is not permitted between Terminal 3 and Terminal 1 or 2 of NAIA. All travellers transiting to or from Terminal 3 must pass through Immigration and meet all Philippine arrival requirements. You should allow plenty of time for arrival formalities and check-in for your next flight.

If you're denied entry, the Australian Embassy is not able to intervene in any decisions made by the Bureau of Immigration.

You should discuss options for transit with your airline or travel agent.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au).

#### Renewing

If you need to renew or replace your passport, please contact the Australian Embassy directly for advice about how we can assist you.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If you lose your passport on arrival into the Philippines, before passing through Immigration, you'll be refused entry to the Philippines. You'll be sent back to your port of origin by the Philippine Government and the Australian Government will be unable to help.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with ‘X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Philippine peso (PHP). You can easily convert AUD for PHP at airports, banks, shopping centres, tourist locations, in major cities and towns.

ATMs are widely available. International credit cards are generally accepted in hotels, restaurants and higher-end shops, particularly in cities and larger towns. However, it is advisable to keep some cash. Card skimming occurs.

#### Local travel

Travelling in the Philippines takes longer than it does in Australia.

#### Driving permit

You can use a current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted) for up to 90 days after you arrive. After that, you need to get a Philippines licence.

**More information:**

* [Land Transportation Office](http://lto.gov.ph/)

#### Road travel

Roads are generally congested and often in poor condition. Drivers often break the road rules.

Avoid driving off the national highways and other sealed roads, especially at night.

You're more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident in the Philippines than in Australia.

* [Driving or riding](/before-you-go/getting-around/road-safety "Road safety")

#### Motorcycles

Certified helmets are mandatory when riding in major cities. Accidents are frequent.

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you when riding a motorbike and if any exclusions apply. You might not be covered if you don't have a valid Australian motorcycle licence.

#### Taxis

Be careful if using taxis and remain alert. Some taxis are unroadworthy or may be unsafe due to poor maintenance. There have been cases where drivers and their accomplices have robbed or harmed passengers. Avoid displaying money or jewellery in taxis and don't hand your mobile phone to your driver if asked.

Use ridesharing apps and Grab taxis (the equivalent of Uber) or hire cars sourced from hotels as a preference. They're more reliable than taxis hailed on the street.

#### Public transport

Public road (bus, jeepneys) and rail transport is widely used throughout the country but should be avoided due to safety and security risks (see '[Safety')](#safety).

#### Sea travel

Sea travel in the Philippines can be hazardous.

Avoid ferries if you can.

If you must travel by sea:

* use a ferry service with a good reputation
* don't use ferries that are overcrowded and appear poorly maintained
* take your own lifejacket

[Piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy") and kidnapping occur in Philippine waters (see '[Safety')](#safety)
