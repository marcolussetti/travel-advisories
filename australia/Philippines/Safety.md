# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks, including bombings, are possible anytime, anywhere in the Philippines, including Manila.

The Philippine media occasionally reports that terrorists may be planning attacks.

Possible targets for future attacks include places travellers and expats visit, such as:

* aviation and airports
* transport hubs and the metro system
* hotels, shopping malls, clubs, restaurants, bars and markets
* places of worship
* outdoor recreation events
* other tourist areas

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

#### Mindanao and the southern Philippines

These areas have a high threat of:

* [terrorist attacks](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/terrorism)
* [kidnapping](/node/57)
* [piracy](/before-you-go/safety/piracy "Reducing the risk of piracy")
* violent crime
* violent clashes between armed groups

We continue to advise do not travel to central or western Mindanao. If despite our advice you visit these areas:

* get professional security advice
* have effective personal security measures in place

If you get into trouble, the Australian Government may be unable to help. In most cases, our ability to provide consular assistance in do not travel locations is extremely limited.

Any travel by Australian officials to do not travel locations is subject to high-level approval and is based on a rigorous risk assessment.

#### Terror attacks

Terror attacks include:

* On 3 December 2023 there was a terrorist attack in Marawi City resulting in four dead and many injured, leading to heightened security arrangements in Mindanao and elsewhere, including Manila.
* On 24 August 2020, a dual bomb attack in Jolo, Sulu killed 14 people and injured 75.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

Kidnapping can happen anywhere in the Philippines, including in metropolitan Manila. Kidnappers have killed victims. Kidnapping can be business, criminal or terrorism-related, and foreign nationals are affected. Kidnappings occur in rural, urban and coastal areas. Kidnappings linked to organised crime are becoming more common. Criminal kidnappers tend to target individuals perceived as wealthy. The threat of terrorism-related kidnapping is highest in central and western Mindanao, especially:

* along the Zamboanga Peninsula
* in the Sulu Archipelago
* off the coast of Sabah, Malaysia

Locals, expatriates and foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped in central and western Mindanao and in eastern Malaysia. Kidnappers sometimes hold victims for a long time, even for years, before releasing them. They sometimes kill their captives.

The threat of piracy in the southern Philippines is high, especially in the Sulu Archipelago.

If, despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping, our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations will be limited.

To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile - including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* don't display money or valuables in public
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone
* confirm car registration and driver identity before getting into a taxi or ride share
* if you're confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate - resistance tends to make the situation worse

For more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping, see [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping). 

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Paying a ransom to terrorist groups will likely break Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

There's an increased risk of demonstrations and civil unrest following recent events. Transport and other essential services may be disrupted. Monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.

See our general information on staying safe in case of [demonstrations](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/news-and-updates/demonstrations).

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people are not uncommon and can gather quickly. Sometimes they can turn violent.

It's illegal to take part in political rallies if you're not Filipino. Authorities may deport Australians or cancel their visas for being involved.

Armed clashes occur between security forces and militants, throughout the country but especially in central and western Mindanao.

The armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA), operates throughout the Philippines. They are often involved in attacks targeting Philippine security forces.

In central and western Mindanao, armed clashes between rival clans and other armed groups are common, often resulting in deaths.

If you see a confrontation between police and criminals or between rival groups, leave the area straight away.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Violent crimes, such as armed robbery in public places, sexual assault, and murder, occur regularly and are a serious problem in the Philippines, including Metro Manila.

Gun ownership is widespread and poorly regulated. This adds to the high rate of violent crime.

Gunfights between police and criminals have occurred in the past, including in tourist areas in Manila. People, including bystanders, have been killed or injured in such incidents.

Terrorist groups are sometimes involved in violent criminal activities in rural areas. They target business interests, including mining projects, for extortion.

Several Australians have died after property disputes turned violent.

There have been instances where armed criminals have robbed and killed or injured people on:

* buses
* the metro
* jeepneys

Avoid travel on these forms of transport.

Gangs are active in Manila, and provincial resort towns.

Gangs can drug, rob or assault tourists.

#### Petty crime and scams

Pickpocketing and bag snatching are common, including in Manila. Be careful in crowded shopping malls, bars and nightclubs, and other public places.

[Scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams), including those involving property ownership, business ventures, credit cards and ATMs, are common. You should seek legal advice before committing to any major financial decision.

Online relationship and friendship [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams) are common. In the past, victims, which have included Australians, have been blackmailed or found themselves facing legal action.

* Be cautious of anyone you meet online from overseas.
* Learn the signs of a relationship scam. Know what to watch for.
* Never send money.
* If you've already given them money, don't go overseas to try to get it back.
* Always confirm their identity (including their age), before going overseas to meet them.

Learn more about internet [friendship, dating and marriage scams](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/dating-romance) on ScamWatch.

To protect yourself from scams:

* undertake due diligence when entering into business ventures
* only use ATMs in secure locations such as banks, shops and shopping centres
* always keep your debit and credit cards in sight

To protect yourself from crime:

* always keep your personal belongings close, especially in crowded areas
* monitor local sources for information about new security risks

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Drink spiking & methanol poisoning

Drink spiking can occur, including in areas frequented by foreigners in Metro Manila. To reduce the risk of drink spiking:

* never accept food or drinks from strangers or leave drinks unattended
* if you aren't sure if a drink is safe, leave it
* stay with people you trust in bars, nightclubs and taxis

Get urgent medical attention if you think you or someone else has been drugged.

Methanol can be used in unregulated alcohol production to lower costs. Methanol is highly toxic. As little as one shot can be fatal. Act quickly if you suspect you or someone you're travelling with has been poisoned. [Urgent medical attention](/while-youre-away/when-things-go-wrong/medical-assistance "Medical assistance overseas") could save your life or save you from permanent disability. Report suspected cases of methanol poisoning to the police.

* be careful drinking cocktails and drinks made with spirits
* drink only at reputable licensed premises
* avoid home-made alcoholic drinks
* Labels on bottles aren't always accurate.

#### Swimming safety

Swimming off coastal areas is risky.

Severe currents and rips are common in coastal areas. Many travellers have drowned, including at popular resorts.

Lifeguards are rarely available.

A red flag means you shouldn't enter the water.

If you plan on swimming:

* take extra care when swimming off coastal areas
* never swim after dark or after consuming alcohol
* don't swim where there are red flags
* get local advice before swimming

Saltwater crocodiles are present in some locations in the Philippines, and fatal attacks have occurred. Ask for local advice, and don't swim in rivers or lagoons.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This includes for adventure activities such as diving.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

The Philippines experiences frequent [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/node/347), including:

* [Typhoons](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster")
* [Volcanic eruptions](/node/346)
* [Earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis")
* [Tsunamis](/node/346)

To protect yourself during a natural disaster:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof place
* monitor news and other weather information sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/)
* take official warnings seriously and follow the advice of local authorities
* have a plan of what to do
* keep in touch with friends and family

Identify local sources of support and advice that can help you after a natural disaster.

If you're visiting after a natural disaster, contact your tour operator to check if services are affected.

#### Typhoons

Typhoons usually occur between late May and December and cause significant damage and disruption.

The direction and strength of typhoons can change with little warning.

Typhoons may disrupt communications, including phones and internet. Transportation, including flights, may also be disrupted.

Heavy rain associated with typhoons may cause localised flooding and landslides.

If you're travelling during typhoon season:

* know your accommodation's evacuation plans
* identify your local shelter
* check the latest typhoon information at the [Joint Typhoon Warning Centre](http://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)

If there's a typhoon:

* adequate shelter may not be available
* flights and ferries could be delayed or suspended, and travel could be unsafe
* available flights and ferries may fill quickly
* ports could be affected

Contact your airline or travel provider for the latest flight information.

#### Earthquakes and volcanoes

The Philippines is located on the Ring of Fire. [Earthquakes](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/345) and volcanic eruptions are common. Following an earthquake or volcanic eruption, there may be disruptions to essential services.

* On 2 December 2023, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the island of Mindanao near Surigao del Sur. The earthquake and over 400 aftershocks of up to 6.9 magnitude resulted in widespread damage, injuries and several deaths.
* On 17 November 2023, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in the province of Sarangani on the island of Mindanao, resulting in several deaths, injuries and damage to infrastructure.
* On 27 July 2022, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Abra, Northern Luzon, resulting in landslides and damage to infrastructure. The earthquake was felt in Manila.
* On 12 August 2021, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit in Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental.
* On 24 July 2021, a 6.6 magnitude earthquake hit at an intermediate depth of 130km beneath the epicentre near Balayan, Luzon.
* On 7 February 2021 a 6.3 magnitude earthquake occurred 6km southeast of Magsaysay, Davao Del Sur at an intensity of 5 (strong) in Kidapawan City causing injuries and damage to the area.
* On 22 January 2021, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Jose Abad Santos, Davao Occidental.

Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has set up permanent danger zones (PDZ) around the summits of several volcanoes:

* Kanlaon volcano in Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental Provinces has a 4km PDZ
* Mayon volcano in Albay Province has a 6km PDZ
* Bulusan volcano in Sorsogon Province has a 4km PDZ
* the entire volcanic island of Taal is a PDZ

Avoid areas around all of these volcanoes.

The eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Negros Island on 3 June 2024 resulted in several domestic flight cancellations within the region.

On 12 January 2020, Taal Volcano, in the southern Luzon province of Batangas, erupted. Residents within 14 km were advised to evacuate, and ash clouds travelling over Manila affected both international and domestic flights at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

Volcanic activity may increase with little or no notice. It may disrupt flights in the region. Individual airlines make their own decisions about flight operations. Contact your airline or tour operator for up-to-date information.

If there is major volcanic activity, monitor warnings from the [Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)](https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/).

#### Tsunamis

Large and destructive tsunamis can happen.

If there's a tsunami warning:

* check the US [Tsunami Warning Centre](https://www.tsunami.gov/) website regularly
* follow the advice of local authorities

Move to high ground straight away if:

* you feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* you feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* you see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* you hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings. Once on high ground, monitor local media and weather services.
