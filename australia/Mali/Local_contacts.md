#### Consular contacts

Read the [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") for what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.

Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Mali.

The [Canadian Embassy in Bamako](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/mali/bamako.aspx?lang=eng) gives consular assistance to Australians in Mali. This includes issuing [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents).

If the security situation in Mali deteriorates, the level of consular assistance the Canadian Embassy can give to Australians may be limited.

You can also get limited consular assistance from the Australian High Commission in Accra, Ghana.
