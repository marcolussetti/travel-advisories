#### Travel Insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/149) before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

You'll likely need a special insurance policy that covers travel to high-risk destinations. Most Australian policies won't cover you for travel to Mali.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

#### Medication

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Mali. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Yellow fever](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/yellow-fever?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=yellowfever) (Department of Health and Aged Care) is widespread in Mali. Yellow fever is a potentially fatal virus spread by mosquitoes. It's prevented by vaccination. Get vaccinated before you travel.

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria), [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection) (World Health Organization), and other insect-borne diseases also occur.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

The [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) (World Health Organization) infection rate is high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the virus.

#### Lassa fever

[Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever) (World Health Organization) may be a risk when you have contact with rodents or with food or household items contaminated with rodent droppings.

To protect yourself from disease:

* avoid contact with live or dead rodents, burrows or nests and their droppings
* ensure all foods are well-cooked and covered in rodent-proof containers
* keep your body, personal belongings, utensils and common contact surfaces (including door knobs and counters) clean
* avoid places where dust is raised, such as from sweeping and vacuuming rodent droppings

Get immediate medical help if you develop any symptoms of Lassa fever, including fever, weakness in your body or unexplained pain.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne, parasitic, and other infectious diseases are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [cholera](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [meningitis](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/meningitis/en/)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)

Serious outbreaks can occur. If there is a serious outbreak of infectious disease, follow the advice of local authorities.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* don't swim in freshwater
* Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Bamako are limited. Facilities in rural areas are even more basic.

Local health services may have difficulty responding to outbreaks of infectious disease.

Medical expertise is lacking. Burns and mortuary facilities are limited.

Most medical staff only speak basic English.

You'll need to pay up-front for medical services.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
