#### Terrorism

There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping throughout Mali, including intermittent high-profile attacks in the capital Bamako, which can result in serious injury and death.

The security situation in northern, central, and increasingly in southern Mali is dangerous and volatile. Attacks targeting security forces, civilians and foreign interests regularly occur by terrorist and other armed groups who operate in these areas. Terrorist groups have directly threatened foreign interests operating in Mali. These groups have fuelled inter-community tensions in the area, resulting in regular ethnic group clashes. There are ongoing military operations throughout the country.

If you're in Mali despite our advice, you should consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so.

Further attacks are very likely. Attacks can occur in places visited by foreigners, including:

* security installations and areas frequented by security forces
* airports, public transport and other transportation hubs and networks
* public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels
* hospitals
* places of worship
* mining operations
* embassies and government buildings, including schools

If, despite our advice, you travel to Mali, stay alert to protect yourself from terrorism:

* get professional security advice
* use effective personal security measures
* be alert to possible threats in public places
* avoid all large gatherings, including festivals, large sporting events and any public demonstrations or protests
* report suspicious activity or items to the police
* monitor the media for threats, curfews, and other restrictions
* take official warnings seriously
* follow advice from local authorities
* register for security alerts from the [US Embassy in Mali](https://ml.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) and the [Canadian Embassy in Mali](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/mali/index.aspx?lang=eng)
* be ready to leave the country at short notice

Have an exit plan ready if you must go to a place that is a possible target.

If an attack occurs, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.  
  
Kidnapping by groups such as Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) and other regional Islamist groups is a very high risk across Mali.

Several foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped in Mali. Active terrorist groups maintain the intent and capability to kidnap foreigners.

The kidnapping risk of foreign nationals in southern Mali is increasing. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted.

Possible targets include:

* foreign mining interests
* aid workers
* long-term residents of Mali
* foreign nationals

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.   
  
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger
* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan
* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures
* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns
* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking
* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night
* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens
* avoid talking about your money or business affairs
* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours
* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims
* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity.

Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The Malian armed forces initiated a coup d’état in August 2020, establishing a transitional government. Presidential elections have been postponed from 2024 to 2026. Monitor local media and register for security alerts from the [US Embassy in Mali](https://ml.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) and the [Canadian Embassy in Mali](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/mali/index.aspx?lang=eng).

Due to the withdrawal of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the security situation across the Sahel, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Mali.

The security situation could deteriorate quickly.

A state of emergency is currently in effect throughout Mali. Heightened security measures are in place, including random identity checks and roadblocks. Carry identification and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.

Expect a strong security presence, including police patrols, vehicle and personal security checks and police and security checks on restaurants.

Be aware that:

* night-time checkpoints and roadblocks are common
* curfews can be set suddenly

If, despite our advice, you travel to Mali, protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* keep your vehicle and personal ID documents with you
* approach security checkpoints slowly and follow instructions
* arrange personal security measures
* always have up-to-date travel documents
* avoid sensitive areas, such as government and military facilities
* monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities
* maintain stocks of food, water and emergency supplies

#### Demonstrations and protests

Demonstrations, protests and mass gatherings often occur in Bamako. Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent, with reports of death and injuries. Public demonstrations in and around Bamako have encountered a strong police and security force presence.

The political and security situation could get worse suddenly.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Mali:

* avoid political rallies, protests, and large crowds
* monitor local social media/news
* have contingency plans and be ready to leave at short notice

If you get caught up in a protest, stay indoors and away from the windows. Leave the area as soon as it's safe.

#### Crime

#### Violent crime

Crime is on the rise in Mali, particularly in Bamako, which has seen an increase in armed assaults and robberies.

[Armed robbery](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery), [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping) and carjackings occur, particularly in the northern regions. 4WD vehicles are common targets.

Bandits are active in remote areas.

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing and theft are common in urban areas.

If, despite our advice, you travel to Mali:

* pay attention to your safety and security
* keep vehicle windows and doors locked, even when moving
* don't visit banks or use ATMs alone
* use ATMs in banks, hotels, and secure buildings

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Scams and fraud

Internet fraud is common and often starts in West African countries. People have lost money to internet [scams](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/scams).

Internet scams may present to you as romances, friendships, or business and employment opportunities. These scams usually start via internet dating sites or chat rooms.

Victims have also travelled to Mali or other West African countries to meet a friend or someone they intend to marry that they have met online or to get back money. They've been at risk of [kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping), [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/assault) and robbery. Some victims have been killed.

Criminals might:

* ask you to send money so they can travel to Australia to meet you
* ask for details of a bank account overseas to transfer large amounts of money as a donation or for a percentage
* provide fake cashier cheques for urgent shipments of large quantities of goods
* ask for large fees for a fake government contract
* steal money from people they have invited to Africa for a business opportunity

To protect yourself from scams:

* be wary of online contact from people you don't know
* don't send money to anyone until you've thoroughly checked them

If you're the victim of a scam, get legal advice. Don't travel to Mali to get your money back or to get revenge. You could be in danger.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
