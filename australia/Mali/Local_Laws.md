# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling. Malian authorities may define certain behaviours and activities as criminal that would not be considered as such in Australia. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or harsh enforcement of local laws for unintentionally breaking the law.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs are severe. You could receive a heavy fine or a long jail sentence.

#### Other laws

The death penalty applies for serious offences, including:

* murder
* encouraging rebellion against the Government
* spying

It's illegal to photograph:

* military zones, assets and personnel
* transport facilities

You'll need permission from the National Museum in Bamako to buy or remove archaeological objects from Mali.

Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. Violence, threats, extortion, eviction and arbitrary arrest of LGBTQIA+ people can occur. LGBTQIA+ travellers should consider travel plans and personal security carefully.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Mali recognises dual nationality.

If you're a dual citizen, this limits the [consular service](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Always travel on your [Australian passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

You may need to perform civil or military service in Mali if you're a dual national. Check with the nearest [Embassy of Mali](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/123) before you travel.

#### Local customs

#### Dressing standards

Conservative standards of dress and behaviour apply in Mali.

Avoid revealing clothing and inappropriate displays of public affection. Take care not to offend.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events/ramadan) is observed in Mali. Respect religious and cultural customs and laws at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
