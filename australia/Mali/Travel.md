#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to Mali, you'll need to get a visa.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [Embassy of Mali](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/123)for details about visas, currency, customs, and quarantine rules.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You must carry a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mali. You may be asked to show it at the airport when you leave.

You may need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to travel to other countries after visiting Mali.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with X gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can’t guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the West African CFA Franc (XOF).

Exchange traveller's cheques at major banks.

ATM facilities are limited.

Some major hotels in Bamako accept credit cards.

Credit cards are rarely accepted outside Bamako. Make sure you have enough cash to meet your needs.

#### Local travel

#### Local restrictions

The Australian High Commission in Accra has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in Mali.

#### Landmines

Landmines and improvised explosive devices are found in the north and northeast of Mali.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Mali, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Terrorist attacks on convoys, crime, kidnapping, and poor conditions make road travel dangerous, particularly at night. Exercise extreme caution.

Driving conditions get worse in the rainy season from June to September.

To reduce your risks, get professional security advice before you leave.

Only travel by road if you have proper security measures in place.

Always wear a helmet when travelling by motorcycle.

#### Taxis

Avoid taxis where possible due to poor driving and security threats. If you must travel by taxi, use registered taxis. It's best to arrange them through your hotel.

#### Public transport

Public transport is dangerous due to security threats. Avoid public transport.

#### Air travel

Flight schedules can change, and flights can be cancelled with little warning.

At Senou International Airport in Bamako, authorities may search your vehicle at a checkpoint. Make sure everyone in the vehicle has identification with them.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Mali, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a [Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM)](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/A0001-23%20MALI-Plain-Text.pdf). Airlines may issue their own travel advice if, despite our advice, you travel to Mali. Check with your travel provider.

Check [Mali's air safety profile](https://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TZ) with the Aviation Safety Network.
