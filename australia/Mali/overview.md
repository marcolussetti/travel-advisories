# Overview

Latest update

We continue to advise do not travel to Mali. You're subject to all local laws and penalties, which can be interpreted broadly and applied harshly by Australian standards. Australians may be at risk of arbitrary detention or enforcement of local laws for unintentionally breaking the law.  
  
There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorism throughout Mali, including the capital, Bamako. Terrorists have targeted security forces, civilians and foreign interests, resulting in casualties, including civilians. Terrorist groups have directly threatened foreign interests operating in Mali. Attacks can occur in places visited by foreigners, including airports, public transport and transportation hubs, tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets and hotels (see 'Safety').  
  
The security situation in southern Mali has further deteriorated. The kidnapping risk of foreign nationals in southern Mali is increasing. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted.  
  
Do not travel to Mali due to the high threat of terrorism and kidnapping. The Canadian Embassy can provide limited emergency consular assistance to Australians (see 'Local contacts').

## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation is volatile. If you're in Mali despite our advice, consider leaving by commercial means if it's safe to do so. If you decide to remain in Mali, be prepared to leave the country at short notice.
* There's an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attacks throughout Mali, including in the capital Bamako. Serious injuries and deaths have occurred as a result. Terrorist groups have directly threatened foreign interests operating in Mali.
* Significant dates such as holidays are periods of heightened risk. Further attacks are very likely. Avoid public places. Take official warnings seriously. Get professional security advice before you travel.
* The security situation in northern, central, and increasingly southern Mali is dangerous and volatile. Attacks targeting security forces, civilians and foreign interests regularly occur by terrorist and other armed groups who operate in these areas. These groups have fuelled inter-community tensions in the area, resulting in regular ethnic group clashes. There are ongoing military operations throughout the country.
* There's a very high risk of kidnapping in Mali. The risk of kidnapping of foreign nationals in southern Mali is increasing. Foreign nationals and foreign interests, including mining operations, may be targeted. Ransoms paid to kidnappers may fund terrorism.
* Armed robbery and carjackings also occur. Several groups target foreigners. Keep vehicle doors and windows locked, even when moving.
* Protests, marches, and demonstrations can occur with little notice. If you become aware of any protests, marches, or demonstrations, leave the area immediately, remain vigilant and follow local news.

### Health

* Yellow fever occurs throughout Mali. Get vaccinated before you travel. You'll need a yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Mali.
* Other insect-borne diseases present in Mali include dengue and malaria. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent. Consider taking anti-malarial medication.
* The HIV/AIDS infection rate is high. Take precautions if you're taking part in high-risk activities.
* Common waterborne, foodborne, parasitic and other infectious diseases include cholera, hepatitis and meningitis. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food.
* Medical facilities and expertise in Bamako are limited. They're worse in rural areas. If you're seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Ensure you have enough money to cover this.

### Local laws

* You're subject to all local laws and penalties, which can be interpreted broadly and applied harshly by Australian standards. You could unintentionally break the law and be at risk of arbitrary detention or harsh enforcement of local laws.
* Don’t use, carry, or import illegal drugs. Punishments for drug offences include heavy fines and lengthy prison sentences.
* Avoid speaking out against the government. Local authorities could see this as provocative. Severe penalties, including the death penalty, may occur.
* Be careful when taking photos. It’s illegal to photograph military zones, assets, and personnel. It’s also illegal to take pictures of transport facilities and government buildings.
* Engaging in same-sex activity is illegal and could lead to prison sentences. Violence, threats, extortion, eviction and arbitrary arrest of LGBTQIA+ people can occur. LGBTQIA+ travellers should consider travel plans and personal security carefully.
* Mali recognises dual citizenship. If you’re Australian and a citizen of Mali, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you’re there. Always travel on your Australian passport.
* Mali’s customs, laws and regulations closely adhere to Islamic practices. Dress conservatively, behave discreetly and respect Malian religious and social traditions to avoid offending local sensitivities.

* If you travel in Mali, despite our advice, get professional security advice and only travel by road if you have proper security measures in place. Public transport is dangerous, don't use it.

### Local contacts

* The [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/node/46) details what the Australian Government can and can't do to help you overseas.
* Australia doesn't have an embassy or consulate in Mali. The [Canadian Embassy in Bamako](https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/mali/bamako.aspx?lang=eng) can assist Australians in Mali, including issuing [provisional travel documents](https://www.passports.gov.au/travel-related-documents). If the security situation gets worse, this assistance may be limited. Our ability to provide consular services in Mali is extremely limited.
* You can also get consular assistance from the [Australian High Commission in Accra, Ghana](http://www.ghana.highcommission.gov.au/). The Australian High Commission in Accra currently has very limited capacity to provide consular assistance in West Africa, except in Ghana.
* To stay up to date with local information, follow the High Commission's social media accounts.
