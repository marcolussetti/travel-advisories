#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least eight weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the Czech Republic. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

Ticks are common in country areas. They're active from March to November.

If you're in forest or country areas, you're at risk of tick-borne diseases, such as [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) (World Health Organization).

#### Medical care

Medical facilities are of Western standards. The quality of care in the Czech Republic is generally good, with private facilities usually being of a higher standard than public ones.

Healthcare providers often request payment in advance for services, including emergency care.
