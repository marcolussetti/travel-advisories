# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/node/46). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and may include long jail terms

The Australian Embassy can't provide:

* information on clinics

#### Other laws

It's illegal to photograph some buildings, including indoor shopping centres.

These buildings usually have signs banning photos.

If in doubt, ask local authorities before you take a photo.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.
