# Safety

#### Crime

#### Petty crime

Pickpocketing is common in Prague. It happens on the road to Prague Castle, at tourist sites and on public transport.

Passport and car theft is also common, particularly during the summer, from June to August.

Travellers have been [robbed](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery") in nightclubs, bars and restaurants. This includes fast-food shops in the centre of Prague.

Be careful of strangers who offer help. Travellers have had bags stolen at Prague's main railway station. Do not leave your bags unattended while on public transport.

Travellers have been robbed or [assaulted](/before-you-go/safety/assault "Reducing the risk of assault") after drinking a spiked drink.

Only use ATMs in secure places, such as banks, shops and shopping centres.

Always carry ID, for example, a copy of your Australian passport.

To stay safe in the Czech Republic:

* keep an eye on your food and drink - never accept them from strangers
* stay with people you trust in bars and nightclubs
* be wary of strangers who offer to help you
* keep your bags, wallets and passports safe

Report any thefts in person to the Czech police within 24 hours and get a police report crime number. Prague police station (Jungmannovo namesti 9, Prague 1, nearest metro stop is Mustek) is open 24 hours and has English translators. You can also get a police report from the police station at the airport.

Every lamppost in Prague has a 6-digit number posted at eye level. These codes will help you tell the police where you are if you can't give an exact address.

#### Scams and fraud

Criminals using fake police ID may ask to check the authenticity of your foreign currency and passport. These criminals often operate near ATMs. However real police officers can ask for ID at any time.

If you think you're dealing with a criminal posing as a police officer, either:

* offer to go with them to the nearest police station
* call the police on 112 to confirm their identity

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.
