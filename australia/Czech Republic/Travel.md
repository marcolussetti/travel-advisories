#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visitor visas

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.

The Czech Republic is a part of the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area"), along with many other European countries. This may allow you to enter the Czech Republic without a visa in some situations, such as short tourism stays.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of the Czech Republic](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/54) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

See the Ministry of the Interior [Immigration Portal](https://frs.gov.cz/en/) for information on entering and staying in the Czech Republic.

#### Border measures

Since 16 September 2024, Germany and Austria have temporarily put in place border checks on their land borders, including with the Czech Republic.

#### European Entry/Exit System (ESS)

On 12 October, the new European Union's (EU) [European Entry/Exit System (EES)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/ees) for registering all non-EU nationals, including Australians, travelling in or out of the Schengen area, starts.

European countries using the EES will gradually introduce the system at their external borders. Data collection will be introduced at border crossing points with full implementation by 10 April 2026.

After it is fully implemented, EES registration will replace the current system of manually stamping passports. ​

The registration process should only take a few minutes but there may be longer border queues when the new system starts.

When travelling into and out of the Schengen area, for short stays, you may need to 

* have your fingerprints and photo taken
* answer Schengen Border Code questions

This creates a digital record that registers your biometric details.

If you revisit the Schengen area within 3 years of creating your digital record, you'll only need to provide either your fingerprint or photograph at the border on entry and exit.

If you frequently travel to Schengen areas for work and/or leisure purposes, you must ensure that your total stay in the Schengen area is no more than 90 days in every 180 days. Be aware of immigration penalties and enforcement for exceeding the limit in any individual country you plan to travel to or through.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Before you travel, contact the nearest [embassy or consulate](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/23) for details on entry requirements .

#### Other formalities

[Children travelling alone](/before-you-go/who-you-are/children "Travelling with children") must have a letter of consent from a parent. If a child is travelling with one of their parents, a letter of consent isn't needed.

Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of the Czech Republic](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/54) for more information.

#### Registering accommodation

If you're staying in private accommodation for more than 3 days, you must register with the local Foreigner's Police Branch. If you don't register, you could be fined.

To register, take your:

* passport
* evidence of your health insurance
* completed [Registration of Accommodation](http://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/third-country-nationals-application-requirements-application-forms.aspx) form (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic)

Check if registration is part of the check-in process at your paid accommodation.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You could receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The currency of the Czech Republic is the Koruna (CZK). Payments by card are common and accepted in most places.

Change money at official marked exchange offices such as banks and exchange bureaus.

Declare any foreign currency valued at 10,000 euros or more if you're travelling between the Czech Republic and any non-EU country. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

If you don't declare, or if you give wrong information, authorities will fine you.

You should check with local authorities in the countries you are leaving, entering or passing through whether you must declare higher amounts of currency.

#### Local travel

Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the [Schengen Area](/before-you-go/basics/visas-and-entry-requirements-europe-and-schengen-area "Visas and entry requirements in Europe and the Schengen Area").

To stay up to date on border conditions:

* check local media
* ask transport providers

#### Driving permit

You need to be at least 18 years old to drive.

To drive, you'll need either:

* a local or EU driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Check if your licence is valid with the [Ministry of Transportation](https://www.mdcr.cz/Dokumenty/Silnicni-doprava/Ridicske-prukazy,Autoskoly/Popis-ridicskeho-prukazu-stanoveny-Umluvou-o-silni) (Czech).

#### Road travel

Speed is the main cause of road accidents and road deaths.

Roads in rural areas may be poorly maintained.

Always keep car headlights on.

You need a motorway sticker (vignette) for your car to travel on major highways. You can buy the sticker at petrol stations.

It's illegal to drive under the influence of any alcohol or drugs in the Czech Republic.

#### Motorcycles

Always wear a helmet.

Only use a motorbike if you have a motorcycle licence.

Check with your travel insurer to see if your policy covers motorcycles.

#### Taxis

Some taxi drivers refuse to use taxi meters and can overcharge.

Don't hail taxis on the street.

Use a Fair Place Taxi stand or call for an official taxi. Confirm with the driver that the taxi meter is running.

#### Public transport

Keep your ticket until the end of your journey. Show it to the inspector if asked.
