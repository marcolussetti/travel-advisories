### Safety

* Petty crime is common in Prague, including passport theft. Be wary of strangers who offer help or ask to see your passport. Only use ATMs in secure places, such as banks, shops and shopping centres. Never leave your belongings unattended in public places or on transportation.
* Drink spiking can happen. Keep an eye on your food and drink. Stay with people you trust in bars and nightclubs.
* Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent. Avoid demonstrations and crowds.
* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. ​Be alert, especially in places known to be possible targets.
