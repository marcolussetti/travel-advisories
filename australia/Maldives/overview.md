## Overview

### Safety

* The sea around the Maldives can have strong tidal currents and rips, and many tourists drown every year. Safety information may not be available at beaches. Where present, obey lifeguard warnings and take appropriate precautions.
* Protests and demonstrations can occur in Malé and non-resort islands. Avoid protests and demonstrations, even if they appear calm and peaceful and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Terrorism can occur anywhere at any time. Terrorists may target areas visited by tourists. Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Drug-related crime and gang-related violence occurs in urban areas, including Malé. Petty theft happens on beaches and in hotel rooms. Leave your valuables in a secure location. Monitor local media to avoid trouble spots.
* The monsoon season is from mid-May to November. Strong winds, rough seas and torrential rain can occur. Tsunamis can also occur. Keep in contact with friends and family. Follow the advice of local authorities.

### Health

* Insect-borne diseases are a risk, including dengue, Zika virus and chikungunya. Use tropical strength insect repellent.
* Hepatitis is a risk. Boil drinking water or drink bottled water.
* Rabies may be present in wildlife, particularly bats. Avoid contact with animals.
* Medical services, including emergency services and decompression chambers, are limited. It can take several hours to reach medical facilities. If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. This can be very expensive.

### Local laws

* It's illegal to publicly observe any religion other than Islam, which dictates laws that may not be obvious.
* It's illegal to import pornography, alcohol or pork products; however, alcohol and pork may be consumed on resort islands.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include life imprisonment.
* Outward displays of affection are not tolerated, and standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in Malé and non-resort islands. Dress modestly in Malé and non-resort islands. This includes while swimming. Take care not to offend.
* Serious crimes, such as murder, can attract the death penalty.
* It's illegal to export tortoiseshell and coral; be aware of the source of souvenirs. Drone flying may be illegal or banned. Check with your resort, as it may be classed as an invasion of privacy.
