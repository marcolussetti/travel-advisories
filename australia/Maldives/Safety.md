# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people may occur in greater Malé and inhabited islands, and can turn violent. Avoid affected areas and follow the advice of local authorities.

To stay safe during periods of unrest:

* avoid all protests and large public gatherings
* monitor the media for planned or possible unrest
* obey curfews and seek local advice on safety and security
* follow the instructions of security personnel and local authorities

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

Terrorism can occur anywhere in Maldives at any time. Possible targets include government institutions and tourist areas.

To reduce your risk of being involved in a terrorist attack:

* avoid crowded areas
* always be alert
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media and other sources.

Since February 2020, there have been terrorist attacks, including a stabbing attack on three foreigners in Hulhumalé, where an Australian was injured. Other incidents include an arson attack on a police speedboat in Laamu Gan in March 2020 and the detonation of an improvised explosive device in Malé in May 2021, which injured a high-profile politician and bystanders.

#### Crime

Drug-related crime occurs in greater Malé and inhabited islands in Maldives.

Gang-related violence, including knife crime, has increased in urban areas, including greater Malé, and Addu.

There is an ongoing risk of petty crime in Maldives, including pickpocketing and bag snatching. Be careful of theft in crowds and these locations:

* beaches
* markets
* hotels and guesthouses

To protect yourself from petty theft:

* carry only what you need
* leave valuables, including your passport, in a secure location
* follow local media for new security risks
* avoid trouble spots

Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Tours and adventure activities

The sea around the Maldives can have strong tidal currents and rips, and many tourists drown every year. Safety information may not be available at beaches. Where present, obey lifeguard warnings and take appropriate precautions. 

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance guidelines and these generally fall below Australian standards. This includes adventure activities, such as water sports.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* check the operator credentials and safety equipment before you book
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

#### Climate and natural disasters

The monsoon season is from mid-May to November. Strong winds, rough seas, torrential rain, and flash flooding can happen.

If there is a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") or [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident"):

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location, or always carry it on you (in a waterproof bag)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* monitor the media and other sources
* keep in contact with friends and family
* consult your tour operator about disruptions to your travel plans

[Tsunamis](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters) can occur in Maldives. Nearby or distant earthquakes cause these. Know your accommodation's evacuation plan and local evacuation points. 

Follow the advice of your resort or local authorities if you:

* feel a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up
* feel a weak, rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more
* see a sudden rise or fall in sea level
* hear loud and unusual noises from the sea

Don't wait for official warnings, such as alarms or sirens. If possible, move away from the beach to a higher place and monitor local media.

If you're on a boat at sea during a tsunami, this may be a safe place to remain until further advised.
