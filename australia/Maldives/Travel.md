#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You can get a free tourist visa on arrival to Maldives, provided you meet all entry requirements. Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the [Department of Immigration and Emigration of the Republic of Maldives](http://www.immigration.gov.mv/) for details about visas, currency, customs, and quarantine rules. Fake websites exist requesting payment for visas. 

Fines for exceeding your visa are expensive and you will not be able to leave Maldives until the fine is paid.

#### Border measures

Airlines may require proof of certain vaccinations to travel. Check requirements with individual airlines prior to travel. You must complete a [Traveller Declaration](https://imuga.immigration.gov.mv/traveller) form within 96 hours before arrival in Maldives. The Airline may ask for a copy of this declaration.

Tourists must have a confirmed booking at a registered tourist facility before entering Maldives.

#### Other formalities

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate to enter Maldives if you're coming from a country with a risk of yellow fever. Some airlines may want to see one when you leave.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible.

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Maldivian Rufiyaa (MVR).

You can change money at resorts, though many will accept $US. You can also change money and use ATMs at banks in Malé and many larger islands.

Carry cash if you're travelling to other areas.

Most hotels and major tourist facilities accept credit cards.

Before you travel, ask your bank if your cards will work in Maldives.

#### Local travel

Travel between islands is by boat or plane/seaplane.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Maldives, you'll need both:

* a valid International Driving Permit (IDP)
* a current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)

If you drive without an IDP, you may not be covered by your travel or vehicle insurance.

#### Road travel

Heavy congestion and road traffic accidents are common in greater Malé (Malé and Hulhumalé). Pedestrians and those travelling on motorcycles are at high risk of accidents. Follow road safety regulations and always stay alert.

#### Motorcycles

Check with your travel insurer to see if you're covered to use a motorbike.

Always wear a helmet.

Most helmets you can buy or rent in Maldives don't meet Australian standards.

#### Taxis and water taxis

Only use licensed taxis. Ask your hotel to arrange taxi or airport transfers.

Many resorts operate water taxis between the airport and other islands.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.

#### Public transport

[Public transport](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/public-transport) is available on larger inhabited (non-resort) islands.

Ferries operate between major islands.

Contact your hotel for details.
