#### Travel Insurance

Ensure you have comprehensive [travel insurance](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/the-basics/insurance).

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in [Maldives](https://health.gov.mv/en). Take enough legal medicine for your trip and consider bringing an extra supply in case your trip is unexpectedly extended.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

There is a risk of insect-borne diseases in Maldives. These include:

* [dengue](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/dengue-virus-infection )
* [Zika virus](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-factsheet-basics.htm)
* [chikungunya](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya)

Zika virus is a risk to pregnant women. Read the Australian Department of Health's [Zika virus bulletin](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-countries.htm) for advice on how to reduce your risk.

If you're pregnant:

* discuss travel plans with your doctor
* consider deferring non-essential travel to affected areas

To protect yourself against insect bites:

* ensure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use tropical strength mosquito and insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other diseases are common. These include:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19?language=und)

Serious outbreaks sometimes occur.

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with intact seals
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads

Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

Rabies may be present in wildlife, particularly bats. Avoid contact with animals.

#### Medical care

Hospital services, including rescue and emergency services, are limited.

There are three hospitals in Greater Malé (Malé, Hulhumalé, Villimalé). They all offer a large range of specialist services. 

It can take several hours to reach a hospital from resort islands.

Facilities are limited for scuba-diving injuries. While increasing, there are limited decompression chambers in Maldives. It may take several hours to reach these in an emergency. Dive within safety limits.

You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
