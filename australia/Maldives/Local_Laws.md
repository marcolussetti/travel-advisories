# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for carrying or using illegal drugs are severe and can include mandatory jail sentences and life imprisonment.

If you're caught with even a small amount of illegal drugs, you can be charged with trafficking.

#### Other laws

The death penalty can apply for serious crimes, such as murder.

In Maldives it's illegal to:

* import alcohol or pork products — see [Maldives Customs](https://www.customs.gov.mv/Individuals/Travellers/Travel-Prohibited-and-Restricted-Items-for-Import)
* consume alcohol or pork products — unless you're on a resort island
* import pornography
* It's illegal to export tortoiseshell and coral. Be aware of the source of souvenirs
* Drone flying may be illegal or banned. Check with your resort, as it may be classed as an invasion of privacy

#### Religion

It is illegal to:

* publicly observe any religion other than Islam
* import non-Islamic religious material

#### LGBTQIA+ travellers

In greater Malé and inhabited islands, Islamic concepts of modesty are observed. Public displays of same-sex affection are not welcomed.

Same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Maldives and same sex couples are not recognised. However, LGBTQIA+ travellers should not encounter any problems in greater Malé and inhabited islands unless there are outward displays of affection.

Resort islands are more tolerant of public displays of same-sex affection.

#### Non-resorts islands

A permit is not required to visit a non-resort island.

Provided you have entered Maldives with a valid visa, you have permission to travel to any part of the country.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Local customs

#### Dress and behaviour

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in most parts of Maldives, where Islamic concepts of modesty are observed. Take care not to offend. Public displays of affection (same-sex and opposite sex) are generally not welcomed in greater Malé and inhabited islands. Dress modestly in greater Malé and inhabited islands (covering shoulders and knees for women).

Many local islands have a “bikini beach”, where tourists can swim wearing their preferred swimwear. Wear modest swimwear if swimming on a “local” beach. Police may be called to escort people wearing inappropriate swimwear away from local swimming areas.

Standards of dress and behaviour are much less restrictive at resorts.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events) is observed in Maldives. Respect religious and cultural customs especially at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. Some restaurants and guesthouses on local islands will provide services for tourists, generally in more private settings. Seek local advice to avoid offence.

Resort islands generally don't need to follow the rules of Ramadan.
