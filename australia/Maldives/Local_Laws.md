# Local Laws

#### Local Law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for carrying or using illegal drugs are severe and can include mandatory jail sentences and life imprisonment.

If you're caught with even a small amount of illegal drugs, you can be charged with trafficking.

#### Other laws

The death penalty can apply for serious crimes, such as murder.

In Maldives it's illegal to:

* consume alcohol or pork products — unless you're on a resort island
* import pornography
* It's illegal to export tortoiseshell and coral. Be aware of the source of souvenirs
* Drone flying may be illegal or banned. Check with your resort, as it may be classed as an invasion of privacy

A permit is no longer required to visit a non-resort island.

#### Local customs

#### Dress and behaviour

Standards of dress and behaviour are conservative in most parts of Maldives. Take care not to offend. Public displays of affection are not tolerated on Malé and non-resort islands.

Dress modestly in Malé (covering shoulders and knees for women) and on non-resort islands. This includes swimming.

Standards of dress and behaviour can be less restrictive at resorts.

#### Ramadan

The Islamic holy month of [Ramadan](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/major-events) is observed in Maldives. Respect religious and cultural customs especially at this time.

During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking may be illegal in public during the day. If you're not fasting, avoid these activities around people who are. 

Resort islands generally don't need to follow the rules of Ramadan, though guesthouses on non-resort local islands will. Seek local advice to avoid offence.
