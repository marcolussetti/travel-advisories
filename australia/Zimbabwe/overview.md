## Overview

### Safety

* The security situation can be unpredictable. There may be food, water, medicine and fuel shortages, sometimes at short notice. Essential services, such as the electricity supply, can be unreliable. Communication networks can also be weak and unreliable.
* Demonstrations and protests in Zimbabwe can be volatile and may turn violent quickly. Avoid activities that could be considered political and stay away from demonstrations and protests. During periods of unrest, monitor local media, avoid affected areas and follow advice from local authorities.
* Violent crime, such as assault and armed robbery, occurs. The risk increases at night, in city centres and open areas such as parks and fields. Keep your accommodation locked, even when you're in it. Don't walk at night. Petty crime, such as mugging and bag snatching, is common. Don't carry bags that are easy to snatch.
* Land confiscation, wildlife poaching and violence against farmers have caused unrest. Get up-to-date security advice before you visit national parks, game farms, lodges or hunting areas.
* Theft from vehicles is common. Thieves target cars stopped at intersections, especially on the way to and from Harare Airport. Minimise the amount of time you remain stationary. Approach red lights slowly. Keep vehicle doors locked and windows up.
* Flooding and extreme weather can occur during the rainy season from November to April. Roads and other infrastructure damaged by flooding and extreme weather can take many years to be repaired.

### Health

* Malaria is a risk everywhere in Zimbabwe except in Harare and Bulawayo. Consider taking anti-malarial medication or other preventative measures. Other parasitic and insect-borne diseases that occur include filariasis and schistosomiasis. Ensure your accommodation is insect-proof. Use insect repellent.
* The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is very high. Take precautions if you're engaging in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.
* Outbreaks of foodborne, waterborne, and other infectious diseases also occur. These include typhoid, hepatitis, tuberculosis and cholera. Drink only boiled or bottled water. Avoid raw or undercooked food. Ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date. Don't swim in lakes and rivers due to the risk of waterborne diseases.
* The standard of medical facilities is generally poor to average. Outside of Harare and Bulawayo, facilities are even more basic. Public hospitals, including in Harare, suffer from serious shortages. You may need medical evacuation from Zimbabwe if you're seriously ill or injured. Ensure your travel insurance covers this.
