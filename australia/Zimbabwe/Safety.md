# Safety

#### Civil unrest and political tension

The security situation can be unpredictable. Unemployment is high, the economy is unstable, and the high crime rate is increasing.

Sometimes there are shortages of medical supplies, basic goods and food.

Essential services such as power, water and transport are unreliable. There are frequent and sometimes long power outages. Water rationing occurs in some parts of the country.

In some areas of Zimbabwe, issues causing unrest include:

* land confiscation
* people forced off their land
* crop looting
* cattle theft
* wildlife poaching
* violence against farmers, their families and workers

Demonstrations and protests in Zimbabwe can be volatile and may turn violent quickly. Avoid activities that could be considered political including political discussions in public places and online. Stay away from protests and demonstrations.

During periods of unrest:

* monitor the media for potential demonstrations or protests
* avoid affected areas
* follow advice from local authorities

#### Crime

There's a high risk of theft and other crime.

Petty crime is common, especially in urban and tourist areas. Dangers include:

* mugging
* bag-snatching
* carjacking
* pickpocketing

Violent crimes, such as armed robbery and [assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crime/assaulted), also occur. People known to be storing large sums of cash are sometimes targeted.

The risk of crime increases:

* at night
* on city streets and in city centres
* at street intersections
* near bridges
* around parks
* in open fields
* when leaving banks and ATMs.

Robberies may happen during the day, particularly in crowded urban areas.

To help protect yourself from violent crime:

* avoid carrying bags that are easy to snatch
* always lock doors, windows and gates at your accommodation
* travel with other people, or preferably a tour group
* avoid walking after dark
* don't carry or display large amounts of cash

Get immediate medical help if you're a victim of violent crime, especially [sexual assault](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/sexual-assault). The risk of HIV/AIDS is high, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) HIV medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Other crime

Theft from vehicles is common.

Thieves target cars stopped at intersections. In Harare, remain alert on the way to and from the airport and along Churchill, Borrowdale, and Masvingo-Beitbridge roads.

Thieves also slash the tyres of cars parked or stopped in traffic. When someone stops to change their tyre, thieves rob them.

You could be robbed while visiting national parks. Safari operators may ask you to show proof of indemnity insurance.

Get updates on the security situation before you visit:

* national parks
* farms, game farms, lodges and hunting areas

Lodges and camps in national parks can be isolated and remote. Options to travel to them may be limited.

If travelling by car:

* keep your doors locked, windows up and valuables hidden, even when moving
* be aware of people near your vehicle
* stop as little as possible, approach red lights slowly and plan ahead when you approach residential gates
* leave road space in front of your car in case you need to move away quickly

#### Scams and fraud

Commercial fraud, money transfer and employment scams are increasing.

#### Limited police services

Police have limited resources, including vehicles and fuel. They may ask to be driven from a police station to a crime scene.

Police processes can be slow and complicated when recovering property or prosecuting offenders.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you’re connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions, or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Tours and adventure activities

Transport and tour operators don't always follow safety and maintenance standards. This is important for adventure activities, such as rafting, bungee jumping and other adventure sports.

If you plan to do an [adventure activity](/before-you-go/activities/adventure "Going overseas for sports and adventure"):

* check if your travel insurance policy covers it
* see if your operator is registered
* ask about and insist on minimum safety requirements
* always use available safety gear, such as life jackets or seatbelts

If proper safety equipment isn't available, use another provider.

Carry your passport in a waterproof bag. Authorities may not accept a damaged passport.

Respect wildlife laws and keep a safe and legal distance when watching wildlife. Only use reputable guides or tour operators. Follow park regulations and warden’s advice.

#### Swimming safety

Swimming in lakes and rivers is unsafe.

You risk:

* attacks by wildlife
* catching waterborne diseases, such as [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis), (see '[Health](#health)')

#### Climate and natural disasters

Zimbabwe experiences [severe weather](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident).

The rainy season is from November to April. Flooding can occur.

If there's a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") you should:

* prepare for disruptions to services
* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources
* register with the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org/) to receive alerts
* do what local authorities say
* keep in touch with your friends and family
