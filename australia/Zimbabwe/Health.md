#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/node/149) before you leave. 

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Zimbabwe. Take enough legal medicine for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

[Malaria](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) is a risk everywhere except in Harare and Bulawayo.

Mosquitoes also spread other diseases, including [filariasis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis).

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing
* consider taking medicine to prevent malaria

Get medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

The rate of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) infection is high.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that put you at risk of infection.

If you’re the victim of a violent crime, including rape, see a doctor immediately.

#### Other health risks

Serious outbreaks of other waterborne, foodborne and infectious diseases sometimes occur, including:

* [bilharzia (schistosomiasis)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schistosomiasis)
* [typhoid](https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/typhoid )
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1 )
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [measles](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [cholera](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/cholera)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19)
* [mpox](https://www.cdc.gov.au/topics/mpox-monkeypox)

Water shortages have driven some people to use unsafe water sources.

To protect yourself from illness:

* keep your vaccinations up to date ([Immunisation for travel](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/immunisation-for-travel))
* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid raw and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid contact with dogs and other mammals

If you're bitten or scratched by an animal, get medical help straight away.

To avoid waterborne diseases, don't swim in freshwater lakes or rivers.

Get medical help if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

#### Medical facilities

Health services are poor.

Medical facilities are generally of a poor standard. Some private medical facilities in the larger cities are of average standard. Outside of Harare and Bulawayo, facilities are even more limited. Some medical supplies and prescription medications may not be available.

Public hospitals in Harare and other towns have shortages of:

* staff
* water
* power
* medicine
* equipment

They may not treat patients with certain illnesses. They may not be able to help in an accident or emergency.

You may need to pay up-front before receiving treatment, even in an emergency.

You may need to be evacuated if you become seriously ill or injured. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Ensure you have appropriate travel insurance.
