#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to enter Zimbabwe. A 30-day tourist visa (single or multiple entry) is available on arrival for a fee. You can apply for 2 consecutive extensions from within Zimbabwe (maximum stay is 90-days) at any Zimbabwean Department of Immigration Office.

Don't overstay a visa. Penalties (including jail) may apply. To extend a visa on arrival, apply online through the [Department of Immigration](http://www.zim.gov.zw/index.php/en/news-room/latest-news/228-sectors/360-immigration-and-visas) or in person at an immigration office. Allow enough time for an extension review.

You can also apply for a double-entry tourist visa, valid for 30 days from each entry date.

Alternatively, you may be eligible for a KAZA UniVisa that allows multiple entries in 30 days:

* between Zimbabwe and Zambia
* to Botswana for day trips

You can get a KAZA UniVisa at:

* Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls airports
* Victoria Falls land border (Zambia)
* Kazungula land border (Zambia/Botswana)
* A KAZA UniVisa can't be extended. Its availability can change at short notice.

#### Other visas and permits

You must apply for a permit before arriving in Zimbabwe to:

* live
* work
* study
* invest
* do business

Volunteering and missionary activities are considered work. You will require a business visa to engage in these activities.

The Zimbabwe Chief Immigration Officer must approve the permit.

Be careful using local migration agents. It's better to get visas, and work permits yourself.

To arrange a visa or work permit, apply:

* on the [Department of Immigration](http://www.zim.gov.zw/index.php/en/news-room/latest-news/228-sectors/360-immigration-and-visas) website
* through your sponsor
* at your nearest Zimbabwean Department of Immigration office

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact an [embassy or consulate of Zimbabwe](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/222) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

Your options for leaving Zimbabwe may be limited if security deteriorates quickly. Keep your documents up to date. You'll need a valid passport, visa, and vehicle police clearance if leaving via a land border.

#### Other formalities

#### Health screening

As part of health screening measures, you may have your temperature checked at points of entry into Zimbabwe.

#### Yellow fever vaccination

You need a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate if you're arriving from a country with yellow fever.

#### Entry stamp

When you arrive, check you get a legible entry stamp in your passport. Immigration officials will ask to see it when you leave.

#### Travel with an emergency travel document

If you're using an emergency travel document, you may need to show a police report to prove your passport was lost or stolen.

#### Working as a journalist

You must have proper accreditation to work as a journalist. Without this, you can be arrested and detained or deported.

#### Travel via South Africa

Strict rules apply to children aged under 18 years travelling through South Africa. South African authorities do not accept provisional travel documents. They do accept Australian emergency passports. Check our [travel advice for South Africa](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/south-africa).

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport isn't valid for more than 6 months.

Ensure you have 3 blank pages in your passport in case you need to enter Zimbabwe and exit through one of the neighbouring countries or if you need to leave at short notice.

If travelling to multiple African countries on one trip, ensure you have enough blank pages to accommodate the requirements of all countries you plan to visit.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a [new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X’ gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Zimbabwe’s economic situation is unpredictable. In April 2024, Zimbabwe announced the introduction of a new currency, Zimbabwe Gold ($ZWG), to replace the Zimbabwe dollar ($ZWL).

The US dollar is widely accepted, but this could change without notice. Prices can be listed in either currency. Check before making a transaction, as the $ symbol can be used for both currencies. The exchange rate between the local currency and USD can change quickly. Most stores and businesses will not accept US banknotes issued before 2006.

Zimbabwe is experiencing a cash crisis. Authorities have introduced restrictions. You may not be able to withdraw cash from an ATM with an international debit/credit card. International debit/credit cards are not widely accepted. Bank fees are high, including when withdrawing from ATMs. ATMs are available in the main cities but may not accept international cards.

Take enough cash to cover your stay. Changing money anywhere except at officially licensed banks and bureaux de change is illegal. If possible, carry small denominations. Most vendors prefer $US in cash and may be unable to provide change if you pay in $US.

Check if your hotels and other providers (including medical providers) will accept international credit cards. Many businesses only have point-of-sale machines that accept local credit and debit cards. Many companies charge a fee to use a credit card.

It's illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than $US2,000 in cash or the same amount in a different currency. The amount can change with little or no notice.

#### Local travel

#### Essential services

Disruptions to power and water are common and can last for weeks, including in cities. Mobile phone reception and data can also be unreliable.

#### Landmines

Parts of the country have unexploded landmines, mainly in:

* the border area with Mozambique
* the Lupane District in Matabeleland North Province

The Zimbabwe Government has a national program to locate and remove landmines.

Stick to main roads and paths in areas where landmines could exist.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Zimbabwe, you need both:

* a valid Australian driver's licence
* an International Driving Permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before leaving Australia.

#### Road travel

Road travel is very dangerous in Zimbabwe.

Hazards include:

* traffic lights which often don't work
* crowded intersections
* reckless and dangerous driving habits
* poorly maintained roads full of potholes in both city and country areas
* unmarked speed humps
* poorly maintained vehicles, including a high number of commuter vans overburdened and unroadworthy by Australian standards
* roadblocks requiring detours
* poor or no street lighting or signage
* unlit or poorly lit vehicles at night
* animals on roads

Flash flooding during the rainy season can make roads, including in major cities, impassable from November to March.

#### Driving laws

All vehicles must carry the following:

* a fire extinguisher
* 2 metallic emergency triangles with white reflective stickers on the front and red reflective stickers on the back
* a spare wheel
* wheel spanner
* a jack

If your vehicle isn't fully equipped, authorities could fine you.

It's illegal to use a phone without a hands-free device when driving.

#### Local driving

Fuel shortages can occur. Keep your tank topped up and carry sufficient fuel for long journeys. You may need to check if international credit/debit cards will be accepted when purchasing fuel.

If you plan to drive:

* check your insurance covers you and your vehicle
* learn local traffic laws and practices
* ask locally about fuel availability and road conditions, such as security risks and road closures not only in Zimbabwe but in any bordering provinces of neighbouring countries that you may cross into

If you hire a vehicle, make sure it's equipped with all compulsory safety equipment.

While driving:

* take a mobile phone or another communication device with you
* carry a medical kit
* always be alert to possible hazards
* avoid travelling on roads outside of major centres at night due to limited lighting and poor road conditions
* avoid rural roads at night
* do what local authorities say, including at roadblocks

#### Motorcades

By law, all vehicles must stop and pull over when an official motorcade goes past. You must stop even if you're on the opposite side of the road on a dual carriageway.

Security forces sometimes intimidate motorists who don't abide with this requirement or pull over in time.

#### Roadblocks

Police roadblocks can appear with little warning. If asked, you must show police your identification documents, car registration and ownership papers.

Police may also ask to see your car's safety equipment.

Police may ask drivers to pay on-the-spot fines or a bribe. If you pay a bribe, they could demand more.

#### Motorcycles

Check if your travel insurance policy covers you for the vehicle you intend to ride. You might need extra cover for an accident on a motorbike, quad bike or similar vehicle.

Always wear a helmet.

#### Taxis

Use only registered taxis and limousines. If possible, book them through your accommodation.

#### Public transport

Avoid using public transport, buses and commuter buses (combis). They present safety concerns due to overcrowding, poor maintenance and reckless driving.

#### Boat travel

Accidents have occurred on passenger [ferries and boats](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/getting-around/boat-travel).

Use transport providers with a good reputation.

Always wear a life jacket, even if others don't.

#### Air travel

Airlines can change or cancel flights at short notice. You can book charter flights through private companies.

The European Union (EU) has banned Air Zimbabwe flights to the EU. Australian Embassy staff are not permitted to use Air Zimbabwe for official travel except in exceptional circumstances.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths.

Check [Zimbabwe's air safety profile](https://asn.flightsafety.org/asndb/country/Z) with the Aviation Safety Network.

#### Hunting

Zimbabwe has hunting rules.

Risks include landmines in some areas.

If you plan to do guided hunting, engage an operator with a good reputation and a valid hunting licence.

Before you hunt, research the rules and requirements of the [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)](https://www.cites.org/eng).
