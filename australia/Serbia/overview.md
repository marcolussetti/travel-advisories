## Overview

### Safety

* Terrorism is a threat worldwide. Terrorists have staged attacks in European cities. Targets have included public transport,  transport hubs, and public places popular with tourists.
* Protests are common in Belgrade and other towns and cities across Serbia and can disrupt transport and other essential services. Avoid protests and large gatherings as they may turn violent. Foreigners have been detained after attending protests. Monitor local media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities.
* The area of Southern Serbia bordering Kosovo has unexploded landmines. Only use well-known roads and paths.
* Violent attacks sometimes occur near nightclubs. Targeted bomb attacks and gun violence can occur. Many Serbians own guns. Be alert to suspicious behaviour and avoid trouble spots.
* Earth tremors and flooding can occur. Bushfires happen in summer. Snow and ice can be a danger in winter. Monitor the media for updates.

### Health

* Medical facilities are below Australian standards. If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be evacuated. Make sure your insurance covers this.
