#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You don't need a visa for tourist visits of up to 90 days in a 6-month period. This applies from the date of the first entry.

You'll need a visa for other situations.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest [embassy or consulate of Serbia](https://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/diplomatic-missions/serbian-diplomatic-missions/embassies) for details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules.

#### Kosovo-Serbia border

The security situation along the Kosovo-Serbia border is volatile.

Don't attempt to enter Serbia from Kosovo unless you first travelled to Kosovo from Serbia.

You'll need a valid, recent Serbian entry stamp in your passport to travel from Kosovo to Serbia. You'll have to enter Serbia from another country if you don't.

Serbia can deny entry if you have any border entry or exit stamps from Kosovo in your passport. In practice, this does not occur often. Still, the Serbian border police will cancel the Kosovo entry/exit records by stamping over them.

Political violence has broken out many times at the border crossings of:

* Jarinje, also known as Gate 1
* Brnjak, also known as Gate 31

Be cautious travelling in the Kosovo border area. See [Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/serbia?#safety)

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

Serbia's currency is the Serbian Dinar (RSD). You can't change it outside Serbia.

On arrival, you'll need to declare currency and valuables with 10,000 euros or equivalent value. Valuables may include:

* laptops
* cameras
* jewellery

Make sure you get a copy from customs officials. You'll need the declaration form when you leave Serbia.

They could be taken away if you don't declare your currency or valuables.

Most banks in towns and cities have ATMs that accept international bank cards.

ATMs only dispense Serbian Dinar.

Traveller's cheques aren't widely accepted. However, larger branches of some banks will cash them.

#### Local travel

#### Border crossings

Border crossings close at short notice. Delays and disruptions to cross-border transport are possible. Delays and strict controls at the border are common, especially in the European summer.

To stay safe:

* avoid large groups near borders
* have back-up plans
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Driving permit

To drive, you'll need both:

* a current Australian driver's licence (digital driver's licences may not be accepted)
* a valid international driving permit (IDP)

Get your IDP before you leave Australia.

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous due to poorly maintained vehicles and roads and poor driving habits.

It's dangerous to drive after bad weather.

Drivers and pedestrians frequently ignore road rules.

In rural areas, pedestrians and farm animals sometimes share the roads.

Snow and ice are additional hazards in winter. Local authorities may not always clear roads after heavy snowfall.

It's illegal not to wear a seatbelt if one is available.

The blood alcohol limit for drivers is 0.03%.

Call 1987 for roadside assistance.

#### Taxis

Only use registered taxis and authorised limousines. Ask your hotel to arrange this for you.

Registered taxis have both a municipal registration number and a taxi number.

#### Public transport

Public transport is usually reliable, but it can be crowded. Standards vary.
