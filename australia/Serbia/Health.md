#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won't pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you'll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Serbia. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription or a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medicine is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use only

#### Health risks

Air pollution levels can be high, especially in winter. Heavy smoke from coal and wood-burning heaters can stay in the air.

Accidental release of toxic matter from factories is common.

Authorities don't always issue public health warnings.

If you have asthma or other breathing difficulties, speak to your doctor before travelling.

#### Tick-borne encephalitis

There's a risk of [tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) in forests and fields.

Ticks are common in country areas. They are active from spring to autumn.

Take measures to avoid tick bites, particularly in rural areas.

During and after visiting a forest:

* check your body for ticks
* carefully remove any whole ticks as soon as possible
* be alert for any signs of infection

#### Insect-borne diseases

Cases of [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) are reported throughout Serbia. There's no vaccine to prevent it.

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof
* use insect repellent
* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

#### Other health risks

Outbreaks of foodborne and other infectious diseases happen from time to time. These include:

* [trichinosis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/trichinellosis/)/trichinellosis
* [brucellosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/brucellosis)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [measles](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/measles)

To protect yourself from illness, avoid the following:

* raw and under-cooked food, such as salads
* unpasteurised dairy products
* Get medical advice if you have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Serbia are below Australian standards.

If you're injured or become seriously ill, you'll need to be evacuated to a place with better facilities. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.

You must wear a face mask in health facilities.
