# Safety

#### Terrorism

Terrorist attacks could occur anywhere and at any time. 

In June, one person was killed in an attack outside of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade.

Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places. Terrorists may target tourist areas or other places frequented by foreigners, and where large crowds may gather.

Possible targets include:

* places of worship or religious holidays
* hotels, clubs, restaurants and cafes
* markets and shopping malls
* outdoor recreation events, including festivals, concerts, and sporting venues
* public transport, airports and railway hubs

To stay safe:

* report suspicious activities or items to the police
* check the media for new threats
* take official warnings seriously
* follow the instructions of local authorities

If there’s an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe to do so.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

#### Demonstrations and protests

Protests are common in Belgrade and other towns and cities across Serbia, which have increased regularly since November 2024. Protests have usually been peaceful but have caused major traffic and public transport disruptions. Protests can turn violent, and foreigners have been detained after attending protests.

Some sporting events have turned violent, injuring people and damaging property. There have been clashes between police and fans near sports venues and between fans of opposing teams. While foreigners aren't targets, there have been isolated incidents where the clashes have affected foreigners.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* monitor local media for updates
* avoid affected areas
* avoid crowds and stay indoors if possible
* be aware of your surroundings
* make contingency plans to leave or to shelter in place if leaving is impossible
* follow the advice of local authorities
* notify friends and family of your safety

#### Border control

The level of security at Serbian land borders can change without notice. The border with North Macedonia is an entry point for asylum seekers attempting to travel through Serbia to the EU. Delays and strict controls at the border are common, especially in the European summer.

To stay safe:

* avoid crowds in border areas
* always carry your passport at or near borders
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Kosovo-Serbia border

The Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. Serbia doesn't recognise Kosovo's independence.

Security along the border between Serbia and Kosovo can change quickly. Be cautious travelling in the Kosovo border area. The security situation can be unpredictable.

In the past, clashes between security forces and armed groups have happened:

* in the Presevo area of southern Serbia
* in the Bujanovac area of Southern Serbia
* at border points with Kosovo

Further unrest may occur at any time.

#### Unexploded weapons

The area of Southern Serbia bordering Kosovo has unexploded landmines and other remnants of war. Only use well-known roads or paths.

To stay safe in southern Serbia, only use well-known roads and paths and be alert to uncleared landmine warning signs.

#### Crime

#### Crime

Pickpocketing, bag snatching, and other petty crimes are common. Criminals often target foreigners in crowded places, such as markets and on public transport.

To reduce your risk of crime:

* pay close attention to your personal belongings, especially in crowds
* carry only what you need
* hold bags and backpacks in front of you

#### Violent crime

Violent criminal acts are usually linked to organised crime. They aren't directed at foreigners.

However, there have been several violent and fatal attacks against foreigners, particularly late at night:

* near nightclubs
* in bars
* in inner-city suburbs

Many Serbians own guns, and shootings happen. 

To protect yourself from violent crime:

* move away from dangerous situations
* monitor local media for updates
* avoid trouble spots
* be ready to leave quickly if trouble arises

#### Credit card fraud

Credit card fraud is common.

Only use ATMs in banks, shops and shopping centres.

Always take care to protect your card and PIN.

Be alert for suspicious behaviour.

To reduce your risk of fraud:

* avoid ATMs that open onto the street
* keep your credit card in sight during transactions

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping can happen anywhere, anytime, including in destinations that are typically at lower risk.  

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers.

#### Climate and natural disasters

Serbia experiences [natural disasters](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") and [severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident").

Severe [earthquakes](/before-you-go/safety/earthquakes-tsunamis "Earthquakes and tsunamis") are rare, but tremors are common.

[Flooding](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") can happen throughout the country, especially along the Sava River.

[Bush and forest fires](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") can occur in summer, from June to September, especially in southern Serbia.

Extreme hot and dry periods may lead to water shortages.

In winter, some parts of Serbia can experience extremely low temperatures from October to March. Snow and ice are hazards.

Monitor local media and weather reports. Plan ahead.

If there is a natural disaster or severe weather:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location or carry it in a waterproof bag
* keep in contact with family and friends
* monitor the media and other sources
* follow the advice of local authorities
