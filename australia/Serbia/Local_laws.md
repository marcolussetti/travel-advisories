# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter"). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe and include long prison terms in local jails.

It's illegal to photograph military and police:

* personnel
* buildings
* vehicles
* equipment

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual citizenship

Serbia recognises dual nationality.

Serbia abolished compulsory military service in 2011.

If you're an Australian-Serbian dual national, you could have military service duties from before this date.

Check with an [Embassy or Consulate of Serbia](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/Missions/176) before you travel.

If you're returning to Serbia after many years away, living conditions may be different to what you expect. Do your research before travelling.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships are legal but not widely accepted.

Verbal and physical aggression is sometimes directed towards the LGBTQIA+ community. Avoid public displays of affection.
