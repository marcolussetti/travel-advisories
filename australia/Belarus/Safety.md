# Safety

#### Security situation

If you're in Belarus, leave immediately using limited commercial options available or private means. The security environment in Belarus is volatile and could deteriorate quickly due to Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine, Russia's military presence along the Belarus border with Ukraine and the arbitrary enforcement of laws by Belarusian authorities. Russian forces are conducting military operations from Belarus, which has heightened regional tensions. Do not attempt to travel to the Belarus-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Belarus. 

If you decide to stay in Belarus, review your personal security plans. Expect restrictions on financial transactions and be aware you may be affected by shortages of essential products and services. You're responsible for your safety and that of your family.

#### Border areas

Do not travel to the Belarus-Ukraine border due to the risk of armed conflict. We advise you do not travel to Ukraine due to the volatile security environment and military conflict. Read the [Ukraine travel advice](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert) for more information.

Due to restrictions on movement and the volatile security environment, do not travel near borders with [Latvia](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/latvia), [Lithuania](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/lithuania) and [Poland](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/poland). Armed violence is possible at any time.

#### Leaving Belarus

You should immediately leave Belarus if it's safe to do so. Use your judgement to decide the best time and safest means of exit. Any travel options you take are at your own risk.

Transport routes may be disrupted. Plan for delays at land border crossings. Expect disruption to travel and changes at short notice. Ensure you have adequate food, water, medication, and fuel supply.

Read your [destination's](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) travel advice to ensure you meet the entry requirements. Minsk International Airport operates with international flights to limited destinations. Minsk airport and Belarusian land border operations could close without notice. Check before planning any border crossings. Be prepared for travel delays and disruptions. Several countries have banned Belarusian airlines from flying over their airspace, including all EU member states, the UK and Ukraine.

If, despite our advice, you decide to stay in Belarus:

* follow the instructions of authorities
* ensure your travel documents are up-to-date, and keep your passport and other travel documentation safe
* contact your family and friends in Australia so they're aware of your location and situation
* keep up to date with developments on the security situation and monitor reputable media, and regularly check our travel advice and [social media](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/about-us/social-media)
* review your personal security plans and make contingency plans to leave as soon as you judge it safe to do so
* always be alert and aware of your surroundings
* avoid large gatherings and areas with groups of fighters and military equipment.

#### Civil unrest and political tension

Large and local street demonstrations have occurred in Minsk and other cities in Belarus.

There have been casualties and protesters detained. Further demonstrations could occur without notice and turn violent. Harassment of foreigners is possible.

Avoid protests and follow the instructions of authorities.

Local authorities won't tolerate any opposition. They often make many arrests. 

Belarus imposes jail sentences for 'terrorism propaganda', 'discrediting' the Belarusian government, security forces and military organisations and extended the death penalty to include 'high treason'.

To protect yourself during periods of unrest:

* avoid areas of unrest
* obey the local authorities

#### Crime

Crimes against travellers include pickpocketing, [muggings and robberies](/before-you-go/safety/theft-robbery "Theft and robbery"). Take care on sleeper trains and in or near bars and hotels visited by foreigners.

People have reported harassment, mistreatment and extortion by police and other local officials.

Watch out for drink or food spiking. You're at higher risk of theft if you've been drugged. Drink spiking can happen anywhere. Be alert to the potential risks, and don't leave food or drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed. Stick to reputable venues and avoid homemade alcoholic drinks due to the risk of methanol poisoning. Get urgent medical help if you suspect you’ve been a victim.

#### Kidnapping

Kidnapping occurs across the world with political, ideological, and criminal motives. Foreigners, including Australians, have been kidnapped overseas whilst travelling. Kidnaps can happen anywhere, anytime, including destinations that are typically at lower risk.

If despite our advice, you travel to an area with a high risk of kidnapping our ability to provide consular assistance in these destinations is limited.    
   
You are responsible for your own safety. To reduce the risk of kidnapping:

* always be alert to your personal security and surroundings - avoid distractions. Be prepared to stop or take evasive action if you sense danger

* get professional security advice for travel in locations with a heightened kidnap risk. It is essential to have a contingency plan

* check your accommodation has appropriate security measures

* vary your movements so you don't set predictable patterns

* keep a low profile – including online. Drawing attention to yourself in high-risk areas may signal to criminals that you have something worth taking

* avoid isolated locations, particularly when travelling alone. There is safety in numbers, and you should try to travel with someone else, especially at night

* notify family or friends of planned travel; share your location and emergency contacts that they can rely on if something happens

* avoid talking about your money or business affairs

* use ATMs in public places and during daylight hours

* avoid giving personal details to strangers online or over the phone. Criminals have been known to search social media for victims

* If you are confronted by armed criminals, it is best to surrender and cooperate – resistance tends to make the situation worse

You can find more information on how to reduce your risk of kidnapping here: [Kidnapping](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/safety/kidnapping).

The Australian Government's longstanding policy is that it doesn't make payments or concessions to kidnappers. Ransom payments to kidnappers have funded further terrorist attacks and criminal activity. Ransom payments to terrorist groups are likely to contravene Australian counter-terrorism financing laws.

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or Bluetooth. 

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Terrorism

While there have been no recent terrorist attacks in Belarus, they can still happen.

Terrorists have staged attacks in other European cities in recent years. Targets include:

* airports
* public transport, including train stations
* government buildings, including schools
* places of worship
* public areas that attract large groups of people, such as concert halls, tourist attractions, sporting venues and shopping centres

If there's an attack, leave the area as soon as it's safe. Avoid the affected area in case of secondary attacks.

Terrorism is a threat worldwide.
