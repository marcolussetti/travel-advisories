# Overview

Latest update

We've reviewed the advice for Belarus and continue to advise do not travel to Belarus. The security environment continues to be volatile and could deteriorate at short notice.  
  
Belarus imposes strong penalties for very broadly defined and arbitrarily enforced offences such as 'terrorism propaganda' and 'discrediting' the Belarusian government, security forces and military organisations. Penalties may be severe, including the death penalty for ‘high treason’ under Belarusian law.  
  
Belarus doesn't recognise dual nationality. If you enter Belarus with a Belarusian passport, local authorities will treat you as a Belarusian national even if you're a dual national. This severely limits the consular services we can give if you're arrested or detained. Belarusians can't obtain or renew travel documents abroad. Dual citizens are at risk when renewing travel documents in Belarus and should obtain independent legal advice before travelling to or entering Belarus.  
  
If you're in Belarus, leave immediately using the limited commercial options available or private means. Review your personal security plans and carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. You're responsible for your safety and that of your family. Don't attempt to travel to the Belarus-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Belarus. The Australian government can't evacuate you from Belarus.

## Overview

### Safety

* Do not travel to Belarus due to the volatile security environment caused by Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine, Russia's military presence along Belarus' border with Ukraine and the arbitrary enforcement of laws by Belarusian authorities.
* Russia is conducting military operations from Belarus, and this has heightened tensions in the region. The security environment is volatile and could deteriorate at short notice. Do not attempt to travel to the Belarus-Ukraine border or cross into Ukraine from Belarus.
* If you're in Belarus, leave immediately using limited commercial options available or private means. Carefully consider the safest means and route to depart. Check the entry requirements of the [destination](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) you're entering. You're responsible for your safety and that of your family.
* If, despite our advice, you remain in Belarus, review your personal security plans. Expect restrictions on financial transactions and be aware you may be affected by shortages of essential products and services. For more information on what to do if you're caught in armed conflict, see our general advice ‘'[There's an armed conflict](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/theres-armed-conflict)’'.
* Large protests have occurred in Minsk and other cities in Belarus. Avoid demonstrations and follow the instructions of authorities. Harassment of foreigners is possible. You may not be able to trust the police and other local officials. People have reported harassment, mistreatment and extortion by officials. Do not travel near borders with Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to volatile security environment and border closures/restrictions on movement.

* Foodborne, waterborne and other diseases are common. Boil tap water or drink bottled water. Avoid ice cubes, unpasteurised dairy products, and raw and undercooked food.
* Healthcare standards in Belarus are below those of Australia. If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need medical evacuation. Make sure your travel insurance covers this.

### Local laws

* Belarus imposes strong penalties for very broadly defined and arbitrarily enforced offences such as 'terrorism propaganda' and 'discrediting' the Belarusian security forces – this includes the death penalty for 'high treason'. Religious freedoms are also restricted.
* Crimes, including murder, can also attract the death penalty. Penalties for drug offences are severe, including long prison sentences.
* Belarus doesn't recognise dual nationality. Belarusians cannot obtain or renew travel documents abroad. If you enter Belarus with a Belarusian passport, local authorities will treat you as a Belarusian national even if you're a dual national. This severely limits the [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services) we can give if you're arrested or detained. You're at risk when renewing your travel documents in Belarus, and dual citizens should obtain independent legal advice before travelling to or entering Belarus.
* Same-sex relationships are technically legal but are not widely accepted. In February 2024, Belarus prepared a draft law 'banning LGBT propaganda'. The law is awaiting approval and official confirmation.
* Law enforcement agencies in Belarus cooperate closely with agencies in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If you commit an offence in a CIS country or have engaged in activities that might broadly constitute an offence in any of the CIS countries, you may be detained in another (including at the border) and extradited for prosecution.
* Authorities can ask for ID at any time. Always carry your passport, original visa, and migration card. They will not accept copies.
* It's illegal to take photos of certain sites, buildings, monuments, and officials. Other rules or fees can apply to photography in public areas.

Confirm the entry requirements for your [destination](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations) before arrival.

* Flights to and from Belarus are extremely limited. Flight availability and travel routes could change or be disrupted at short notice. Several countries have banned the overflight of their airspace by Belarusian airlines, including all EU member states, the UK and Ukraine.
* Expect disruptions to travel and changes at short notice. Some roads may be crowded, exposed to military action or damaged. Make sure you have a supply of food, water, medication and fuel. Make sure your travel documents, including those of your family, are up-to-date.
