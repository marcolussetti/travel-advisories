# Local laws

#### Local law

You're subject to all local laws and penalties, including those that may appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian government will do what it can to help you under our [Consular Services Charter](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter). But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

#### Drugs

Penalties for drug offences are severe. They include long prison sentences.

#### Other laws

Always carry your passport, original visa, and migration card.

Authorities can ask for ID at any time. They can detain you if you don't have identification. Copies of ID aren't accepted.

Belarus has the death penalty for crimes including murder and 'attempted terrorism'.

Belarus imposes jail sentences for 'terrorism propaganda', 'discrediting' the Belarusian government, security forces and military organisations and extended the death penalty to include 'high treason'.

In Belarus, it's illegal to:

* drive with a blood alcohol level above zero
* conduct some religious activities, such as preaching, handing out literature and meeting with unregistered religious groups
* take photos of military sites, government buildings, monuments, and uniformed officials

Other rules or fees can apply for taking photographs in public areas.

#### Local customs

Same-sex relationships are technically legal but are not widely accepted. In February, Belarus prepared a draft law banning 'LGBTI propaganda'. The law is awaiting approval and official confirmation.

#### Australian laws

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

#### Dual nationality

Belarus doesn't recognise dual nationality.

If you enter Belarus with a Belarusian passport, local authorities will treat you as a Belarusian national even if you're a dual national. This severely limits the [consular services](/consular-services/consular-services-charter "Consular Services Charter") we can give if you're arrested or detained.

Any child born to a Belarusian parent is a Belarusian citizen, regardless of their place of birth.

By law, dual nationals must enter and exit the country using their Belarusian passport. Belarusians must obtain or renew travel their documents in Belarus. Dual nationals are at risk when renewing travel documents in Belarus and should obtain independent legal advice before travelling to or entering Belarus.
