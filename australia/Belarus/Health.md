#### Travel insurance

Most Australian travel insurance policies won't cover you for travel to Belarus. Do not travel to Belarus. See '[Safety](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/belarus#safety)'

If you're not insured, you may have to pay thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

#### Physical and mental health

Do not travel to Belarus. If, despite our advice, you travel to Belarus, consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition. 

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location*.*

#### Medications

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Belarus. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* your required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Tick-borne diseases

[Tick-borne encephalitis](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/) (World Health Organisation) and other tick-borne diseases are a risk, especially if you travel through forests.

Ticks are common in rural areas from April to October.

#### Radiation

Belarus opened the exclusion zone immediately around the Chornobyl site, which includes an area close to Ukraine's border in the southeast of Belarus.

Access to this part of the country may be limited and remains radioactive. Avoid tours to this area due to the radiation risk.

#### Other health risks

Foodborne, waterborne and other diseases are common, including these listed by the World Health Organization:

* [HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids)
* [tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis)
* [measles](https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/measles)
* [diphtheria](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diphtheria)
* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)
* [rabies](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies)
* [COVID-19](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/novel-coronavirus)

To protect yourself from illness:

* drink boiled water or bottled water with sealed lids
* avoid ice cubes
* avoid uncooked and undercooked food, such as salads
* avoid unpasteurised dairy products

Get medical advice if you suspect food poisoning or have a fever or diarrhoea.

#### Medical care

The standard of health care in Belarus is lower than in Australia. Doctors and hospitals will ask for insurance details or an up-front payment before treating you.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you'll need to be evacuated to get proper care. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
