#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visa-free entry for short stays

If, despite our advice, you travel to Belarus, you can get a 30-day visa-free entry valid only if you enter and exit through Minsk National Airport and Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel and Mogilev airports. More information can be found on the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus website](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmfa.gov.by%2Fen%2Fvisa%2Ffreemove%2Fairport%2F&data=04%7C01%7CDereta.Lennon%40dfat.gov.au%7C6be6aac8389c4a5c2d3d08d998659bb6%7C9b7f23b30e8347a58a40ffa8a6fea536%7C0%7C0%7C637708384435407114%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=RSmvRRELiHl7qovV02NizBadH77hB8rb9JEIZhDtisY%3D&reserved=0).

Visa-free entry does not apply to travellers coming from or travelling to Russia.

Other entry conditions apply, such as compulsory medical insurance.

#### Travel between Belarus and Russia

Do not travel to Belarus or Russia due to the security environment and impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If you're in Russia or Belarus, leave immediately using the limited commercial options available or private means if it's safe to do so.

If despite our advice, you decide to travel between Belarus and Russia, from January 2025, foreign travellers holding a Belarusian or Russian visa, and an ID document recognised in both countries may enter, leave, stay or transit through both countries via the assigned international checkpoints for the period of the visa validity.

More information can be found on the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus website](https://mfa.gov.by/en/press/news_mfa/e90f53f504e4694f.html).

#### Diplomatic or official passport

Different rules apply if you're travelling on a diplomatic or official passport. Contact the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus](https://mfa.gov.by/en/bilateral/belarus/) for details. 

#### Border measures

Authorities permit Australians to cross land borders through assigned border checkpoints for short visits to the areas of Augustov Canal, Belovezhskaya Pushcha and Brest (bordering Poland), and Grodno (bordering Poland and Lithuania).

If, despite our advice, you decide to travel to Belarus, travel with a registered tour operator and enter through assigned border checkpoints. Border checkpoints can close without warning. 

Check details about:

* [Grodno and the Augustov Canal visitors](https://grodnovisafree.by/en/how-to-come.html)
* [Brest foreign visitors](https://bezvizy.npbp.by/en/?step=1)

When you enter or exit Belarus, show the original visa issued to border authorities. They won't accept copies.

You may need to present a document with a notarized translation confirming the purpose of your visit to Belarus at the border.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. For details about visas, currency, customs and quarantine rules, contact:

* [Belarus Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/)
* [Republic of Belarus](https://www.belarus.by/en/)
* [State Customs Authorities of Belarus](http://www.customs.gov.by/en/)

#### Other formalities

#### Migration card

If, despite our advice, you travel to Belarus or Russia, you'll need to complete a migration card when you enter. One card covers both countries. 

If you don't get a card on your flight or train, ask the border control authorities for one.

Keep the stamped second half of the card. You'll need it when leaving the last country.

#### Medical insurance

You must have medical insurance to enter Belarus.

If you arrive without proof of insurance, you'll need to purchase a standard policy on entry. Check your insurance carefully to ensure you're covered in a 'do not travel' country.

Contact the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus](https://mfa.gov.by/en/) for details.

#### Currency and goods declaration

If, despite our advice, you decide to enter Belarus and arrive with cash or travellers cheques worth more than the equivalent of 10,000 USD, you'll need to complete a declaration form.

Any goods worth more than the equivalent of 500 EUR (and/or weighing more than 25 kg) for land border entry, and 10,000 EUR (and/or weighing more than 50 kg) for air border entry will also need to be declared and may incur customs duties.  

More details can be found on the [State Customs Authorities of Belarus website](https://www.customs.gov.by/fizicheskim-litsam/krasnyy-koridor/).

Ensure your completed form is stamped by a customs officer when you arrive.

Carry it during your visit and show it when you leave the country.

Undeclared money may be confiscated when you leave Belarus. You could also be fined.

#### Local registration

If, despite our advice, you plan to travel to Belarus and stay for more than 10 days, you must register either through the [Unified portal for electronic services](https://e-pasluga.by/en_US/services/visas-and-travel/20012141registration-of-a-foreign-citizen-or-stateless-person-temporarily-stayin) or through the citizenship and migration unit of the internal affairs body at your place of residence in Belarus. More details can be found on the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus website.](https://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/registration/)  

Registering is usually part of the check-in procedure if you stay in a hotel. Confirm this with your hotel.

If you don't register, you could be fined. You could face difficulties when leaving the country.

#### Exporting goods

Australia has [imposed measures against Belarus](https://www.dfat.gov.au/crisis-hub/invasion-ukraine-russia), including trade measures and targeted sanctions, in response to its support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Strict rules control the export of antiques, icons, and items of historic significance.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid long enough, consider getting [a new passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/).

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact the [Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you're overseas, contact the nearest [Australian embassy or consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

If your passport is stolen, you'll also need the following:

* an official police report
* a new Australian passport from the [Australian Embassy in Moscow](http://www.russia.embassy.gov.au/)
* a new exit visa from Belarusian authorities

You won't be able to leave Belarus without an original visa unless you're granted authorisation from the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Belarusian Ministry of Interior.

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Belarus Ruble (BYN).

If you’re travelling to Belarus, its important you speak to your Australian bank before you go. Because of sanctions against Belarus, your bank may block your card if you use it in Belarus. Not all international cards are accepted or can be used in Belarus. Many reputable international money transfer providers have suspended operations in Belarus.

It can be difficult to exchange Australian dollars for Belarusian rubles. Consider taking cash in US dollars or euros.

Crime and ATM fraud is a risk. Only use ATMs inside bank premises during business hours.

If you're a victim of an ATM [scam](/before-you-go/safety/scams "Scams that affect travellers"), report it to the local police.

#### Local travel

#### Border areas

Do not travel to the Belarus-Ukraine border due to military conflict. Do not travel to areas near borders with Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland due to restrictions on movement and the volatile security environment. Armed violence is possible at any time. More information on crossing borders can be found on the [State Border Committee website (in Russian)](https://gpk.gov.by/).

Always carry your passport, original visa, and migration card with you. Local authorities won't accept copies.

Some border areas in Belarus have limited entry border zones. You need a [special permit](https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-zone-borderline/rules-for-staying-in-border-line-for-foreign-citizens/) issued in advance by the State Border Committee to enter.

Limited entry zones are generally sign-posted and restricted by road barriers and border guard posts.

Don't enter limited entry zones without a valid permit.

#### Driving permit

You'll need an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Belarus.

You must get your IDP before you leave Australia.

#### Road travel

Due to ice and snow, some roads outside large cities may be impassable in winter.

Drivers must have either:

* an original ownership certificate for their vehicle
* a rental contract or
* a power of attorney from the owner of the vehicle

If you drive a foreign vehicle in Belarus, you must pay a fee to use toll roads. You can be fined if you don't. Check payment, toll roads and maps on [BelToll](http://beltoll.by/index.php/en).

You must also have a 'green card' (proof of vehicle insurance) valid for Belarus. If not, you must buy compulsory car insurance at the border.

#### Air travel

Flights in and out of Belarus are extremely limited. Several countries (including all EU member states, the UK and Ukraine) have banned the overflight of their airspace by Belarusian airlines. Travel to and from Belarus is only possible through an indirect air route via a country that hasn't imposed a ban.

DFAT doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. If you're flying domestically or internationally, research your aviation provider.

Check [Belarus' air safety profile](http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=EW) with the Aviation Safety Network.
