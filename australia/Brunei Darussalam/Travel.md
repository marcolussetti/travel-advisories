#### Visas and border measures

> Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering.

#### Visas

You need a visa to travel to Brunei. Visas and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the nearest Brunei High Commission or Brunei Ministry of Foreign Affairs for details about visas, currency, customs, and quarantine rules.

Immigration regulations are strictly enforced and overstaying can attract harsh punishments, including imprisonment and caning.

Check the entry stamp in your passport to confirm how long you can stay.

Monitor your immigration status and visa expiry date.

#### Border measures

You must have the following before boarding your flight:

* a valid air ticket
* a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders).
* a completed [E-Arrival Card](https://www.imm.gov.bn/)
* a completed [Health Declaration Form](https://www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel#/home) (BruHealth Portal)
* a medical insurance policy with a minimum coverage of BND10,000 (if travelling for tourism purposes and staying longer than two weeks).

You're required to complete an [E-Arrival Card online](https://www.imm.gov.bn/) before arriving in and departing Brunei. This includes air, land and sea routes. Transit passengers who do not pass through Brunei's immigration control posts will not be required to complete an E-Arrival Card. Refer to Brunei's [Immigration and National Registration System Portal](https://www.imm.gov.bn/) for more information.

Due to the global increase in Mpox cases, it's mandatory for all individuals arriving in Brunei by air, land, or sea to complete a [Health Declaration Form](https://www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel.#/home) through the "BruHealth" mobile application or [Brunei's Ministry of Health Website](https://www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel.) within 3 days before arrival.

You’re required to hold medical insurance throughout the duration of your visa, with tourists needing a minimum coverage of BND10,000 and Work Pass holders and long-term business or professional visits require a minimum coverage of BND100,000. 

Proof of your medical insurance will need to be shown at Brunei’s immigration control posts when entering. Failure to provide proof of medical insurance will limit your visa to a validity of two weeks. Exemptions are given to those transiting Brunei for up to 72 hours and holding an onward ticket. Insurance can be purchased from local insurers or international companies offering worldwide coverage that includes Brunei.

#### Other formalities

If you wish to cross Brunei's land or sea borders, you must apply online through the [Exit and Entry System (EES)](https://login.bdnsw.gov.bn/ees/user/login). There is a service fee of $BND 3.00.

#### Passport

#### Validity

Some countries won’t let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you’re just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. Travellers can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport’s expiry date before you travel. If you’re not sure it’ll be valid for long enough, consider getting [a new passport](/consular-services/passport-services "Passport services").

Check that your passport has at least 6 blank pages back-to-back, as recommended by Brunei authorities.

#### Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

* In Australia, contact [the Australian Passport Information Service](https://www.passports.gov.au/contact-us).
* If you’re overseas, contact the nearest [Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/Pages/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas.aspx).

#### Passport with 'X' gender identifier

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest [embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination](https://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Public/MissionsInAustralia) before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers.

#### Money

The local currency is the Brunei Dollar ($BND). You can also use Singapore dollars ($SGD). They have the same value as the BND.

You can use credit cards in some places.

Australian dollars can be changed at banks, hotels and authorised exchange bureaus.

#### Driving permit

To drive in Brunei for up to 1 year, you need both:

* an Australian driver's licence (a digital driver's license may not be accepted)
* a valid international driving permit (IDP)

Driving without an IDP could void your travel and vehicle insurance.

You should get a local driver’s licence if you need to drive for longer than 1 year.

#### Road travel

Driving can be dangerous. It's common for drivers to:

* drive through red lights
* exceed the speed limit
* not use seatbelts
* drive without a licence or insurance

If you plan to drive:

* check that your insurance policy covers driving
* get to know the local traffic laws and practices
* drive legally
* avoid 'road rage'
* don't react to other drivers

If you're involved in a road accident as a driver, don't leave the scene or move your vehicle until the police have arrived.

There are limits on the sale of diesel and petrol for vehicles not registered in Brunei.
