## Overview

### Safety

* Serious crime is rare in Brunei. Petty crime such as theft and burglary does occur. Keep your valuables secure. Lock your accommodation, even when you're inside.
* Heavy rain, thunderstorms, and lightning strikes are common throughout the year. Incidents of objects and people being struck by lightning have occurred.
* Weather conditions can change quickly and leave you stranded or injured, especially at sea or in a remote area. If you're sailing, hiking, or in a remote area, be prepared and take all the necessary precautions that qualified personnel and local authorities recommend.
* Crocodiles are common in Brunei, and crocodile attacks have occurred along the rivers. Use caution when around water sources and follow the advice of local authorities.
* Stray dogs are common. Don't approach or touch dogs and be mindful of dogs when walking or exercising. Although there have been no official rabies cases in Brunei recently, cases have been reported recently in Malaysia close to the border with Brunei. See a doctor immediately if an animal scratches or bites you.
* Terrorism is a worldwide threat. Be alert to possible threats, especially in public places.

### Local laws

* Brunei is a Muslim country and has strict religious laws. These include laws around fasting during Ramadan, preaching without government permission, and Muslim religious observance. Know and follow these laws.
* Brunei's Sharia (Syariah) Penal Code took full effect in April 2019. It applies to everyone, including foreigners and non-Muslims. Some crimes, including blasphemy, sodomy and adultery, attract the death penalty under sharia law. Understand the law before you travel.
* Brunei's common law also contains offences that are not crimes in Australia, including crimes such as conducting sexual relations outside of marriage and engaging in intimate public displays of affection, including kissing.
* Selling alcohol and consuming alcohol in public is against the law. Smoking is illegal in most public places. It's also illegal to import alcohol and tobacco products above legal limits. If you import alcohol, keep the paperwork to prove it's legal. Check with the [Brunei Customs and Excise Department](http://www.bdnsw.gov.bn/Pages/RoyalCustomsExciseDepartment.aspx) before bringing alcohol or tobacco into Brunei.
* Don't use or carry illegal drugs. Some drug offences have mandatory death penalty sentences. Other penalties include long prison sentences or physical punishment.
* You may be required to wear a mask when entering a hospital or medical clinic or attending an event where the organiser has directed participants to wear masks.
