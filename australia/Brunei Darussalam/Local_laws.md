# Local laws

#### Dual citizenship

Brunei doesn't recognise [dual nationality](/node/65).

Australians entering with a Bruneian passport will be treated as Bruneian by local authorities.

Enter on an Australian passport to ensure access to Australian consular services.

#### Local customs

Dress and behaviour standards are conservative. Take care not to offend.

If in doubt, seek local advice.

Be cautious when making comments about local issues, particularly those relating to the royal family. You could cause offence or even attract legal consequences.

Businesses, including shops and restaurants, close between 12pm to 2pm every Friday for prayers.

Government offices and local schools do not operate on Friday, they open on Saturday instead.

#### Ramadan
