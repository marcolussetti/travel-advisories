# Safety

#### Crime

Serious crime is rare.

Travellers are occasionally the victims of petty crime, such as theft, burglary, and vehicle break-ins.

To protect yourself from crime:

* leave valuables in a secure location
* watch your personal belongings
* always lock doors and windows at your accommodation

#### Cyber security

You may be at risk of cyber-based threats during overseas travel to any country. Digital identity theft is a growing concern. Your devices and personal data can be compromised, especially if you're connecting to Wi-Fi, using or connecting to shared or public computers, or to Bluetooth.

Social media can also be risky in destinations where there are social or political tensions or laws that may seem unreasonable by Australian standards. Travellers have been arrested for things they have said on social media. Don't comment on local or political events on your social media.

#### Demonstrations and protests

Civil unrest is rare.

Public protests and events that draw large groups of people can turn violent.

* avoid protests and demonstrations
* follow the advice of local authorities

#### Climate and natural disasters

Brunei experiences heavy rain, thunderstorms, and lightning strikes throughout the year. Incidents of objects and people being struck by lightning have occurred.

The wet seasons are September to January and May to July. Flooding and mudslides are common during these times.

[Severe weather](/while-youre-away/crisis-or-emergency/severe-weather-incident "There's a severe weather incident") can affect essential services, such as power.

If a [natural disaster](/before-you-go/safety/natural-disasters "Staying safe when there's a natural disaster") occurs:

* secure your passport in a safe, waterproof location
* monitor local media and other sources such as the [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://gdacs.org/)
* follow the advice of local authorities
* keep in contact with friends and family

#### Wildlife and outdoor activities

#### Wildlife

Brunei is home to saltwater crocodiles. They live along the Brunei River and beaches. People fishing on the riverbank have been attacked and killed by crocodiles.

There are venomous snakes in Brunei. Keep your distance if you encounter a snake outdoors. If a snake is found indoors or in a confined space, call Fire and Rescue Services on 995, who also capture and remove crocodiles.

Stray dogs are common. Don't approach or touch dogs. Be mindful of dogs when walking or exercising.  
  
Although there have been no official rabies cases in Brunei recently, cases have been reported recently in Malaysia close to the border with Brunei. Rabies is fatal if you don't get vaccinated or don't get medical treatment quickly. See a doctor immediately if a dog, monkey or other animal scratches or bites you.

#### Outdoors Activities

Trekking in the jungle and parks can range from beginner-level to more advanced options. Trekkers have been known to go missing. Inform family and friends before your trek and take a phone and sufficient supplies.

Avoid swimming in rivers, wear a life vest when on boats and adhere to local advice when near a water source, as crocodiles in Brunei have been known to attack people.

Local beach rescue services may not be of the same standard as in Australia.
