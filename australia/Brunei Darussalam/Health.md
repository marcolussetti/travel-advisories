#### Travel insurance

Get comprehensive [travel insurance](/before-you-go/the-basics/travel-insurance "Travel insurance") before you leave.

Your policy needs to cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation. The Australian Government won’t pay for these costs.

If you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. This applies to everyone, no matter how healthy and fit you are.

If you're not insured, you may have to pay many thousands of dollars up-front for medical care.

You no longer require COVID-19 insurance to enter Brunei, but travel insurance that covers COVID-19 is strongly encouraged.

Confirm:

* what activities and care your policy covers
* that your insurance covers you for the whole time you’ll be away

#### Physical and mental health

Consider your physical and mental health before you travel, especially if you have an existing medical condition.

See your doctor or travel clinic to:

* have a basic health check-up
* ask if your travel plans may affect your health
* plan any vaccinations you need

Do this at least 8 weeks before you leave.

If you have immediate concerns for your welfare, or the welfare of another Australian, call the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 or contact your [nearest Australian Embassy, High Commission or Consulate](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/our-locations/missions/our-embassies-and-consulates-overseas) to discuss counselling hotlines and services available in your location.

#### Medications

Not all medication available over the counter or by prescription in Australia is available in other countries. Some may even be considered illegal or a controlled substance, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in Brunei. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating:

* what the medication is
* the required dosage
* that it's for personal use

#### Health risks

#### Insect-borne diseases

Insect-borne diseases occur, including:

* [dengue](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue)
* [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis)

To protect yourself from disease:

* make sure your accommodation is insect-proof

* wear long, loose, light-coloured clothing

We recommend you get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis if you travel to rural areas. Seek medical advice if you have a fever, muscle pain, rash or severe headache.

#### HIV/AIDS

[HIV/AIDS](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids) is a risk in Brunei.

Take precautions if you engage in activities that expose you to the risk of infection.

#### Other health risks

Waterborne, foodborne and other infectious diseases are common, including:

* [hepatitis](https://www.who.int/hepatitis/en/)

#### Red algae

Red algae sometimes reaches dangerous levels in coastal waters. Local authorities may issue red tide warnings about:

* swimming in certain areas
* eating certain types of seafood

Local authorities print warnings about red algae in local newspapers, including in English-language publications.

If there's a red tide alert, follow local warnings. This algal bloom can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Avoid shellfish and seafood because they may be affected.

#### Medical care

Medical facilities in Brunei's public hospitals are of reasonable quality.

Private hospital facilities are of a high standard.

If you become seriously ill or injured, you may need to be moved to Australia or Singapore. Medical evacuation can be very expensive.
