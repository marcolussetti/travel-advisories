* You must have a visa to participate in athletic or study programs.
* U.S. students and athletes have been denied entry and held at Spanish airports because they didn't have the right visa.
* If your coach or program says you don't need a visa to study or play sports in Spain, confirm it with the nearest Spanish consulate before you travel.

**U.S. citizen minors living in Spain**

* Parents and guardians should prepare a notarized, written permission. It should allow their minor children to travel to or from Spain alone or with someone else.
* All Spanish minors, including dual U.S. citizens, must have this parental permission to travel without a parent or guardian.
* Spanish authorities have sometimes blocked U.S. citizen minors from leaving the country when traveling without a parent or guardian.

**HIV/AIDS restrictions:**

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Spain.
