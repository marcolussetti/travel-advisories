# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens traveling to Spain are not subject to any COVID-19 entry restrictions.

Spain is a party to the [Schengen Agreement](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html). This means that U.S. citizens may enter Spain for up to 90 days for tourism or business without a visa. Your passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay. You must have sufficient funds and a return airline ticket. Visit the [Embassy of Spain](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/washington/en/Paginas/index.aspx) website for the most current visa information.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit, transit and/or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay.** If you plan on transiting a Schengen country, review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/)

**Students and athletes:**Students, prospective students, and athletes should visit the [Embassy of Spain](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/washington/en/Paginas/index.aspx) website for additional information on entry requirements. You should not travel to Spain as a student or for an athletic/study program without the appropriate Spanish visa. U.S. citizen students and athletes have been denied entry and held in immigration detention at Spanish airports awaiting return flights to the United States because they lacked the appropriate visa. If your coach or sponsoring program says that you do not require a visa to study, play for a sports team, or participate in a sports training program in Spain, you should confirm this information with the nearest Spanish consulate in the United States before you travel.

**U.S. citizen minors living in Spain:** Spanish law mandates that all Spanish minors traveling internationally without their parents or legal guardians must have written notarized permission from a parent or guardian. The law also applies to foreign, minor residents if their country of nationality also requires parental permission. While U.S. law does not require minors traveling without a parent/guardian to have the parents’/guardians’ written permission, Spanish authorities and airlines have occasionally misinterpreted the law and stopped U.S. citizens minors from departing the country. Therefore, parents/legal guardians should consider preparing a notarized, written permission for their U.S. citizen minor children to travel abroad unaccompanied or with a third party.

**HIV/AIDS restrictions:**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Spain.
