[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal penalties**U.S. citizens must follow local laws. If you break laws, even by mistake, you could be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You may be prosecuted in the U.S. for crimes committed abroad regardless of the local law.

* Learn more about examples of [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and information provided by the U.S. Department of Justice.
* If you are starting a business or a profession that requires additional permits or licensing, seek information from the competent local authorities beforehand.
* Possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in Spain can lead to severe penalties, including long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Most cities in Spain ban drinking alcohol in the street, except at registered cafes and bars. You could be arrested or fined for breaking the law.
* Local police, sometimes dressed in plain clothes, can ask you to show ID. They can also detain you for further questioning.
* Carry a photocopy of your passport with you as proof of your identity. If you are stopped by someone who claims to be a plainclothes police officer, ask to see their law enforcement ID.

**Arrest notification**  
If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy Madrid or U.S. Consulate General Barcelona immediately.

**Counterfeit and pirated goods**Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries.

* They may be illegal according to local laws.
* Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.
* You may be subject to fines or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.
