**Emergency numbers**For emergency services **dial 112**.  You may ask for an English-speaking attendant.

**Prescription medications**Good medical care is available in Spain. However, the rules for medications are different from those in the United States:

* Do not ship medication from the United States to Spain. Spanish rules do not permit the international shipment of medications.
* Spanish customs will reject and return any medication sent from the United States. This could cause a long delay in receiving your medications.
* The U.S. Embassy cannot help you get back medications taken by Spanish customs.
* Medications requiring prescriptions in the United States also require a local doctor’s prescription in Spain.
* Some medicines prescribed in the United States do not have a local equivalent.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Spanish embassy](https://es.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) to ensure the medication is legal in Spain

Review the [European Agency for Medication](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/birth-abroad.html) list prior to travel.

* Medical care is not free in Spain. If you require medical attention, you will incur expenses, even if you are treated in a public healthcare facility.
* Lack of payment may bar future travel to Spain.
* Most care providers abroad only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides [coverage abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on [types of insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) available.
