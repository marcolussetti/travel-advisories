Good medical care is available in Spain. However, regulations regarding medications vary from those in the United States. Spanish regulations do not permit the international shipment of medication**. Do not ship medication from the United States to Spain**. Spanish customs authorities will reject and return to the shipper medication mailed from the United States. This may cause a significant delay in receiving your medications. The U.S. Embassy cannot help you retrieve medications stopped by Spanish customs.

Medications requiring prescriptions in the United States also require a local doctor’s prescription in Spain. In some instances, a medicine prescribed in the United States will not have a local equivalent. It is important that travelers research this on the[European Agency for Medication](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en) website prior to travel.

For emergency services in Spain, dial 112. You may ask for an English-speaking attendant.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical care is not free in Spain. If you require medical attention, you will incur expenses, even if you are treated in a public healthcare facility. Lack of payment may bar future travel to Spain.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [embassy](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/washington/en/Paginas/index.aspx) to ensure the medication is legal in Spain.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance or funds before admitting a patient.  Medical staff may speak little or no English. Patients may be asked to bear costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Patients have to pay their medical treatment in public hospitals.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-for-work-other-reasons/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.

**Pharmaceuticals:**U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**If you are considering traveling to Spain to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

Surrogacy is illegal in Spain and subject to complex local regulation.
