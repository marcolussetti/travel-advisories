**Terrorism**[Terrorists](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) and their supporters may target U.S. citizens abroad with knives, firearms, and vehicles.

Terrorists may target crowds at:

* Large public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Popular hotels, clubs, and restaurants
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation (subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights)

Spanish authorities have taken strong measures to prevent terrorist attacks, including arresting suspects linked to plots. However, credible sources report terrorist groups continue to plan attacks in Europe, including in Spain.

**Crime**Pickpocketing and other types of theft are very common in Spain. Criminals often use distractions to steal from victims. Car break-ins are also frequent in Spain.

Street crimes against U.S. citizens usually occur in:

* Tourist spots
* Airports
* Train stations
* Urban and beach destinations

Violent crimes, including robberies, have been reported. Some victims have needed medical treatment.

**Follow these tips to stay safe:**

* Use common sense. Stay alert to your surroundings.
* Take the same personal security measures you would take at a large city or tourist destination.
* Always keep track of your passport, including on flights and other transportation.
* There have been reports of passports being stolen on planes to and from Spain, changing gates, collecting luggage at baggage claim, or while waiting for a taxi.
* Do not let your guard down when you pass through security at any airport. This is particularly true at the Barcelona International Airport.
* Keep track of all personal belongings when picking up rental cars or while waiting for taxis.
* Never leave bags unattended. Keep valuables like passports, cash, and phones in a safe spot, not in outer pockets or on tables or floors.
* Don't leave bags on chairs, counters, or on top of our suitcase or travel bag. Do not leave bags out of your control in places like hotel lobbies, train stations, car rental places, airports, or restaurants.
* Avoid carrying your passport unless needed for travel, especially in tourist areas. Instead, carry a copy or photo of your passport's bio page.
* Consider leaving your passport in a secure place, like a hotel safe. You will need your passport to check in to any hotel in Spain, and you may need it for trains.

**Sexual assault**The U.S. Mission in Spain has received many reports of sexual assaults of U.S. citizens. Victims include younger travelers, students, and exchange teachers.

* Many U.S. victims of sexual assault in Spain say they feel judged and re-victimized during the long and difficult criminal justice process.
* While not required, many U.S. victims of sexual assault in Spain find it helpful to hire a local lawyer or use the Office of Victim's Assistance for support during the legal process. Information about this service is given at the police station when the report is filed.
* There have been many reports of sexual assaults by Manuel Blanco Vela, a tour operator in Seville, Spain, against U.S. student victims. Research tour companies online to make informed decisions.
