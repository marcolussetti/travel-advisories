For emergency services or roadside assistance **dial 112**

**Road conditions and safety**Road conditions in Spain can differ significantly from those in the United States.

* Drivers and pedestrians should be extra careful in Madrid and Barcelona. Traffic is faster than in the U.S. and can be confusing due to different signs, traffic lights, and driving habits.
* Motorbikes sometimes weave through lanes.
* You must follow the traffic light at your stop line, as each side of the intersection has its own light.
* Be extra cautious when driving at night in cities. Some drivers or pedestrians may be under the influence.
* In rural areas, night driving can be risky due to farm animals and poorly marked roads.
* Rural traffic is heavier in July, August, and around Christmas and Easter.

**Traffic laws**You must obtain an International Driving Permit prior to your arrival if you plan to drive in Spain. The permits are only valid for 1 year.

* You must have an International Driving Permit to rent a car. If the police catch you without one, they might impound your rental car, and you will have to pay a fine on the spot.
* It is illegal to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving.  You could face a €300 fine and risk losing your license.
* All drivers and passengers must buckle up, including in taxis and the backseat.
* Wear a reflective vest if you stop on the roadside. Place a reflective triangle warning sign.
* Liability insurance is required to drive any car or motorcycle.
* If stopped by local authorities, you may be fined on the spot. You will get a receipt for payment.

**Public transportation**Public transportation in large Spanish cities is generally excellent.

* **Cabs:** Only use clearly identified cabs. Make sure that taxi drivers always switch the meter “on.” This does not apply to fixed-fare trips to and from the Madrid airport. Ask for a receipt. Official taxis from Madrid airport to the city center cost a flat €33. Taxis from Barcelona airport to the cruise terminal cost a [flat fee](https://usdos-my.sharepoint.com/personal/centolasm_state_gov/Documents/Infotaxi).
* **Private transportation:** Companies such as Uber or Cabify are often used in Madrid and Barcelona. However, check private transportation websites for operating status before arrival.
* **Rail:** Service is comfortable and reliable but varies in quality and speed.
* **Intercity buses:** Usually comfortable and inexpensive.

**Aviation safety oversight**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Spain’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
