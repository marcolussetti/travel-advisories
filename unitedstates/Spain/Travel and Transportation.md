# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Road conditions in Spain can differ significantly from those in the United States. Drivers and pedestrians should exercise increased caution as traffic in Madrid and Barcelona is often faster-paced than in the United States and can be unnerving because of unfamiliar signs and traffic lights and different driving habits, including motorbikes weaving between traffic lanes.

Obey the traffic light located at your stop line, as there are separate traffic lights for each side of the intersection. Be alert when driving at night in urban areas; you may encounter drivers or pedestrians under the influence of alcohol.

Night driving in isolated rural areas can be dangerous because of farm animals and poorly marked roads.

Rural traffic is generally heavier in July and August as well as during the Christmas and Easter seasons.

Emergency services, including roadside assistance, are plentiful, competent, and can be easily accessed by dialing 112 from any phone.

**Traffic Laws:** You must obtain an International Driving Permit prior to your arrival if you plan to drive in Spain. The permits are only valid for one year.

It is illegal to rent a vehicle if you don’t have an International Driving Permit. Your rental car may be impounded, and you will be required to pay a fine if stopped by the police.

It is against the law to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving. There is a €300 fine for violating this regulation, and you may also lose your license.

All drivers and passengers are required to buckle up (even in taxis and in the backseat) and wear a reflective vest if they need to stop on the roadside. A reflective triangle warning sign is also mandatory if you stop on the roadside.

You must have liability insurance to operate any car or motorcycle.

If you are stopped by the Spanish National Police or the Guardia Civil, they may levy fines on the spot and issue a receipt for payment. This ensures that foreigners pay their fines while still in Spain.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in large Spanish cities is generally excellent.

Only use clearly identified cabs, ensure that taxi drivers always switch on the meter (except for fixed-fare trips originating to and from the Madrid airport), and ask for a receipt.

Private transportation companies (such as Uberor Cabify) are often used in Madrid and Barcelona but check private transportation websites for operating status before arrival.

Official taxis to and from the Madrid airport to the city center charge a €30 flat rate.  Official taxis to and from the Barcelona airport to the cruise ship terminal charge a €39 flat rate.

Rail service is comfortable and reliable but varies in quality and speed. Intercity buses are usually comfortable and inexpensive.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Spain’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Spain’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Spain should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup). Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Spain.html#ExternalPopup).
