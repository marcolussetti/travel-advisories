# Safety and Security

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists

Since September 2014, the Houthis, who control Sana’a and other areas of northern Yemen, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual Yemeni-U.S. citizenship. Reports say that U.S. citizens are targeted just because they are U.S. citizens. It does not matter how long they have been in Yemen or if they have connections with rebel groups, local businesses, or humanitarian organizations.

During their detention, which can last for years, U.S. citizens are not allowed to contact their families. They also cannot receive visits from U.S. consular personnel or international humanitarian organizations. The U.S. government has very limited ability to help U.S. citizens in detention. There has been no U.S. diplomatic presence in Yemen since the Houthis took over Sana’a.

In addition to the risk of detention by rebel groups, U.S. citizens in Yemen face other dangers. These include ongoing conflict, terrorist activity, and kidnappings for ransom. Violence, armed conflict, and artillery shelling continue in many areas of the country. Yemen remains very unstable and dangerous.

Ships in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden should be on high alert. Tensions in the region increase the risk of damage to ships from missiles, projectiles, or waterborne explosive devices. Piracy is also a threat in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean. There have been many pirate attacks in waters near Yemen in recent years. The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) warns that regional tensions have increased the risk of maritime attacks by extremists in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Bab al-Mandeb.

MARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 011-973-1785-3879. All suspicious activities and events are also to be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802, 202-267-2675, or TDD 202-267-4477. For further information, see the Department of State’s [International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html) and the [United States Maritime Administration (MARAD)](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) advisory on vessels transiting high risk waters.

Landmines and unexploded ordnance also pose a risk. This is of particular concern in the six southern provinces and in the northern highlands.

**Please note that the local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Yemen is 199, but operators do not speak English.**

**Crime**: Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on assistance from local authorities.  Foreigners are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas.

**Scams**: Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Yemen.  Review the [Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime**: The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  Report crimes to the local police at 199.  As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, you should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country for services.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

**Domestic Violence**:  The law in Yemen protects against domestic violence under general prohibitions of violence, but authorities do not enforce this provision effectively. The law criminalizes rape, but not spousal rape. Authorities may prosecute rape survivors on charges of fornication if the perpetrator is not charged with rape. According to law, without the perpetrator’s confession, the rape survivor must provide four male witnesses to the crime.

The law allows leniency for persons found guilty of committing an “honor” killing or violently assaulting or killing a woman for perceived “immodest” or “defiant” behavior. The law does not address other types of gender-based abuse, such as forced isolation, imprisonment, and early or forced marriage.

See Section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for additional information.

As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country. The U.S. government is extremely limited in the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.

**Tourism**:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in Yemen on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
