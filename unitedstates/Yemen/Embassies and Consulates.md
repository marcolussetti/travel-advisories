# Embassies and Consulates

[#### Embassies and Consulates](javascript:void(0); "Embassies and Consulates")

The [U.S. Embassy in Sana’a](https://ye.usembassy.gov/) suspended operations on February 11, 2015, and therefore cannot provide consular services in Yemen.  The U.S. government has extremely limited capabilities to assist U.S. citizens in Yemen.

The U.S. Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens avoid travel to Yemen due to the very high risk of kidnapping and detention.  U.S. citizens in Yemen are strongly recommended to depart the country.  U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty – including lengthy delays – when attempting to depart Yemen. More information can be found in our [Yemen Travel Advisory.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html)

Please direct inquiries regarding U.S. citizens in Yemen to [YemenEmergencyUSC@state.gov](mailto:YemenEmergencyUSC@state.gov). Callers in the U.S. and Canada may dial the toll-free number 1-888-407-4747. Callers outside the United States and Canada may dial 1-202-501-4444.
