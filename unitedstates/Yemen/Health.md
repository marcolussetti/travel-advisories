**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Yemen Ministry of Health](https://moh.gov.ye/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Yemen.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
