# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**:  Road conditions in Yemen differ significantly from those in the United States. Travel by road in Yemen is risky and often includes lengthy delays at checkpoints when traveling between cities. See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information. Visit the website of [Yemen's national tourism office](http://www.yementourism.com/).

**Traffic Laws**: Traffic laws in Yemen are rarely enforced.  Drivers frequently ignore  traffic laws, particularly late at night. Yemeni law mandates right-hand driving, but some drivers occasionally use the left side of the road. Speed limits are generally not enforced, but speed detectors are present in some areas. Additionally, bribery is not uncommon among local officials.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Yemen, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Yemen’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel**: The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise increased caution.

Mariners planning travel to Yemen should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
