*Reissued after periodic review with minor edits related to terrorism and security****.***

Do not travel to Yemen due to **terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict,**and**landmines**.

**Country Summary:** The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Yemen. U.S. citizens should not travel to Yemen for any reason.

The Department of State has designated Ansarallah (commonly referred to as the Houthis) as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. Other terrorist groups, like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, also plan and carry out attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets, as well as government buildings and facilities. There is also a risk of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminals, and other groups or individuals. Foreign workers and employees may be targeted.

A civil war continues in Yemen. Even though violence has decreased since a truce in April 2022, instability and fighting are still common, especially along the front lines in central Yemen. Travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreigners are frequently targets of kidnapping and carjacking, especially outside of urban areas.

Military conflict has destroyed basic infrastructure like housing, medical facilities, schools, and utilities. This makes it hard to get electricity, clean water, and medical care. Humanitarian groups face obstacles in delivering food, medicine, and water. Landmines are found throughout Yemen.

Violent and organized crime is common in Yemen. Local law enforcement may not be able or willing to respond to serious crimes.

Health services in Yemen are poor. There is a re-emergence of diseases like cholera, polio, and measles, which are spreading, especially in Houthi-controlled areas. Medicine and medical supplies are hard to find. Adequate medical treatment is often not available.

U.S. citizens, especially dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens, are at high risk of kidnapping and detention in Yemen. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, may be kidnapped for forced marriage. These often involve family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana’a, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual citizenship. U.S. citizens, have faced difficulty and delays when trying to leave Yemen.

Some companies outside Yemen have misrepresented the safety of the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist trips with unofficial and invalid "visas." These companies put tourists in danger and legal jeopardy. Only the Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Socotra. Do not travel to Socotra or any part of Yemen.

Limited commercial flights are available from Aden and Sana’a to other airports in the region. Check with airlines and travel companies for the latest flight information.

Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Maritime Administration’s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI)](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal).

The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen’s ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise caution.
