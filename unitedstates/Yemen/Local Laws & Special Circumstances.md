# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

In Yemen, the law may be applied inconsistently, and foreign travelers may be taken in for questioning if they do not have their passport with them. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can land the driver immediately in jail. The criminal penalties in Yemen may be very different from what U.S. citizens are accustomed to in the United States.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  The U.S. Department of State has designated the U.S. Embassies in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Djibouti, and Cairo, Egypt, to handle American Citizens Services cases emanating out of Yemen. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in one of these locations immediately.  See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances**: Photographing military installations, including airports, equipment, or troops is forbidden.  Such photography has led to the arrest of U.S. citizens.  Military sites are not always obvious.  If in doubt, ask specific permission from Yemeni authorities.

U.S. citizens who travel to Yemen are subject to the jurisdiction of Yemeni courts, as well as to the country's laws, customs, and regulations. This holds true for all legal matters, including child custody and travel restrictions.

The U.S. Department of State cannot intervene in custody matters, and parents must work through the local courts.  Women in custody disputes in Yemen will not enjoy the same rights that they do in the United States, as Yemeni law often does not work in favor of the mother.  U.S. custody orders might not be enforced in Yemen.

U.S. citizen girls and women who travel to Yemen are at risk of being forced into marriage and may be vulnerable to other forms of gender-based restrictions and violence, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.  U.S. citizen women who are married to Yemeni or Yemeni-American men should be aware that their children may not be able to depart if the children are brought to Yemen.  In many instances, women must obtain permission from their husbands to obtain an exit visa.  They also may not be able to take their children out of Yemen without the permission of the father, regardless of who has legal custody.  U.S. divorce decrees may not be recognized in Yemen, especially if the marriage took place in Yemen.  In some cases, U.S. citizen women who have married in Yemen and divorced in the United States have been prevented from departing Yemen by their ex-husbands.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: The law prohibits denunciation of Islam, conversion from Islam to another religion, and proselytizing directed at Muslims.  Religious minorities face persecution, including detention, as a result of their religious beliefs, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.

**LGB Travelers**: Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Yemen as is gender expression that does not conform with a person’s assigned sex at birth.  Penalties include fines, jail time, or death.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and Section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Yemen prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public may not be as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

See our [Travelers with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

**Students**:  See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers**: See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

Women face deeply entrenched discrimination. Women cannot marry without the permission of their male guardians; do not have equal rights in inheritance, divorce, or child custody; and have little legal protection. They experience discrimination in employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses, education, and housing.  A male relative’s consent is often required before a woman can be admitted to a hospital.

Women traveling in areas under Houthi control may be required to be escorted by a male guardian who is a relative.

See Section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) and the Special Circumstances section above for more information.
