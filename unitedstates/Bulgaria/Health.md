**For emergency services in Bulgaria, dial 112.**

Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

* Adequate health facilities are available at some hospitals in major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Not every hospital/clinic in equipped for pediatric care. If you need emergency services for an infant/child, please call ahead to ensure those services are available.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills**.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Credit card payment is not always available. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Bulgaria’s Customs Agency](https://customs.bg/wps/portal/agency-en/home) to ensure the medication is legal in Bulgaria.

**Vaccinations**:  Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Bulgaria.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health Facilities:** The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://bg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/)in Bulgaria.  **We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.**

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Bulgaria.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Bulgaria.
* Although Bulgaria has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Bulgaria, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for use in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
