# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

A valid U.S. passport is required for U.S. citizens. Your U.S. passport must be valid for at least three (3) months from the expected date of **departure** from Bulgaria. U.S. citizens traveling on regular tourist passports cannot stay more than a total of 90 days in Bulgaria within a 6 month-period without a Bulgarian visa. This law is strictly enforced. **Travelers who depart the country after a 90 day stay will not be able to re-enter Bulgaria without a visa before the six-month period expires.**

**U.S. official, service, and diplomatic passport holders must obtain a Bulgarian visa prior to arrival.** If you are traveling on a U.S. official, service, or diplomatic passport, you will not be allowed to enter Bulgaria without a visa. Please plan ahead and apply for your visa early.

* Visit the [Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mfa.bg/en/services-travel/consular-services/travel-bulgaria/visa-bulgaria) or [Bulgarian Embassy website](http://www.bulgaria-embassy.org/en/homepage/)for the most current visa information.
* While in Bulgaria, always carry your U.S. passport or a Bulgarian residence permit, known in Bulgaria as lichna karta. U.S. passport cards are recognized as proof of citizenship and identity but are not sufficient for international air travel to and from Bulgaria.

**Visitors are required to maintain medical insurance for the duration of stay in Bulgaria. You may be required to present proof of medical insurance at the port of entry.**
