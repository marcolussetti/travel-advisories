# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit, and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Bulgaria are severe; convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail.
* Bulgarian law enforcement authorities may take you in for questioning if you take pictures of certain government buildings, embassies, or military facilities.

**Special Circumstances:** Bulgaria is still largely a cash economy, especially outside of major cities.

* You may exchange money at local banks or exchange bureaus. Be wary of people on streets offering to exchange money, they are usually con artists who intend to swindle unsuspecting travelers.
* Damaged or worn U.S. dollar bank notes are often rejected at banks or exchange bureaus.
* Most shops, hotels, and restaurants do not accept traveler's checks. Credit cards may not be accepted outside the major cities. Local banks such as Unicredit, Bulbank, Bulgarian Postbank, and United Bulgarian Bank (UBB) can cash travelers’ checks.

Corruption remains an important concern of the Bulgarian government. You may refer complaints of public corruption by e-mail to the Ministry of Justice at [anticorruption@justice.government.bg](mailto:anticorruption@justice.government.bg) or by phone to +359 2 987 0697. All grievances must be submitted in the Bulgarian language.

If you plan to import an automobile to Bulgaria, be aware that customs duties on personal vehicles can be high. All documents must be originals or certified copies and contain an apostille.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Bulgaria.

However, LGB individuals face cultural stigma and widespread discrimination. LGB individuals engaging in public displays of affection may attract unwelcome attention or harassment.

According to LGB organizations, courts rejected the right of same-sex partners for protection against domestic violence because the law treats “spousal” only as applying to married persons who cannot legally be the same sex. The Commission for Protection against Discrimination reported receiving very few cases regarding sexual orientation.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section six of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**Bulgarian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, and access to health care, but societal discrimination persists. Bulgarian law requires improved access to buildings for persons with disabilities and new public projects take this requirement into account, but authorities rarely enforce this law in older buildings. Commuting in Bulgaria is very difficult for disabled individuals. Buses, trams, and trolleys generally lack accommodation for disabled travelers. The Sofia metro is the most accessible system for disabled individuals, but its transportation network is limited to Sofia. Disabled travelers should consider traveling with a friend or family member who can assist them in navigating the transportation systems in Bulgaria.
