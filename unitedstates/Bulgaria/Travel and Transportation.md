# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** The Bulgarian road system is largely underdeveloped.

* Roads are in poor repair and full of potholes.
* Rockslides and landslides are common on mountainous roads.
* Livestock and animal-drawn carts are common on roads, especially during agricultural seasons.
* In winter, roads are icy and potholes proliferate.
* Some roads lack pavement markings and lights.
* Motorists often drive with dim or missing headlights

**Traffic Laws:**Driving in Bulgaria is dangerous. Aggressive driving habits, lack of safe infrastructure, and a mixture of late model and old model cars on the country’s highways contribute to a high fatality rate in road accidents.

* **A U.S. state driver’s license is only valid in Bulgaria when used in conjunction with an International Driving Permit.** Such permits must be obtained in the United States prior to travel. Following recent enhanced police enforcement, most rental car companies now require international driving permits to rent cars to U.S. state driver’s license-holders.
* **Avoid confrontations with aggressive drivers.**Drivers are known to speed, swerve into oncoming traffic or go the wrong way on divided highways.
* Traffic lights late at night blink yellow in all directions, leaving the right-of-way unclear and contributing to frequent accidents.
* Heavy truck traffic creates numerous hazards along the two-lane routes from the Greek border at Kulata going to Sofia, and from the Turkish border at Kapitan Andreevo to Plovdiv. **Expect long delays at border crossings.**
* If pulled over by a police officer, **be aware that under Bulgarian law the police officer may not collect fines on the spot** but may confiscate your driver’s license depending on the offense.
* Right turns on red lights are not permitted.
* **Keep your headlights on at all times** no matter the time of day or weather.
* At unregulated crossings, the driver on the right has the legal right-of-way, but this rule is frequently ignored.
* The **use of seat belts is mandatory** in Bulgaria for all passengers.
* Drivers may be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood level as low as 0.05 percent. The penalties for drivers involved in an accident resulting in injury or death range from a US $25 fine to life imprisonment.
* Check out Bulgaria’s Ministry of Interior’s [road rules guide](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bulgaria.html#ExternalPopup "Road Rules Guide").

**Public Transportation:** Sofia’s metro system and the extensive bus network are reliable modes of transportation. Taxi cabs are plentiful but are known to overcharge passengers. Do insist on use of the meter when using a taxi or use a mobile application based taxi service.
