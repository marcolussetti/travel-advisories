# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The U.S. Department of State has assessed Sofia as being a LOW-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests.

**Crime:** U.S. government personnel are not prohibited from traveling to any specific areas of Bulgaria due to crime. Most criminal acts in Bulgaria take place in Sofia. Other districts with a slightly lower level of crime than Sofia are Varna, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Stara Zagora. The lowest crime levels are in the districts of Smolyan, Kardzhali, Vidin, Silistra, and Razgrad. Most of Bulgaria experienced a decrease in crime in 2021 compared to 2020.

ATM skimming, credit card fraud, and traffic incidents remain the most common threats to U.S. citizens in Bulgaria. Majority of incidents involving U.S. citizens are monetary in nature, though incidents of racism, ethnic slurs, and harassment of African Americans and religious minorities have occurred. Report crimes to the police by dialing**112.**

* **Pick pocketing and purse snatching**are frequent occurrences, especially in crowded markets, on shopping streets, near airport ATMs and aboard the busy tram and bus lines. Con artists often operate on public transportation and in bus and train stations.
* **Use caution at ATMs**. Be wary of people who approach you at an ATM and offer assistance. Do not give your PIN to anyone under any circumstances.
* Police stations should provide translators for anyone who needs to report a crime but will often require the victim to return at a later time or bring his/her own translator.
* **Use taxis with meters** and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield. **Taxi drivers are known to overcharge unwary travelers** particularly at Sofia Airport, the Central Train Station, and at Black Sea resort areas. The airport has a clearly marked exit within the arrival terminal that leads travelers to metered taxis at a fair rate and a booth to assist with obtaining taxi services. Inquire about the fare before entering a taxi and always account for all luggage, packages, and hand-carried items before paying and releasing a taxi. Popular mobile application based taxi services like Uber or Lyft do not operate in Bulgaria, but there are local taxi services that use similar mobile applications such as Yellow Taxi and Taxime.
* **Automobile theft** and break-ins are common in residential areas and in parks. Four-wheel-drive vehicles and late-model European sedans are the most popular targets.
* **Burglary**is a common crime. If you plan to reside in Bulgaria on a long-term basis, take measures to protect your home and consider installing window grilles, steel doors with well-functioning locks, and an alarm system.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. They mainly occur in downtown Sofia in the areas surrounding and between Parliament and the Presidency.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; even those intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Exercise caution if unexpectedly found in the vicinity of large gatherings or demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* In an emergency, U.S. citizens should call the police (#112), seek a safe location, and wait for assistance.
* Messages regarding demonstrations are posted on the [Embassy's website](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbg.usembassy.gov%2F&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7Ce920dbe2a09f4f4f783608db879ee9ab%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638252888810755097%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=AH1fwkszyN%2FInOvA7%2FqbT9mS5cHRXEXIfmByHx8%2ByXk%3D&reserved=0 "https://bg.usembassy.gov/").
