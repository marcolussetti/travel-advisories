# Health

[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Only basic medical care is available, and only on the main islands of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).

Health care facilities in the FSM consist of state-run hospitals on each of the four major islands, one private hospital in Pohnpei, and a few scattered clinics. There is a lack of medical infrastructure for treating trauma cases, especially those involving extreme sports. Medical evacuation assistance is available only by air. Due to the remoteness of the islands, assistance can take days to arrive and is expensive. There are no daily commercial flights on Chuuk, Yap, or Kosrae. Because flights often sell out, finding last-minute seats can be difficult.

For emergency services in the FSM, dial 911.

Ambulance services are not widely available.Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

* In Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap, and Kosrae States, you can reach ambulance services by calling the State hospitals.
* Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, nor are they staffed with trained paramedics. Emergency responders often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/environmental-hazards-risks/safety-and-security-overseas) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Medication**

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. The government does not provide a list of medications that cannot be brought into the FSM, but travelers bringing medication should have a doctor’s note prescribing the medication

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-vaccines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
