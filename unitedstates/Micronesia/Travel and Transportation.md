**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Driving in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is hazardous because of poor road conditions, few streetlights, no traffic signals, and pedestrians and animals walking in the road.
* Road conditions can worsen after heavy rains.
* Roads outside of towns are unpaved.
* Traffic accidents often result in fatalities or serious injuries.
* Drivers mostly have no training in safety or driving skills.
* Exercise increased caution while driving at night because other drivers may be under the influence of alcohol or sakau (a traditional kava drink).

**Traffic Laws:**

* Motorcyclists are required by law to wear helmets.
* Traffic moves on the right side of the road, but many people drive used cars from Japan with right hand side steering, making it hard for drivers to see around corners.
* It is common for vehicles to stop suddenly, and vehicles may not pull off the road.
* The general speed limit is 25 mph (40 km/hour) and lower in school zones.
* **Driving while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.** Driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotic, or other drug, to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine of not more than $500, or both such fine and imprisonment.
* **Causing death or bodily injury while driving under the influence.** Any person operating or driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor who causes the death of or bodily injury to any person, shall be punished by imprisonment for less than three years, or a fine of less than $3,000, or both such fine and imprisonment

**Public Transportation:** There is no public transportation. Taxis are available in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), but you should always be careful, because many taxi drivers are reckless, do not have government issued drivers licenses, and are known to take advantage of single women. Taxis are often shared; very few taxi drivers accept single fares.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of the FSM’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.faa.gov%2Fabout%2Finitiatives%2Fiasa&data=05%7C02%7CBullivantVL%40state.gov%7C2d9d506a1f164c443b4108dd54e0f51e%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638760047356682692%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=LY0JyEVMorK9jFxdlVV3Zi6cwqqsYK1UJPbwEMAGpEk%3D&reserved=0) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maritime.dot.gov%2Fmsci-advisories&data=05%7C02%7CKramerLM%40state.gov%7C85739bcf877140e1c26308dd6af6a570%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638784329743831836%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hXPZxDQITtfWb7%2B8Q5iIA0fqejoKXwYab5ASyie6bKc%3D&reserved=0).  The [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsi.nga.mil%2FNavWarnings&data=05%7C02%7CKramerLM%40state.gov%7C85739bcf877140e1c26308dd6af6a570%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638784329743871349%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GjN8TWA%2FquFD6AQ2g15ydwTRmalU%2F7jx%2BVJpY6Y0s%2Bs%3D&reserved=0) website may also provide relevant information. The FSM requires all foreign pleasure vessels to check in with immigration and customs upon mooring in the FSM.

The U.S. Coast Guard has found FSM ports do not have effective anti-terrorism measures. Vessels that arrive in U.S. ports from the FSM must meet additional U.S. Coast Guard conditions of entry as described in the current Port Security Advisory, [International Port Security Program - Port Security Advisory](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Prevention-Policy-CG-5P/Inspections-Compliance-CG-5PC-/International-Domestic-Port-Assessment/International-Port-Security-Program-Port-Security-Advisory/). Mariners and passengers traveling through FSM ports should exercise caution and implement enhanced security measures.
