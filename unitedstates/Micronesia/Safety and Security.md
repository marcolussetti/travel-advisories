# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**

* Petty theft, physical and sexual assaults, and other violent crimes occur in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Outside of city limits, local residents may wield guns as a form of intimidation.
* Crime rates are significantly higher in Chuuk, and incidents in Chuuk have included assaults on U.S. citizens.
* Crime increases at night, and alcohol usually plays a role, especially in assaults.
* Sexual assaults do occur in the FSM. You may report any sexual assault to the local police and the U.S. Embassy.
* Do not attempt to intervene in disputes between local citizens.
* Compared to norms in the United States, local police are less responsive to victim concerns, particularly in cases involving burglary. Local police do not possess the resources to fully investigate crimes.
* To remain safe:
  + Exercise normal precautions at all times.
* Unexploded ordnance from World War II remains, including in sunken vessels and aircraft,  especially in Chuuk, Yap, and surrounding channels. Report any threats against your safety or suspicious unearthed items to the local police and the U.S. Embassy.
* Be alert to any unusual activity around your home or business.
* Stay indoors after dark and avoid walking on the streets because there are few streetlights.

**Victims of Crime:**

* Report crimes to the local police by dialing 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 320-2187.
* Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.
* See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.

* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. Divers should check on hyperbaric chamber functionality with a reputable international dive organization before diving in the FSM. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.
