**Crime:**

* Petty theft, physical and sexual assaults, and other violent crimes occur in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Outside of city limits, local residents may wield various weapons as a form of intimidation.
* Crime rates are significantly higher in Chuuk, and incidents in Chuuk have included assaults on U.S. citizens. Visitors to Chuuk should stay on public roads and in public venues and consider limiting travel at night.
* Crime increases at night, and alcohol usually plays a role, especially in assaults.
* Sexual assaults do occur in the FSM. You may report any sexual assault to the local police and the U.S. Embassy.
* Do not attempt to intervene in disputes between local citizens.
* Local police do not possess the resources to fully investigate crimes, particularly in cases involving burglary.
* To remain safe:
  + Exercise normal precautions at all times.
  + Be extra vigilant in Chuuk

* Unexploded ordnance from World War II remains, including in sunken vessels and aircraft, especially in Chuuk, Yap, and surrounding channels. Report any suspicious unearthed items to the local police and the U.S. Embassy.
* Be alert to any unusual activity around your home or business.
* Stay indoors after dark and avoid walking on the streets because there are few streetlights.

**Scams:** Review the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)' s Protecting Yourself from Scams and the [FBI pages](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) for information.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. Divers should check on hyperbaric chamber functionality with a reputable international dive organization before diving in the FSM. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html). Review our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.
