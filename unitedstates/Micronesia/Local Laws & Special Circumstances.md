# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Public drunkenness is a felony in Yap.
* Kosrae has strict codes of conduct on Sundays. Checking with a local contact before engaging in any activity is encouraged.  Selling and drinking alcohol on Sunday is forbidden by local law, and swimming, diving, fishing, and working are all strongly discouraged.
* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs, including marijuana, in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)  are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. The FSM may detain or charge U.S. citizens arriving with products with cannabidiol (CBD).
* Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.
* It is dangerous and illegal to remove World War II “souvenirs” from sunken vessels and aircraft.  Some jurisdictions also have laws against removing shells and other items from the ocean.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Natural Disasters:** The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is subject to typhoons, flooding, drought, and mudslides. The Pacific typhoon season extends from July through December. For information about crisis preparedness, see our webpage on [Crisis and Disaster Abroad: Be Ready](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html), the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/natural-disasters), and the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/natural-disasters/) pages.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). However, Micronesian society is conservative, and the LGB community remains very discreet in general. In April 2023, a Filipino resident of Kosrae with LGB ties was found dead in his home. Two Kosraeans were subsequently charged with murder, manslaughter, and aggravated assault. See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Accessibility and accommodation, if available, are vastly different from what you find in the United States. Neither laws nor regulations mandate accessibility to public facilities, services, or accommodations for persons with mobility issues. There are few sidewalks and streetlights in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). There is no public transportation. Taxis are run by independent operators who make no provision for people with mobility issues. The national Department of Health and Social Affairs is responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. However, they rarely take action to enforce these measures.
