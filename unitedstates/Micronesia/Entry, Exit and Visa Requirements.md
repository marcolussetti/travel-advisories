# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the Embassy of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) [website](https://fsmembassy.fm/) for the most current information.

You will need a U.S. passport valid for at least 180 days from the time of entry, a completed FSM Immigration Arrival and Departure Record, and a completed FSM Customs Form in order to enter the FSM. Your air carrier will distribute the FSM Immigration Arrival and Departure Record and Customs Form before you arrive in the FSM. U.S. citizens may enter the FSM to live, work, or study indefinitely without visas or non-citizen registration requirements per the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the FSM. There is no limit to the length of time U.S. citizens can remain in the FSM.

The FSM imposes departure taxes, which you must pay when you leave each island. For current departure fees visit [Micronesiaâ€™s Customs Regulations](https://visit-micronesia.fm/regulations/) webpage. Please make sure you have cash available, as credit cards are not accepted, and ATM machines are not available at any of the airports. There is no departure fee for U.S. officials traveling on official or diplomatic passports.

Travel on commercial aircraft between states of the FSM is considered to be international travel, and persons who are not citizens of the FSM are required to comply with passport requirements upon arrival in any state of the FSM from a commercial aircraft **regardless of the point of boarding.**

**Travel Letters:** U.S. citizens in the United States (including Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) with family ties to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) are able to enter the FSM with only a U.S. birth certificate and travel letter from the FSM Embassy in Washington, DC, or Consulates in Honolulu, Guam, or Portland. However, they are not allowed to enter the United States without a U.S. passport. Transiting Guam or Honolulu on the way to non-U.S. destinations is also not allowed without a passport. **Thus, U.S. citizens should make sure to have their U.S. passport when traveling to the FSM, especially outside of Pohnpei. Travelers, including small children, have been stranded in Chuuk, Yap, or Kosrae for days and weeks waiting to receive their passport, because the only U.S. Consulate is on Pohnpei.**

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).
