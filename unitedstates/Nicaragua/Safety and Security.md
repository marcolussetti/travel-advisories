# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Government of Nicaragua is authoritarian. It limits freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. It represses internal dissent, and it monitors and responds to perceived threats to its authority. Nicaragua’s Sovereign Security Law and its Terrorism and Money Laundering Law allow for discretionary interpretation of often vaguely defined unlawful activities. For example, threatening the peace and economic stability of Nicaragua. Convictions under these laws have often been arbitrary. They result in long prison sentences and loss of assets (money and property). They also result in deportations with bans on returning to Nicaragua.

Nicaraguan authorities and armed civilians in plain clothes known as “para police” may monitor, detain, deny entry to, expel, or question U.S. citizens concerning their activities. This includes U.S. citizen contact with Nicaraguan citizens. Visitors should avoid any commentary on Nicaraguan politics or governance.

The Nicaraguan government may detain or expel individuals for activities that would not be considered criminal or offensive in the United States. Nicaraguan authorities have subjected U.S. citizens, including dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens, to prolonged detentions. The detentions are often politically motivated or arbitrary. Especially in politically motivated arrests, the judicial process has regularly been criticized as neither fair nor transparent.

Demonstrations or strikes may occur throughout the country; in the past, the Nicaraguan government has violently suppressed them. Avoid demonstrations, and exercise extreme caution around large gatherings.

Roads may be closed, and public transportation may be disrupted due to large crowds celebrating the following holidays:

* Semana Santa (the week before Easter);
* Repliegue Historico a Masaya (early July);
* The week of July 19th celebrations of the Sandinista Revolution;
* Celebration in Managua of Santo Domingo, the Patron Saint of the city (August 1st and August 10th);
* Day of the Nicaraguan Army (September 2);
* Nicaraguan Independence Day (September 14 and 15); and
* Immaculate Conception (December 8).

**Crime:** Vehicle burglaries, pick-pocketing, and occasional armed robberies occur in store parking lots, on public transportation, and in open-air markets like the Oriental and Huembes Markets in Managua. Petty street crime is common. Police presence is limited outside of major urban areas. The Caribbean coast’s geographical isolation further limits the U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens living in or visiting the area.

* Uniformed police and para-police commit violence and intimidate civilians throughout the country for political reasons.
* **U.S. citizens have reported extortion for bribes.** These occurred at immigration and police checkpoints.
* **U.S. citizens have been sexually assaulted** in beach resort areas.
* There are **no forensic doctors on the Corn Islands**, so victims of violent crimes, including sexual assault, must travel to Bluefields at their own expense for medical examinations and collection of evidence. In several recent cases, **police were reluctant to produce police reports or pursue charges**. Please report such incidents to the Embassy.
* Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime.
* **Exercise extreme caution when renting or driving vehicles.** In one common scam, “Good Samaritans” pull over to help change a flat tire. While the driver is distracted, an accomplice steals the driver’s possessions.
* Due to crime and other illicit activity, **U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are prohibited from entering** Managua’s Oriental Market (*Mercado Oriental*). They are also prohibited from entering gentlemen’s clubs throughout the country.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.state.gov.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Ftravel%2Fen%2Finternational-travel%2Femergencies%2Finternational-financial-scams.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety) page for information.

**Victims of Crime:**  Report crimes, including sexual assault, to the local police at 118 (Nicaraguan equivalent of “911,” in Spanish). Report serious crimes to the U.S. Embassy at 2252-7100 immediately and minor crimes during business hours.

* Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

* See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.state.gov.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Ftravel%2Fen%2Finternational-travel%2Femergencies%2Fcrime.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600).

The U.S. Embassy can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Share information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States](https://nacvcb.org/).
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited financial support in cases of destitution.
* Help you find accommodation and flights home.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Coastal Disputes:** Be aware of the following border disputes:

* Nicaragua and Colombia have an ongoing dispute over waters surrounding the San Andres Islands.
* The Nicaraguan Navy has challenged vessels passing through its exclusive economic zone.
* Nicaragua and Costa Rica have stationed security forces at Harbor Head (also called Isla Calero) at the eastern end of the San Juan River.
* Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador have maritime and land disputes over islands and access to fishing rights in the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific Coast.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in major cities. In the event of a diving injury, the only hyperbaric chamber is in Puerto Cabezas, over 100 miles from Corn Island where most tourists dive. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.state.gov.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Ftravel%2Fen%2Finternational-travel%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fyour-health-abroad%2FInsurance_Coverage_Overseas.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600).

**Beach Safety:** Exercise extreme caution at the beach. Strong undertows and currents make swimming in Nicaragua’s Pacific Coast extremely dangerous. This is true, even for experienced swimmers. U.S. citizens have drowned at Nicaraguan beaches, and in lagoons and lakes. Warning signs are not always posted. Lifeguards and rescue equipment are not normally available, and Nicaragua’s search and rescue capabilities are limited. Surfers and swimmers have been struck by boats at Nicaraguan beaches. This has resulted in serious injury and death. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities. Consider your physical capabilities and skills before swimming. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.

Hiking in volcanic or remote areas is dangerous. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. Carry sufficient food, water, and communication equipment. If you travel to remote areas, hire a reputable local guide. Nicaraguan law requires tourists to hire a local guide for most volcanic hikes. This includes the two volcanoes on Ometepe Island (Maderas and Concepcion).

**Disaster Preparedness:** Nicaragua is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. Plan for seeking emergency care, shelter, or evacuation routes. Many remote locations in the country lack good cell phone coverage.

* If traveling during the rainy season (May – November), inclement weather can develop suddenly and last for days, creating flooding and landslides.
* If you are at a coastal area when an earthquake occurs, move swiftly to higher ground (when safe to do so) to avoid possible tsunamis.
* In the event of an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or other natural disaster, U.S. citizens should pay close attention to local media reports.Follow the guidance of local authorities. Monitor the websites of the Nicaraguan Institute for Territorial Studies ([INETER](https://www.ineter.gob.ni/)) and the Nicaraguan Emergency Alert System ([SINAPRED](http://www.sinapred.gob.ni/)) websites.
