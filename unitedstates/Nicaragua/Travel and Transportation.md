# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Main roads between major cities are generally paved and in good condition. Other roads may have potholes, lack shoulders, be poorly lit and narrow. Speed bumps are often poorly marked. During the rainy season, roads may become flooded or have additional damage. Horse carts, livestock, and pedestrians crossing roads in front of oncoming traffic are common. This happens even on major roads in the main cities. Most roads on the Caribbean coast are unpaved. Road signs throughout the country are limited or non-existent. Road travel after dark is hazardous in all areas. Carry a cellphone in case of emergency. However, understand cell reception may be spotty in many areas of the country. Do not drive outside urban areas after dark.

**Traffic Laws:**  **If you are involved in a traffic accident, you must wait for the police and insurance company representatives to arrive before you move your vehicle.** However, especially during overnight hours, police and insurance companies may not respond. Do not move your vehicle until a police officer tells you to do so. Otherwise, you may be legally liable for the accident. If you receive a traffic violation, police may take your driver’s license until you pay the fine. Depending on your length of stay, you may not recover your license in a timely manner.

Nicaraguan law requires that police take a driver into custody for:

* Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol (the legal limit in Nicaragua is 0.05% blood alcohol content); or
* For being involved in an accident that causes serious injury or death. In fatal accidents, drivers are held until they reach a legal settlement with the victim’s family. The minimum detention period for fatal accidents is 48 hours.

To avoid liability, consider hiring a professional driver through a reputable hotel.

All drivers must carry:

* Driver’s license;
* Proof of insurance;
* Vehicle registration;
* Emergency triangle;
* Fire extinguisher; and
* Inspection and registration stickers.

These regulations also apply to drivers in rental vehicles. Penalties for not having any of the above include fines and towing. For more information, check with the [Nicaraguan National Police](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.policia.gob.ni.mcas.ms%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) or the Embassy of Nicaragua.

**Traffic Stops:** Transit police often stop vehicles with either local or foreign license plates.

If transit police demand a bribe instead lieu of a fine, request a receipt and the officer’s name and badge number.

To report mistreatment by police, email a complaint to [Nicaragua’s National Police](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.policia.gob.ni.mcas.ms%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) and forward a copy to the [U.S. Consular Section in Managua](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.migob.gob.ni.mcas.ms%2Fmigracion%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600).

If you receive a traffic violation, police may confiscate your driver’s license until you pay the fine. Depending on your length of stay, you may not recover your license in a timely manner.

**Public Transportation:**Buses, moto-taxis, and ferries often lack proper safety equipment.

* U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use public buses and most taxis (including moto-taxis) due to safety and crime concerns.
* Use only licensed taxis recommended by airport authorities, major hotels, restaurants, or other trusted sources.
* Exercise caution in the face of possibly overloaded or unsafe ferries and boats. Check with local naval or police authorities about the safety of being on the water in local weather conditions. Most vessels provide insufficient numbers of life vests and other safety equipment.

Airports in remote places often have short airstrips, minimal safety equipment, and little boarding security.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) assessed the government of Nicaragua’s Civil Aviation Authority as compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Nicaragua’s air carrier operations in 2015.
