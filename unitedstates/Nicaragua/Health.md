Public and private hospitals in Nicaragua do not meet U.S. standards. Many hospitals are understaffed. Some hospitals may not be able to assist in emergencies. Only basic, limited emergency medical services are available outside Managua. Physicians and hospital personnel frequently do not speak English.

Managua has a sole private hospital that is JCAHO  ([Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations)](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jointcommission.org.mcas.ms%2Fwhat-we-offer%2Faccreditation%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) certified, with labs and radiology services available, though it has a very limited number of specialists for acute emergencies. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Government hospitals are understaffed and some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Private hospitals and physicians expect up-front payment. This can be done with cash or credit card.

Ambulance services are not widely available. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. They provide transportation and basic first aid only.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills nor medical evacuation (air ambulance) costs. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.**

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Even with health insurance, most care providers overseas require cash payments prior to providing service. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.state.gov.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Ftravel%2Fen%2Finternational-travel%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fyour-health-abroad%2FInsurance_Coverage_Overseas.html%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600). We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation costs to the United States from Nicaragua can be expensive. It starts at $15,000 and goes up to $100,000 or more. The cost depends on the destination and level of care required.

If traveling with prescription medication, review the [Nicaraguan Ministry of Health's Pharmacy Department](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minsa.gob.ni.mcas.ms%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2022-10%2FACUERDO%2520MINISTERIAL%2520288-2013%2520ENVIOS%2520PERSONALES.pdf%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) web guidance page on entering with pharmaceuticals products.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
