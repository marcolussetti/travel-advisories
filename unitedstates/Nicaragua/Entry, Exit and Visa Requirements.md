# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The Government of Nicaragua has denied entry to and expelled U.S. citizens. This includes dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens and individuals that previously traveled to/from Nicaragua without incident. The government targets real or perceived opponents to the Government of Nicaragua. Those targeted include:

* NGO workers;
* Academics and students;
* Business representatives;
* Civil society leaders;
* Religious and charity workers (including foreign missionaries);
* Journalists;
* And many others.

The Nicaraguan government has revoked foreigners’ residency status. It has revoked status for actions or expressions it perceives as political. The government has arrested, denied permission to travel, and prevented individuals from leaving the country for political reasons. Immigration authorities regularly review social media for evidence of political expression or activity and warn against such activities.

**Requirements for Entry:**To enter Nicaragua, you need a U.S. passport that is valid for your length of stay. All visitors must pay **$10 USD** in cash for a tourist entry stamp upon arrival (exact change is recommended.). The stamp is valid for up to 90 days.

* **For visitors other than tourists**, the Government of Nicaragua recommends that you pre-register your trip. You can do so by following the instructions available on the [Nicaraguan immigration website](https://www.mint.gob.ni/migracion/) (in Spanish only). See [our website](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fni.usembassy.gov.mcas.ms%2Fimmigration-laws%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567&McasTsid=15600) for additional information.
* Individuals traveling from countries at risk of yellow fever transmission must show **proof of yellow fever vaccination**. The vaccine must be administered at least 10 days before travel to be permitted entry to Nicaragua.
* All travelers should have an **onward or return ticket**. They also need **evidence of funds** to support themselves while in Nicaragua.
* If you use a passport of a different nationality than you used on prior trips to Nicaragua, Nicaraguan authorities may deny you entry. If you have multiple nationalities, you should carry a valid passport for all of them. If you have Nicaraguan nationality, you should have both your U.S. and Nicaraguan passports with you.
* Nicaragua is part of the “Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement” with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Under that agreement, U.S. citizens who legally enter any of those four countries may travel freely among the other three countries for up to 90 days.

**Requirements for Exit:**

* If you stayed in Nicaragua beyond the date noted on your entry stamp, you must obtain an extension from Nicaraguan immigration. You must also pay any required fines.
* You must exit Nicaragua with the same passport used for entry. If your U.S. passport is lost or stolen while in Nicaragua, you will need to get a new entry stamp from Nicaraguan Immigration before you can depart by following the instructions available on the [Nicaraguan immigration website](https://www.mint.gob.ni/migracion/) (in Spanish only).
* All residents of Nicaragua must pay $10 USD (cash only) for an exit stamp from Nicaraguan Immigration, prior to departure. This fee can be paid at the airport, land borders, or at any Nicaraguan Immigration office.
* There is a $42 USD tax that must be paid upon exiting. (This tax is normally included in the price of the plane ticket for air travelers.)

**Prohibited Items:** Drones and similar devices are prohibited. They will be seized by customs authorities upon arrival. Customs may also seize photography equipment, videography equipment, and binoculars. There is no mechanism to retrieve these items later. Nicaraguan government authorities may also search personal phones, computers, electronics, and documents for anti-government content. They also sometimes seize such private property. For more information, see “Customs Regulations” below. Additionally, the transportation of arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment is strictly prohibited without written approval from the Nicaraguan government. Do not transport any arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment. Such items include, but are not limited to:

* Weapons;

* Functional, inert, or decorative ammunition, even one bullet;
* Empty or spent shell casings;
* Body armor;
* Handcuffs;
* Any other military or police equipment.

All U.S. citizens, including U.S. government, military, and contractor personnel found to be carrying such items, even in the smallest quantities, will be arrested and face strict criminal penalties. Penalties including imprisonment, large monetary fines, forfeiture of the items, and deportation. This is regardless of whether airlines and/or U.S. authorities allowed the items shipment on a U.S.-originating flight.

**Advanced Coordination Required for Volunteer Groups:**Please note that since 2018 the Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 NGOs and charitable organizations, including religious organizations. Groups engaged in these types of activities, including the apolitical provision of basic services, may be denied entry.  You should email both the Nicaraguan Embassy in the United States ([asistente.emb@embanic.org](mailto:asistente.emb@embanic.org)) and the Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign Affairs ([enlace@cancilleria.gob.ni](mailto:enlace@cancilleria.gob.ni)) to inform them of your trip and secure advance permission if you are leading one of the following types of trips, even if your group has worked in Nicaragua previously or has a local office:

* Volunteer mission;
* Charitable or Medical brigades (the latter also needs permission from the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health); or
* Assistance visits organized by NGOs, religious groups, missionaries, charitable groups, schools, or any other group doing this type of work in Nicaragua.

**IMPORTANT:**Even with a visit approval, the Government of Nicaragua may rescind the decision without advance notice.
