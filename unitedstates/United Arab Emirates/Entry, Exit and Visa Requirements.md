# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**COVID-19 Requirements:** There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

U.S. citizens are subject to all UAE immigration laws.

* **Passport Validity:** A passport valid for at least six months beyond the date of entry is required to enter the UAE. The UAE government does not accept 12-page emergency passports for entry to the UAE. The UAE government also does not accept passports with the “X”  marker for travel to, in, or through the UAE. Travelers with these passports will be denied boarding or entry.
* **Personal travel of 30 days or less:** A U.S. citizen with a regular (non-emergency) passport with an M or F marker may obtain a no fee visitor visa upon arrival. The UAE government does not accept passports with the “X” marker for travel to, in, or through the UAE. Travelers with these passports will be denied boarding or entry.
* **Stays longer than 30 days:** Visitors on a 30-day visa may request a visa extension, which is at the discretion of immigration officials. Anyone planning to work or study in the UAE must obtain the appropriate visa.
* **Medical Exam:**A full medical exam is required for work or residence permits. The exam and tests for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis B, tuberculosis, leprosy, and pregnancy must be performed after arrival. U.S. citizens have been detained and deported for testing positive for HIV, active tuberculosis, or hepatitis. Medical exams performed outside of the UAE will not be accepted.
* **Travel on Diplomatic or Official Passports:**U.S. citizens traveling to or through the UAE on diplomatic or official passports are required to obtain a visa before travel (transit passengers only require a visa if exiting the airport). This requirement is strictly enforced by UAE officials and those not meeting the requirement will be denied entry. U.S. military travelers should not assume military ID cards will be accepted, but should consult the Foreign Clearance Guide.

**Land Exit Departure Fee:** All travelers who depart the UAE by land and who are not citizens of a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country must pay a departure fee. The fee is 35 UAE dirhams and is payable only in the local currency.

Please verify this information with the [Embassy of the United Arab Emirates](http://www.uae-embassy.org/) before you travel.

**Exit Controls:** The UAE maintains tight exit controls. All travelers must exit the country with the passport on which they entered. Travelers should visit a UAE immigration office prior to departure to obtain an exit pass if they plan to leave the UAE without the passport on which they entered.

Travelers both departing the UAE and transiting will be barred from exiting the UAE if there are any criminal or civil legal cases against them. Travelers have been arrested at the airport and have had their passports seized due to outstanding financial cases, unsettled legal disputes, and late credit card payments, including for cases that were previously unknown to the traveler. In such cases, some individuals have been arrested and detained for long periods of time. Individuals will be barred from leaving the UAE until legal cases are settled in full. This affects all persons whether they are in the UAE as residents, tourists, or transit passengers with no intention of exiting the airport. UAE residents can verify with UAE authorities whether they have an exit ban due to outstanding cases in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. More information on this process can be found on the [UAE Government Portal](https://www.government.ae/en/information-and-services/passports-and-traveling/preliminary-checks/check-if-you-have-a-travel-ban).

The Government of the UAE requires that all persons residing in the country have a national identification card. U.S. citizens who are working or living in the UAE should visit the [Emirates Identity Authority website](https://government.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/emirates-ihttps:/government.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/emirates-id) for more information on card registration procedures and requirements.

**Cancellation of Visas:** All UAE visas must be formally cancelled through the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) before a new visa can be issued. This includes visas that have already expired or have never been used. Travelers may be denied entry to, or not permitted to depart, the UAE if previous visas have not been properly cancelled. More information on the process is available on the [UAE Government portal](https://government.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visa/cancelling-your-residence-visa).

**Dual Nationality:** The UAE does not recognize dual nationality. The UAE recognizes only the citizenship of the passport on which a person enters the UAE. The embassy may be prohibited from providing certain consular services to those who did not enter the UAE on a U.S. passport.

The UAE has imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on all foreigners seeking residency. Travelers for tourism are not tested or requested to provide information about HIV/AIDS status. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of the UAE](https://www.uae-embassy.org/) before you travel.
