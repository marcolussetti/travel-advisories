Adequate health facilities are available, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. While most common conditions can be appropriately treated in the UAE, complex medical conditions may be better treated in the United States. Providers may recommend a large number of procedures and tests, some of which may be unnecessary.

* Hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient, except in emergencies.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

For emergency services in the UAE, dial **999**.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may be denied care, even in an emergency, if you are unable to provide a cash deposit up-front. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medication:**Many prescription and over-the-counter medications are prohibited in the UAE, and possession of such substances without the appropriate approval is generally treated the same as possession of illegal narcotics. All tourists and residents of the UAE should seek prior approval, via an online form, before carrying certain types of medications, narcotics, or chemical substances to or through the UAE. The service can be accessed directly on the Ministry of Health and Prevention’s [website](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/issue-of-permit-to-import-medicines-for-personal-use). Travelers can also find updated lists of prohibited medications requiring prior approval on the same website.

Travelers with prescription medication must have their prescriptions issued by licensed doctors and authenticated by the appropriate authorities. In order for a U.S. prescription to be fully authenticated, it must be authenticated by the Secretary of State of the U.S. state in which the prescribing doctor is licensed, then by the U.S. Department of State, and finally by the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC. [Additional information on authentication of documents](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/UnitedArabEmirates.html) can be found on the State Department’s website and on the [Embassy and Consulate General website](https://ae.usembassy.gov/). Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
