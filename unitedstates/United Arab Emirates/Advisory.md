Exercise increased caution in the United Arab Emirates due tothe threat of terrorism and missile or drone attacks.

**Country Summary:** Residents and visitors generally find a safe and secure environment in the UAE, but regional tensions have aggravated the risk of attacks on U.S. citizens and interests. Militant groups operating in Yemen have threatened neighboring countries, including the UAE, with missile and drone attacks. Across the region, terrorists may attack with little or no warning and may target tourist locations, transportation hubs, shopping areas, places of worship, and government facilities.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) recommending caution for U.S. air carriers and commercial operators operating in the Middle East, including the UAE. For more information, U.S. citizens who plan to travel to the region should check the [FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).

Residents and visitors should be aware the UAE has strict rules on social behavior, drug possession, traffic violations, and financial crimes. Breaking these rules can lead to arrest and/or an exit ban. U.S. citizens should review the country information page for the UAE to learn about local laws and special circumstances.
