# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

U.S. citizens in the United Arab Emirates should exercise a high level of security awareness. The possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula remains a serious concern. The UAE’s normalization of relations with Israel in September 2020 increased the potential for attacks in the UAE, including by Iran-backed entities. Separately, rebel groups operating in Yemen have stated an intent to attack neighboring countries, including the UAE, using missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones). Yemen-based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks against the UAE on January 17 and 24, 2022, targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure.  The January 17 attack resulted in multiple impact sites in Abu Dhabi and three fatalities. The Houthi rebels have publicly stated their intent to continue such attacks. In the event of a missile and/or drone strike, follow the guidance found [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html).

Both historical and current information suggest that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), al-Qaida, and affiliated organizations continue to plan attacks against Western targets; these attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics, including suicide operations, assassination, kidnapping, hijacking, and bombing.

**Boating:** The UAE and Iran have had a long-standing dispute concerning jurisdiction of Abu Musa, approximately 20 miles from Dubai. Fishing or sailing in these waters may result in seizure of vessels and detention of passengers and crew in Iran. Obtaining consular assistance in Iran for U.S. citizens is difficult and can only be done through the [Swiss Embassy in Tehran](https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/iran/en/home/representations/embassy-of-switzerland-foreign-interests-section.html), which acts as a Protecting Power, providing limited U.S. consular services.

**Crime:** Violent crimes and crimes against property are rare. U.S. citizens should take the same security precautions in the UAE that one would practice in the United States or any large city abroad.

**Harassment and Assault:** U.S. citizens, especially women, should take precautions against the possibility of verbal and physical harassment or sexual assault when walking alone, consuming alcohol, or riding in a taxi cab. Taxi passengers should avoid sitting in the front seat of a taxicab and should be sensitive that "small talk" can be misinterpreted as over-friendliness or even a form of propositioning by some taxi drivers. Taxis driven by women for the exclusive use of female passengers are available in some airports and by dispatch. Female travelers can identify these dedicated vehicles by their pink roofs.

Some victims of sexual assault have been prosecuted for violating laws against sexual relations outside of marriage. The law puts a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sex was not consensual. In cases where the victim has failed to demonstrate so, both parties have been prosecuted, and sometimes sentenced to jail time, followed by deportation.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the UAE. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at **999** and contact the U.S. Embassy at +971 2 414 2200. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
