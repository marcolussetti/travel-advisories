Medical facilities are limited in terms of space and capability. Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medicines including antibiotics but do not carry U.S. brand names or generic over the counter (OTC) medications. Outside of these cities, many medicines are unavailable. You should carry a supply of properly-labeled prescription drugs and other OTC medications adequate to cover your entire stay.

Sanitation levels in hospitals are very low, except for the La Paz Malabo Medical Center, a Western level and acute care hospital which meets many of the medical standards of a modern hospital in a developed country. Doctors and hospitals often require immediate payment for health services in cash only (CFA). Patients are sometimes expected to supply their own bandages, linen, and toiletries.

For emergency services in Equatorial Guinea, dial 113.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [government of Equatorial Guinea](https://www.egembassydc.com/) to ensure the medication is legal in Equatorial Guinea.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
