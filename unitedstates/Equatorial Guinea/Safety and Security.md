# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Though violent crime is rare, instances of violent burglaries/home invasions have occurred. Travelers have encountered anti-foreigner hostility from police and other officials, especially towards those of perceived Western or Chinese descent. Many situations, including petty or street crime and official harassment, have the potential to turn violent.  Security forces may stop people and request money.

There has been a significant increase in attacks against women, including U.S. citizens, by small groups posing as taxi drivers and passengers. Victims typically are held captive for up to an hour, threatened at knifepoint, and robbed. Take taxis only in groups, use taxi drivers personally known to you, or avoid taxis altogether, especially in Bata. Be mindful of how much cash you have in your possession when entering a taxi and try to avoid carrying large sums of cash.

Avoid dark alleys, remote locations, and traveling alone. Carry a copy of your passport and other pertinent documents at all times. Authorities may perceive notarized copies as more official than non-notarized copies.

**Political Violence**: Demonstrations are not allowed, and therefore are rare. If you encounter a large gathering, avoid the area, as it is likely an illegal demonstration; the police will attempt to disperse the crowd, including through the use of force.

**Maritime Security**: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continues to increase. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common occurrences. Incidents may occur close to coastlines or in open seas. More information on current conditions may be found on the [Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page](https://www.oni.navy.mil/News/Shipping-Threat-Reports/).

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police in Malabo at 113 or nationally to the Equatorial Guinean Ministry of National Security at 666-555-532 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+240) 333-095-741 during business hours or (+240) 555-516-008 after hours.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

It is common to be asked to pay between $50 to $100 in order to file a police report or obtain a copy of a police report on file.

**Cell Phones:**Cellular coverage is sporadic, and communication may not be possible outside urban areas.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
