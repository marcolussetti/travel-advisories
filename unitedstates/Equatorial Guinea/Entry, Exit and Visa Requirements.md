# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea](https://www.egembassydc.com/consular-services) website for the most current visa information.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Equatorial Guinea. However, the Government of Equatorial Guinea may require medical documentation including the determination of the HIV status of third country nationals who are renewing or obtaining residency in Equatorial Guinea. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea](https://www.egembassydc.com/) before you travel.

**Vaccinations:** A certification of vaccination for yellow fever and polio are required to enter Equatorial Guinea (EG). The Yellow Fever vaccine should be administered at least 10 days prior to arrival in the country. The EG Ministry of Health requires that all visitors be up to date on the polio vaccine (a booster dose is advised for those who have completed their normal series). It is increasingly common to be asked for proof of vaccination upon entry, and immigration officials may require you to be vaccinated at the airport (potency and sterility of items is always questionable) or bar entry into the country for those who do not comply with the requirements.

U.S. citizens staying longer than 90 days should register with the local police station.

Private ships landing at Equatoguinean ports must get clearance prior to approaching the shore.
