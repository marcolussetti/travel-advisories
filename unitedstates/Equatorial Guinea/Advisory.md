Exercise increased caution in Equatorial Guinea due to **crime** and **health**.

**Country Summary**: Robbery remains a concern throughout Equatorial Guinea. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict movement. Borders may close without notice. Always travel with your passport and valid visa.

**Health**: Medical services in Equatorial Guinea are limited:

* There are no adequate trauma services.
* Ambulance services are not available.
* Even minor health issues may require medical evacuation at the traveler’s expense.
* We strongly recommend medical evacuation insurance for travel to Equatorial Guinea.
* **Travel safety**: Avoid traveling off-road, in isolated areas, or in places with known dangers like mudslides, flooding, or severe weather.
* Because of limited phone coverage, rough terrain, and the risk of vehicle breakdowns, U.S. citizens should travel in a group of at least two vehicles when going to remote areas.
* Read the [Country Information Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/EquatorialGuinea.html) for additional information on travel to Equatorial Guinea.
* **If you decide to travel to Equatorial Guinea:**

* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html#_blank).
* Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.
* Stay alert in tourist spots and when visiting banks or ATMs.
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/equatorial-guinea?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) related to your travel and return to the United States.
* Bring enough over the counter and prescription medicines.
* Malaria, a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, is common throughout Equatorial Guinea. Even short-term travelers are strongly recommended to take malaria prophylactic medication and use topical insect repellants.
* Get comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.
* We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
