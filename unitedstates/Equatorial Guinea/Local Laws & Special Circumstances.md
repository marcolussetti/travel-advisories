# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events. Societal norms do not allow for the public discussion of homosexuality and there have been numerous incidents of harassment and detention of members of the LGB community. No antidiscrimination law exists to protect LGB individuals.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance***.* Accommodation for individuals with disabilities is not mandated by Equatoguinean law, and travelers with disabilities are likely to encounter difficulties accessing transportation and public buildings. Although sidewalks often are available in major cities (especially in Malabo and Bata), road crossings are frequently uneven and curbs are usually in need of repair. Neither Malabo nor Bata has a public transportation system, and few vehicles are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Public buildings, including restaurants, bars, medical facilities, stores, and government offices, are rarely accessible and frequently have steps or partially obstructed entrances*.*

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Rape and domestic violence are illegal in Equatorial Guinea. However, authorities do not enforce the laws effectively.

See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Currency:** Equatorial Guinea is almost exclusively a cash economy. Generally, credit cards and checks are not accepted, with the exception of a few Western hotels that cater to international business travelers and some restaurants and super markets. Credit card cash advances are not available. Most local businesses do not accept travelers' checks, dollars, or euros. However, dollars can be exchanged at local banks for Central African Francs (CFA). Cash in CFA is usually the only form of payment accepted throughout the country.

ATMs are increasingly available in major cities. Although they are generally secure, travelers may find them out of order, so it is best not to rely on ATMs. You should also exercise caution when using a local bank or ATM as individuals may be waiting around to rob individuals with cash. In addition, you should not hail a taxi right outside of a bank or ATM.

**Photography:** In the recent past, a special permit from the Ministry of Information and Tourism was required for virtually all types of photography in Equatorial Guinea. Although the law has changed, police or security officials may still attempt to fine or detain people taking photographs. Federal laws forbid taking photos of the Presidential Palace and its surroundings, military installations, airports, harbors, government buildings, and any other area the government deems as sensitive. Police and security officials have taken photographers into custody for perceived or actual violations of this policy, or to seize the camera (and/or cell phone) of persons photographing in the country. Also, the police may use this as a reason to try to extort money or threaten foreigners with torture or abuse. As these situations have the potential to become hostile, you should exercise prudence and caution while taking photographs.
