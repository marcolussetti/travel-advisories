# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Please visit the [Embassy’s COVID-19 page](https://kh.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/) for more information on entry/exit requirements related to COVID-19 in Cambodia.

You will need a valid passport and a Cambodian visa to enter Cambodia. Tourist and business visas are valid for one month from the date of entry into Cambodia. [Cambodia offers on-line visa processing](https://www.evisa.gov.kh/). You may also apply in person at the Cambodian Embassy located at 4530 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20011, tel. 202-726-7742, fax 202-726-8381.

Tourists, diplomats, and business travelers may also obtain a Cambodian visa at the airports in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and at all major border crossings. Cambodian immigration officials at airports now collect fingerprints upon entry using an inkless, electronic process. You will need a passport valid for a minimum of six months beyond the date of entry into Cambodia.

If you remain in Cambodia beyond the date of your authorized stay, Cambodian immigration officials will likely impose a fine of $10 per day overstayed. In cases of excessive overstays, you may be arrested for violating immigration laws and detained as you undergo official deportation proceedings at your own expense. Deportation from Cambodia may result in your being prohibited from reentering Cambodia in the future. You should contact the nearest Cambodian embassy or consulate, or visit the [Embassy of the Kingdom of Cambodia website](https://www.embassyofcambodiadc.org/) for the most current visa information.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Cambodia
