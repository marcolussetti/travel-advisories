# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cambodia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. If you break local laws in Cambodia, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

The same rights and protections afforded those accused of a crime in the U.S. are not guaranteed in Cambodia, and the judicial process may be influenced by political, personal, and financial connections. In both the criminal and civil judicial systems, resources devoted to the investigation/discovery and trial process fall far below the standard expected in the United States. Cambodia routinely employs pre-trial detention for those charged with criminal offenses, sometimes for long periods of time before a trial is scheduled. Prison conditions in Cambodia are substandard and overcrowded, with little access to health care or basic nutritional requirements.

U.S. citizens in Cambodia should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the Embassy can offer to those with concerns about due process or the fairness of their trial, as the Embassy is unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.

You can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States, and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.

**Arrest Notifications:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://kh.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**LGB Travelers:** While there are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Cambodia, same sex marriage is not permitted. While Cambodians are relatively tolerant toward foreigners, LGB Cambodians routinely face discrimination and harassment, especially outside major urban areas. Public displays of affection are generally frowned upon for couples of any sexual orientation.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** While in Cambodia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what they find in the United States. Currently, except for buildings and hotels that have been built under international standards, most public places and public transportation are not accessible. Persons with disabilities will face difficulties with Cambodia’s sidewalks, rest rooms, road crossings, and tourist areas.

**Women Travelers:** There have been reports of sexual assaults in the vicinity of drinking establishments and possible drugs being used to incapacitate female travelers. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Water Festival:** During this annual festival, which takes place in November, the population in Phnom Penh increases significantly as millions of Cambodians from every town and province flock to the capital for three days. For personal safety and security, you should avoid crowded areas near the riverfront during the Water Festival holiday.

**Customs:**Cambodian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Cambodia of items such as medications, firearms, antiquities, or ivory. It is advisable to contact the [Embassy of Cambodia](https://www.embassyofcambodiadc.org/) in Washington D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Restrictions on Freedom of Expression and Association:** There are freedom of speech restrictions in Cambodia. Anyone who criticizes or insults the King by any means could face between one to five years in prison. This ban includes insults or criticism made online and via social media. The government of Cambodia has used libel and slander laws to restrict public discussion on topics it deems sensitive or against its interests.

**Dual Nationality:**Dual nationality is allowed under Cambodia's 1996 nationality law. However, if you have Cambodian nationality and possess another nationality, you may be viewed as a Cambodian citizen in any court proceedings and face stricter sentences.

**Business Transactions:**Some U.S. citizens have reported threats of personal injury, extortion, detention, or kidnapping related to personal business disputes, in particular those involving real estate. If you are planning to engage in real estate or other significant financial transactions, please proceed with caution and retain the appropriate legal counsel.

**Financial Transaction:**The U.S. dollar is widely used, especially for larger transactions, and most prices are quoted in dollars. Ripped, torn, or stained U.S. bills are not accepted. Authorities encourage greater use of the Cambodian riel, but it is less favored and is mostly given to tourists as change for dollar purchases. The riel is commonly used in smaller towns and rural areas. Credit cards are accepted at some establishments within Cambodia, and a number of banks in Phnom Penh accept credit cards for cash advances. Credit cards are often subject to a service charge. Banks and major hotels accept travelers' checks but usually charge a service fee. Several international banks operate ATM machines that allow travelers to obtain U.S. dollar currency in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and other urban centers. Personal checks are not generally accepted. Several banks serve as Western Union agents, to which funds can be wired, including in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and other provincial cities. Information on Western Union can be found at their [website](https://www.westernunion.com/us/en/home.html).

**Photography:** Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest — including government buildings, military installations, airfields, and bridges — may result in problems with the authorities and confiscation of your camera.
