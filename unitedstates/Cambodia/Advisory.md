Exercise increased caution in Cambodia due to **crime** and **landmines**. Some areas have increased risks. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel to:**

* Areas along Cambodian and Thai border due to **armed conflict.**

**Advisory summary:**

**Phnom Penh**Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. Violent crimes, such as sexual assault and homicide do occur and sometimes are committed against foreigners.

**Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces**Landmines and unexploded ordnance are found in remote areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces.

Do not touch unknown metal objects; instead notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Use a local guide when walking in forested areas or dry rice paddies in these areas.

**Level 4: Do Not Travel  
Cambodia – Thailand Border**

Do not travel to areas within 50km of the Cambodia – Thailand border due to **ongoing fighting** between Cambodian and Thai military forces.

There are reports of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border.  Armed conflict has led to reports of civilian casualties. There is a collateral risk of violence, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all but essential travel to within 50km of these border areas until further notice.  The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces due to the ongoing risk of armed conflict.
