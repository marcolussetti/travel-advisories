**Phnom Penh – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**

Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like jewelry, bags and cell phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against foreigners.

Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night.

**Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**

Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in very remote areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces.

Do not touch unknown metal objects; instead notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Use a local guide when walking in forested areas or dry rice paddies in these areas.
