Medical facilities and services in Cambodia do not meet international standards. Both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap have a limited number of internationally run clinics and hospitals that can provide basic medical care and stabilization. Medical care outside of these two cities is almost non-existent. Local pharmacies provide a limited supply of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Because the quality of locally obtained medications can vary greatly, make sure to bring a supply of your medications adequate for the duration of your stay in Cambodia. You should be wary of purchasing local medication. Counterfeit medication is readily available, often indiscernible from authentic medication, and potentially lethal.

**Be aware that neither U.S. Medicare nor Medicaid apply overseas.**

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

[Supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation is strongly recommended.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of Cambodia  to ensure the medication is legal in Cambodia. Always, carry your prescription medication in the original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Be careful if purchasing off-brand medication from pharmacies in Cambodia. Drugs sold in pharmacies can be fake and possibly dangerous.

Malaria, Dengue and Tuberculosis are serious health concerns in Cambodia. For further information, please consult the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/).

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Cambodia.
