# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Department of State is concerned that individuals and groups may be planning terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and interests, including at sites frequented by Westerners in Southeast Asia. Extremist groups in Southeast Asia have transnational capabilities to carry out attacks against locations where Westerners congregate. Although the extremist threat in Cambodia is considered low and terrorist attacks are not common, U.S. citizens residing in, or traveling to, Cambodia should exercise caution in clubs, discos, bars, restaurants, hotels, places of worship, schools, outdoor recreation venues, tourist areas, beach resorts, and other places frequented by foreigners. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant with regard to their personal security and avoid ongoing police enforcement actions, crowds, and demonstrations. See Department of State’s [Worldwide Caution](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html).

Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in remote rural areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, and Oddar Meancheyprovinces. Travelers in these regions should never walk in forested areas or even in dry rice paddies without a local guide. Areas around small bridges on secondary roads are particularly dangerous. Travelers should not touch anything that resembles a mine or unexploded ordnance; they should notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437.

**Crime:**Cambodia has a critical crime rate, including street crime. Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities’ efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that residences and hotel rooms of U.S. citizens in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep.

The most common type of theft is “snatch and grab” robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc. Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via “tuk-tuk,” as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder that is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. The U.S. Embassy has received reports of violent robberies escalating into fatalities.

Pickpockets, some who are masquerading as beggars, are present in the markets and at the tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket.

To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens not to give their passport as collateral for motorcycle rentals, hotels, etc. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners between $20 and $100 to file a police report.

Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of common scams targeting tourists, often involving card games.[MWP(P1] The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being approached by individuals in public locations, such as popular shopping malls, and being invited to their homes where they end up participating in card games. These are often scams to steal tourists’ money. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you should contact the U.S. Embassy.

Foreigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of crime targeting tourists involving drugged drinks. The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens’ drinks being drugged at bars in order to incapacitate them for theft or sexual assault. Do not accept drinks from strangers and do not leave drinks unattended.

The U.S. Embassy advises citizens to be wary of scams involving individuals claiming they are in Cambodia and need financial assistance from the United States. The Embassy has determined that many of these requests are fraudulent and the individuals making the requests use false identities. In the past year, numerous confirmed media reports of large-scale scam operations have led to a crackdown by Cambodian authorities. These operations have been reported to lure non-Cambodians with false promises of gainful employment. Victims of this false recruitment have then been made to participate in the online/phone-based financial confidence scams.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Cambodia.html#ExternalPopup) pages for information on scams.

There have been numerous reports of visitors receiving fake or novelty $50 and $100 bills from ATM machines and banks across Cambodia. When receiving money from ATMs or bank tellers, you should count and examine the money while still in the presence of the ATM camera or bank teller. The fake money typically has a different feel than real U.S. currency and often has markings on the lower left that indicate it is for novelty purposes. If a suspicious bill is discovered, it should be shown to the ATM camera or teller, and the bank should be notified immediately.

The U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces outside of Phnom Penh to exercise caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle “snatch and grab” thefts of bags and purses.

If you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents.

U.S. citizens are advised not to engage in commercial surrogacyarrangements in Cambodia. In October 2016, the Government of Cambodia issued an official proclamation banning commercial surrogacy in Cambodia. Please keep in mind that U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian laws and procedures.

Although gambling and casinos are legal in Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy strongly encourages all travelers to be cautious in choosing to visit casinos or related gambling centers in Cambodia. The U.S. Embassy is aware of numerous reported incidents at casinos throughout Cambodia. In the past year, these incidents such as fires at casinos resulting in multiple fatalities, violent assaults, murders, and suicides under suspicious circumstances have occurred.

**Victims of Crime:**Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at 023-728-000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**In cases of sexual assault, U.S. citizen victims should contact the U.S. Embassy first** before contacting local police or authorities.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
