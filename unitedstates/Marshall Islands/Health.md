For emergency services in the Marshall Islands dial 625-8666 or 625-2333

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment
* injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance

**The following diseases are prevalent:**

* [Dengue](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/dengue)
* [Hansen’s Disease](https://www.cdc.gov/leprosy/) (Leprosy)
* [Hepatitis A](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/index.htm)
* [Hepatitis B](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm)
* [Tuberculosis](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/default.htm)
* Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.
* There are shortages of medicine and medical supplies throughout the Marshall Islands.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) regarding specific issues in the Marshall Islands.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuations from the Marshall Islands frequently exceed $100,000 and are subject to the availability of properly equipped aircraft.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Ministry of Health & Human Services at secchs.rmi@gmail.com to ensure the medication is legal in the Marshall Islands.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Proof of measles vaccination or signed documentation of contraindication by a doctor is a requirement for entry for travelers over the age six months and born after 1957.

**Health facilities in general**

* Public medical clinics are only available in Majuro and Ebeye but frequently lack basic resources and supplies. There are generally no healthcare facilities in other areas.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in the Marshall Islands.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Water Quality**

* Tap water in the Marshall Islands is not potable and it should not be used even to brush your teeth. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Majuro lagoon has tested positive for E. coli bacteria. Use extra caution to avoid ingesting water when swimming in the lagoon.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Republic of Marshall Islands.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
