# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Unexploded Ordnance:** Unexploded ordnance (UXO) from World War II remains a problem in the Marshall Islands. Underwater UXO may also present a threat. Tourists are advised to heed all warnings on areas that might be affected. Travelers are advised to use extreme caution when hiking or scuba diving.

**Storms and Disaster Preparedness:**The Marshall Islands is in a region prone to storm surges.You should prepare for an emergency before you travel and monitor meteorological websites such as the [Joint Typhoon Warning Center](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html). For general information about storm seasons and disaster preparedness, visit the[State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html), as well as the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/7877) website. Travelers are advised to use these sites for reference.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in the Marshall Islands.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance.**While in RMI, individuals with disabilities might find accessibility and accommodation very different from that in the United States. There are no mandated rules for special support for persons with disabilities. There are few ramps, almost no sidewalks, and few operational elevators in the Marshall Islands. Medical facilities have generally limited and inadequate accessibility.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** The RMI does not practice forced marriage or female genital mutilation. Domestic violence is an endemic problem in the country. Women and girls should avoid riding shared taxis, particularly after dark, and avoid going out alone at night. Women travelers should be aware of local modesty customs and dress conservatively while in public, with special care to cover shoulders and knees.
