# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** The Marshall Islands has a low crime rate.

* The most common crimes are break-ins and thefts from homes, hotel rooms, and vehicles, as well as occasional random acts of vandalism. Keep your hotel room or residence locked at all times.
* The number of violent assaults has increased over the past few years, however, including three homicides.
* Occasionally, fights and assaults occur at nightclubs and bars. If you visit those establishments, especially late in the evening, be extra vigilant to ensure your personal security.
* Use caution when driving or walking on the roads late at night as drunk driving is prevalent and there are no sidewalks and little to no room on the sides of roads for pedestrians to walk. All taxis in Majuro are shared taxis that stop to pick up and drop off passengers frequently.
* There have been reports of taxi drivers and/or passengers sexually harassing women in shared taxis. Women and girls should avoid riding shared taxis, particularly after dark, and avoid walking around alone after dark.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 625 8666 or 625-3233 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (692)-247-4011.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.
