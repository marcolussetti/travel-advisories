# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* There is one paved road on Majuro Island, but there are few traffic signs and no traffic lights.
* While driving, you should be alert for animals roaming the street and children and adults darting into the road without looking for cars, especially after dark.
* Drinking and driving is common, with increased incidences occurring on holidays and weekends.
* Walking beside the street can be dangerous due to poor lighting, the absence of sidewalks, and drivers who may have been drinking.
* Roads experience temporary flooding after heavy rains and during high tides.
* Because there are few streetlights, visibility is poor, and night driving requires special caution.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Vehicle traffic proceeds on the right side.
* The speed limit is 25 mph throughout the island, and there are multiple speed bumps so caution is necessary particularly while driving at night.
* For specific information concerning drivers’ permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, please contact the Embassy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

**Public Transportation:** There is no public transportation system in the Marshall Islands. Shared public taxis are available in Majuro and stop to pick up and drop off passengers frequently. Travel between Majuro and the outer islands is by local air transport that is unreliable or by boat, which can be particularly hazardous from December to April due to strong currents and potential storm surges.
