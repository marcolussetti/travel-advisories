# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs or firearms are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.  
  
Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.  
  
**Firearms:** Do not enter Antigua and Barbuda with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Antigua and Barbuda government. Please contact the [Embassy of Antigua and Barbuda](https://www.antiguabarbudaconsulate.com/overseas-offices) with questions regarding travel with firearms.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual activity between adult men is illegal under indecency statutes and carries a maximum penalty of 15 years. Local law does not extend spousal rights or privileges to LGB individuals married outside of Antigua and Barbuda.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/brazil/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with mobility issues. Sidewalks (if they exist) are very uneven and will only occasionally have ramps or curb cuts at intersections. Pedestrian crossings are also very infrequent and can be poorly marked. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations.
