Medical facilities in Antigua and Barbuda do not meet U.S. standards. There is no hyperbaric chamber, and divers requiring treatment for decompression illness must be evacuated from the island.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas.  
  
**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.  
  
If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Antigua and Barbuda](https://ab.gov.ag/) to ensure the medication is legal in Antigua and Barbuda. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

The following diseases are present:

* Chikungunya
* Dengue
* Zika

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
