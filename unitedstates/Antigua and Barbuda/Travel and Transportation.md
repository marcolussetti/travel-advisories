**Road Conditions and Safety:** Be extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads on foot. Major roads are in average to poor condition, and you may encounter wandering animals and slow moving heavy equipment. Drivers often stop in the middle of the roadway without warning. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and watch for signs of sudden braking. Automobiles may lack working safety and signaling devices.  
  
Please refer to our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/other-legal/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. There is relatively little police enforcement of traffic regulations.  
  
**Public Transportation:**Buses and vans are frequently crowded and may travel at excessive speeds. Make certain that taxi drivers are licensed and are members of the official taxi association. Unlicensed taxi operators have been known to extort money from passengers, despite having agreed to a fare beforehand. This can sometimes amount to double or triple the agreed-upon fare.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/other-legal/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.  
  
**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for regulating aviation safety and security for the government of Antigua and Barbuda, as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Antigua and Barbuda’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
