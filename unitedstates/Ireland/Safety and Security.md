# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime**: Although Ireland has a low rate of violent crime, you should always follow common sense personal security practices and maintain awareness of your surroundings when traveling.

* Rates of theft and petty crime have risen in recent years, and thieves often target tourists. In rare cases, these crimes involve physical assault or violence, more commonly in Dublin city center and in popular tourist areas.
* Rental cars are frequently targeted. They are easily identifiable by the rental company stickers on the rear window of the vehicle. If possible, remove these stickers and always lock your car when leaving it unattended. Do not leave valuables unattended in vehicles. When visiting city center areas, park your car in a secure car park and retain the parking ticket on your person.
* Keep car doors locked while driving. Don’t leave luggage or valuables visible inside a parked car and don’t leave luggage on a roof rack. When picking up and dropping off your rental car, do not leave the keys in the ignition while loading or unloading luggage.
* When using ATMs, protect your PIN at all times and look closely at ATMs for evidence of tampering before use. Criminals may use small electronic devices attached to the outside of ATMs called “skimmers” to steal the ATM or credit card data.
* In busy areas, thieves use distraction techniques at ATMs, such as waiting until the PIN has been entered and then pointing to money on the ground or asking for loose change. While the ATM user is distracted, another person will quickly withdraw cash and leave. **If you are distracted in any way, cancel the transaction immediately.**
* When using credit cards to pay at restaurants, a portable card reader should be brought to your table. Restaurant staff should not take your card elsewhere to process a charge.
