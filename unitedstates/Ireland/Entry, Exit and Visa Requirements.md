# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Irelandâ€™](https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/washington/)s website for the most current visa information.

* You must have a valid passport to enter Ireland. U.S. citizens can enter visa-free for tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.
* There is no minimum passport validity requirement for U.S. citizens entering Ireland. We recommend you have a passport that is valid for the duration of your stay, evidence of sufficient funds to support your stay in Ireland, and a return airline ticket.
* **An increased number of U.S. citizens have been refused entry to Ireland or granted a limited stay because they failed to sufficiently demonstrate their travel intent to Irish immigration officials at the port of entry**. You may be asked to provide evidence of sufficient funds to support your stay in Ireland regardless of your purpose of travel. For any travel other than tourism, please ensure you obtain the appropriate documentation prior to travel. You can find more information at the [Irish Naturalization and Immigration Service website](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/) or by contacting your nearest [Irish Embassy or Consulate in the United States](https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/washington/).

**We cannot intervene on your behalf when applying for a visa or residency permit, nor can we assist if you are denied entry into Ireland.**

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Ireland is not a full member of the Schengen Area, which means that if you travel to Ireland from the Schengen Area, you are required to show your passport.
* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay** if you plan on transiting a Schengen country.
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/)

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Ireland or for foreign residents of Ireland.
