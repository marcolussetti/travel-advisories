**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* **Cars drive on the left side of the road in Ireland**. If you do not have experience driving on the left, you should be especially cautious as tourists driving on the incorrect side of the road are the cause of serious accidents each year.
* Road conditions are generally good, but once you exit the main highways, **roads are likely to be narrow, uneven, and winding**. Roads are more dangerous during the summer and on holiday weekends. Drivers should be attentive to cyclists and pedestrians, particularly in urban areas.
* Most intersections in Ireland use circular “roundabouts” instead of traffic lights, and it is important that drivers pay close attention to signs and yield the right of way to those already in the roundabout.
* **Most rental cars in Ireland have manual transmissions**; it can be difficult to find automatic transmission rental cars.

**Traffic Laws**: Police periodically set up roadblocks to check for drunk drivers. **Penalties for driving under the influence can be severe**.

* At stoplights, **turning on a red light is illegal**; you must wait for either a full green (any direction turn permitted) or directional green light (which could be straight, left, or right) before proceeding with caution.
* **You may use your existing U.S. driver’s license in Ireland for a temporary stay, up to one year**. Some insurance and car rental companies may request an International Driving Permit in addition to your existing driver’s license. To apply for an International Driving Permit, please contact the [American Automobile Association](https://cluballiance.aaa.com/?zip=20011&stateprov=dc&city=washington&devicecd=PC). You are required to apply for an Irish driver’s license if you become a resident of Ireland.
* **Travelers planning to drive to Northern Ireland are subject to UK traffic laws while in Northern Ireland**. Traffic signs may be different than in the Republic of Ireland. Consult the [United Kingdom Country Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/UnitedKingdom.html) for more information on traffic laws in Northern Ireland.

**Public Transportation**:

* Intercity bus and train services are generally good. Most large towns and cities are connected by rail or bus. Train and bus services are more limited in rural areas between small towns.
* City bus services are generally adequate, although many buses are crowded, frequently run late, and lines do not necessarily link easily. Pay close attention to bus stop locations in both directions, as the drop-off and pick-up locations could be several blocks away from each other.
* You can review available train, tram, and bus services through the National Transport Authority’s website [www.transportforireland.ie](http://www.transportforireland.ie/).
* Taxis are widely available in Dublin city center. Taxi rates vary by time of day and location. Ask your hotel for the number of a call-dispatched taxi service if you plan to be out during less busy times. Outside of Dublin, taxis are fewer, and it will likely be necessary to call a taxi company or use one of the several available rideshare apps operating in Ireland.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Ireland’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Ireland’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
