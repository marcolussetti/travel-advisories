# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Currency in Ireland:**The currency used in Ireland is the Euro. U.S. dollars are not legal tender in Ireland and are not an accepted form of payment. There are limited locations to exchange U.S. dollars when in Ireland, should you travel with cash.  Payment by credit card and Apple pay is widely accepted throughout Ireland. However, it is important to note that not all U.S credit cards are universally accepted. Most Irish banks will not accept U.S. $100 bills. Many Irish financial institutions no longer accept or cash traveler’s checks. **ATMs are widely available, but some, particularly in rural areas, may not accept debit cards from U.S. banks.**

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of **LGB**events in Ireland.

See our **LGB** [Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html) and section 6 of the Department of State’s [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Ireland prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. However, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what is offered in the United States.

* **Government Buildings**: Irish law requires access to government buildings for persons with disabilities, and this requirement is enforced. Under Irish law, public service providers should ensure the service is accessible to those with mobility, sensory, and/or cognitive impairments.
* **Parking**: On-street parking, public building parking lots, and internal parking lots always have a certain number of disabled spaces available. A permit is required to use these spaces, and information on applying for the permit can be found on the [Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland website](https://www.ddai.ie/parking-permit). Local authorities and commercial premises, such as shopping outlets, have no legal obligation to provide external disabled parking facilities for their customers.
* **Buses and Trains**: The majority of buses and trains in the main city areas of Ireland are now equipped for those with limited mobility, sight, or hearing disabilities, although some train stations and pathways may not be as easily accessible.
* **Mainline and Suburban Trains**: Portable ramps permit boarding from platforms to the carriages. These ramps are available at all terminal points and major junctions and stations that have staff on duty. They are also available on some trains. Travelers are advised to contact [Irish Rail](https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/travel-information/accessibility-onboard-trains) in advance to ensure such facilities are available. The website for [Dublin Bus](https://www.dublinbus.ie/home) provides information on its travel assistance scheme. Regional and intercity bus services are provided by [Bus Eireann](https://www.buseireann.ie/)
* **Private Businesses**: Accessibility in private businesses – such as hotels, bed and breakfasts, shops, and restaurants – varies widely. Travelers should inquire about accessibility issues with businesses before making reservations.
* **Disability Allowance**: People who live in Ireland and meet the medical conditions for a disability allowance may apply for free travel passes; there is also a blind/invalidity pension from the Irish Department of Social Protection for those who qualify.
