# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Customs:** Nauru's customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Nauru of items such as foodstuffs, animals, and pornographic materials. Please contact the Consulate General of Nauru in Melbourne, Australia via [e-mail](mailto:nauru.consulate@brisbane.gov.nr) for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Currency:** The Australian dollar is the legal currency in Nauru. You should be prepared to pay cash for hotel bills and all other services, because credit card services are not available.

**Special Circumstances:**Access to and from Nauru is limited to a small number of commercial air flights each week. Transportation may be interrupted due to weather, political or labor disputes, economic difficulties, and other reasons. If you travel to Nauru and an emergency arises, you should be prepared to remain in Nauru until the emergency passes or to arrange for a private air or sea charter from the island. Hotels are also limited and should be booked before arrival.

**Cyclone Season:**The official cyclone season is November through April. The [Fiji Meteorological Service](https://www.met.gov.fj/) maintains a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Nadi serving the Southwest Pacific Region. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available at the [State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html), as well as from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/) website.
