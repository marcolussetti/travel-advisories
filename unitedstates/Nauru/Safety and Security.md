**Criminal Penalties:**  Nauru has a low crime rate. However, visitors should not be complacent regarding their personal safety or the protection of valuables.

**Victims of Crime:**Report crimes to the local police by dialing 110 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +679 331 4466, or after hours at +679 772 8049. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.  
See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

* Provide a list of local attorneys

* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* Replace a stolen or lost passport

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.  
 **Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
