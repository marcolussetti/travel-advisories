For emergency services in Nauru, dial **110**for police, **111**for an ambulance or **112**for a fire.

* Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.
* There are few health care facilities available in the Republic of Nauru. The Republic of Nauru Hospital provides basic medical care. Medical care for routine problems is available, but not up to the standards of industrialized countries.
* On occasion, basic medications can be difficult to obtain.
* Those with serious illnesses or injuries typically require medical evacuation to Australia.
* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment
* injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.
