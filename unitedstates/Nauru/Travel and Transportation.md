**Road Conditions and Safety:**While in Nauru, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The main road circling the island is paved, but the remaining roads are unpaved. There is no organized roadside assistance, although there are a number of mechanics and car repair facilities on the island. Animals and pedestrians walking in the road make night driving hazardous. For specific information concerning Nauru driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, contact the Nauru Consulate General in Melbourne, Australia at telephone (613) 9653-5709, fax (613) 9654-4738, or via [e-mail](mailto:nauru.consulate@brisbane.gov.nr).

**Traffic Laws:**Traffic moves on the left in Nauru. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal in Nauru. Use of seatbelts is mandatory.**Public Transportation:**There are few taxis or buses in Nauru, but vehicles can be hired locally.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Nauru, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Nauru’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Nauru.html#ExternalPopup).

**Maritime Travel:** The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Nauru. Until those concerns can be addressed, the Coast Guard advises that mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Nauru should exercise caution.

Mariners planning travel to Nauru should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/)website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
