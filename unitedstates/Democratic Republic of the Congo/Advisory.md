**Updated to reflect the Ordered Departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and eligible family members and overall Travel Advisory Level from 3 to 4.**

Do not travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo due to **Armed Conflict, Crime**, **Civil Unrest, Kidnapping, and Terrorism**.

**Country Summary:** Due to risks in the country, on January 28, 2025, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and all eligible family members.

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, armed home invasion, kidnapping, murder, rape, and assault, is common and local police lack resources to respond effectively to serious crime. Assailants may pose as police or security agents.

Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash with each other. Civilians are frequently targeted in attacks in Eastern DRC. Terrorists and other armed groups have attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in DRC.

Demonstrations are common in many cities and some have turned violent. Police have at times responded with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.

The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security conditions.
