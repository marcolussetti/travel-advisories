***Updated due to changes to the Travel Advisory level, U.S. government restrictions on personnel, and information on armed conflict in North and South Kivu.***

Reconsider travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to**crime**, and **civil unrest**. Some areas have increased risk due to armed conflict. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel To:**

* **North and South Kivu provinces** due to **crime**, **terrorism**, **civil unrest**, **armed conflict**, and **kidnapping**.
* **Ituri province** due to **crime**, **civil unrest**, **terrorism**, **armed** **conflict**, and **kidnapping**.
* **Tanganyika, Haut Lomami, and the 3 Kasai provinces (Kasai, Kasai-Oriental, Kasai-Central)** due to **crime**, **civil unrest**, **armed conflict**, and **kidnapping**.
* **Mai-Ndombe province** due to **ethnic/communal violence**.

**Country Summary:**Violent crime is common. This includes armed robbery, armed home invasion, and assault. Local police lack the resources to respond to serious crime in a timely and adequate manner. Assailants may pose as police or security agents. DRC law enforcement does not always inform the U.S. embassy when they arrest a U.S. citizen. They may also delay access to detained or charged U.S. citizens. DRC law enforcement has used violence and threats during interrogations.

Demonstrations are common in many cities, and some have turned violent. Police may respond with force, resulting in deaths and arrests. Looting, assault, traffic obstruction, property damage, and other violent actions occur when police don't respond in a timely manner, or at all.

The U.S. government cannot provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security risks. Due to the risks in the country, minor dependents cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in the DRC.
