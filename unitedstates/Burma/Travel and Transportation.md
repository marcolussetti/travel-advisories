# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Rangoon's roads are generally in poor condition, and traffic is congested throughout the day. Slow-moving vehicles, bicycles, animals, and heavy pedestrian traffic create numerous hazards for drivers on Rangoon's streets. If you drive in Burma, remain alert to avoid hitting pedestrians. If you are a pedestrian, remain alert even when you believe you have the right of way.

Most roads outside of Rangoon have one to two lanes and are potholed, often unpaved, and unlit at night.  Many of the truck drivers traveling between China and Rangoon reportedly travel under the influence of methamphetamines and other stimulants. Drunken and/or drugged drivers are common during the four-day Buddhist water festival in mid-April.

Driving at night is particularly dangerous. Most Burmese drivers do not turn on their headlights until the sky is completely dark. Many do not use headlights at all. Many bicyclists use no lights or reflectors.

Roadside assistance and ambulances are generally unavailable.

**Public Transportation:** Please refer to our [Road Safety](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) page for more information.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the right side as in the United States, however, a majority of vehicles still have the steering wheel positioned on the right. The “right of way” concept is generally respected, but military convoys and motorcades always have precedence. Vehicles generally lack seat belts. Child car seats are unavailable.

Most accidents are settled between the parties on site, with the party at fault paying the damages. In the event of an accident with a pedestrian, the driver is always considered to be at fault and subject to fines or arrest, regardless of the circumstances.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burma, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Burma’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Burma should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at [MARAD](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/office-security/msci-portal/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
