# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Yangon traffic is congested throughout the day. Slow-moving vehicles, bicycles, animals, and heavy pedestrian traffic create numerous hazards for drivers on Yangon's streets. If you drive in Burma, remain alert to avoid hitting pedestrians. If you are a pedestrian, remain alert even when you believe you have the right of way.

Although major thoroughfares (e.g., the Yangon-Mandalay highway Expressway) have received government attention and undergone safety improvements, many roads in Burma are in poor condition and/or may be impassable after heavy rains. Many roads outside of Yangon have 1 to 2 lanes, are potholed, often unpaved, and unlit at night. Many truckers on these roads reportedly drive under the influence of methamphetamines and other stimulants. Drunken and/or drugged drivers are common during the 4-day, mid-April Buddhist water festival.

Driving at night is particularly dangerous. Drivers often do not turn on their headlights until the sky is completely dark. Many do not use headlights at all. Many cyclists use no lights or reflectors.

Traffic signage is minimal. Basic safety standards are not enforced.

Roadside assistance and ambulances are generally unavailable.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the right side of the road as in the United States. However, most vehicles still have the steering wheel positioned on the right side of the car. The “right of way” concept is generally respected, but military convoys and motorcades always have precedence. Vehicles generally lack seat belts. Child car seats are unavailable.

Most accidents are settled between the parties on site, with the party at fault paying the damages. In the event of an accident with a pedestrian, the driver is always considered to be at fault and subject to fines or arrest.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation (e.g., taxis, bus, and rail) is available in Yangon and some other parts of the country. Many trains and buses are overcrowded and can be old and poorly maintained. Because of nighttime curfew regulations throughout the country, intercity night buses often pull over to the side of the road during curfew hours with passengers remaining on the bus. The buses resume travel once the curfew is lifted. For these reasons, the U.S. Embassy discourages the use of these intercity night buses for its employees.

In Yangon, taxis are a more reliable method of transportation. They are generally safe but can be in poor condition and/or lack seatbelts. Take particular care when taking taxis late at night. To avoid confrontation or overcharging, negotiate rates with the driver prior to departure. Observe whether the driver seems impaired due to drinking or drugs. When in doubt, hail another taxi. Plan to return to one’s domicile 1 or 2 hours before curfew since taxis become scarce near curfew hours.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Burma’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Burma should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
