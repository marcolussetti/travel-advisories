**For emergency services in Burma, dial 119.**

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country or are unreliable.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

See our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [the Embassy of Burma](http://www.mewashingtondc.org/) to ensure that the medication is legal in Burma.

**Vaccinations**: Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/burma?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**: Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

**Health Facilities in General:** Most medical facilities in Burma are inadequate for routine medical care.

Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit cards are not accepted in most health care facilities and insurance will not be billed.

Adequate emergency medical services, including ambulance care, are not reliably available. Patients who are admitted to public hospitals typically need a family member or friend to assist them with care in the hospital, and food and medical supplies must be purchased for use in the hospital. Few medical personnel in Burma are trained to U.S. standards.

U.S. citizens needing urgent medical care have been denied treatment at private hospitals due to a lack of funds. Additionally, private hospitals will not provide care to victims of crime and certain types of accidents where questions of liability need to be investigated. Patients will be treated at public hospitals while law enforcement investigates the underlying liability questions. **In an emergency, you would likely need to be medically evacuated to a hospital outside Burma.** Medical evacuation from Burma is expensive and is most often transacted in cash, therefore medical evacuation insurance is advised.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Many pharmaceuticals on sale in Burma are counterfeit or adulterated. Some common medications may not be available. Travelers should bring their own medications for the duration of their stay in Burma.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:** Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are safer.
