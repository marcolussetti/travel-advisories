# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the U.S. [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Law enforcement officials do not routinely notify the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of U.S. citizens, and prison officials have been known to obstruct regular access by consular officers to U.S. citizen detainees. Review our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Should you be detained, especially outside of Yangon, we may not be able to assist quickly. Few police officers speak English. Police capability, responsiveness, and professionalism may appear inconsistent with U.S. standards. Police units are often under-funded, under-staffed, poorly equipped or trained, and suffer from limited resources and corruption. Many crimes go unreported or are not fully investigated.

**Dual Nationality:** The laws of Burma forbid citizens of Burma from possessing dual nationality. On occasion, Burmese authorities have detained and pursued criminal proceedings against Burmese-Americans who returned to Burma on U.S. passports with evidence of Burmese citizenship, such as a National Registration Card of Burma, in their possession.

**Tourists Must Reside in a Registered Hotel or Guesthouse:** Burmese law requires that foreign tourists reside in registered hotels or guesthouses. Criminal penalties, including multiple years of imprisonment and deportation, apply for non-compliance.

**Illegal drugs:** Illegal drugs, including marijuana, carry severe penalties. Expect long jail sentences under harsh conditions, heavy fines, or even execution for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs.

**Insulting Religion:** Under the law in Burma, insulting religion is a prosecutable offense. ‘Insult’ is a very broad term that could include tattoos or other religious representations in a non-religious context. Images of the Buddha can be particularly sensitive. In 2016, a tourist was deported for allegedly having a tattoo of the Buddha on his leg. In 2020, a Facebook user who criticized monks on social media was sentenced to over a year imprisonment. Two individuals were arrested for drawing graffiti of a skull wearing a monk’s robe. In 2023, a Swiss national and 14 others were arrested after posting a film online that authorities said insulted Buddhism. Visitors are encouraged to be respectful of local customs when visiting religious sites.

**Drones:** Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior permission from authorities and flying them can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. Particularly sensitive areas include government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings. Because it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable. Multiple foreigners have recently been detained, and 2 tourists were recently sentenced to a year in prison for flying drones over a park.

**Social Media:** The 2013 Telecommunications Law criminalizes “extortion of any person, coercion, unlawful restriction, defamation, interfering, undue influence, or intimidation using a telecommunications network.” You may be prosecuted for posting negative or derogatory comments on social media, including Facebook, under this law. If convicted, you may face a fine and/or imprisonment.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Burma under section 377 of the penal code, which has provisions against “sexually abnormal” behavior and entails punishments up to life imprisonment. Laws against “unnatural offenses” apply equally to men and women. These laws are rarely enforced; however, LGB persons have reported police using the threat of prosecution to extort bribes. LGB activists have also reported allegations of rape by security forces in some cases, arbitrary arrest (for example for loitering), detention, and broad societal and familial discrimination.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Burma prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. The law is not regularly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Individuals with disabilities should be prepared to face difficulties throughout Burma. Roads and sidewalks are often difficult to cross. Ramps or handicapped-accessible facilities are rare.

**Students:** Review our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:**Domestic violence against women in Burma, including spousal abuse, remains a serious problem. Abuse within families is prevalent and considered socially acceptable. Spousal abuse or domestic violence is difficult to measure because the military regime in Burma does not maintain comprehensive statistics and survivors are unlikely to report it. NGOs report regime investigators are insensitive to survivors of rape and sexual assault and rarely follow through with investigations or prosecutions.

Rape of women and men remains a significant problem. Rape of a woman outside of marriage carries a standard sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
