# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the U.S. [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Should you be detained, especially outside of Rangoon, we may not be able to assist quickly.

**Law enforcement officials do not routinely notify us of the arrest of U.S. citizens,** and prison officials have been known to obstruct regular access by consular officers to U.S. citizen detainees.

**Dual Nationality:** Burmese law forbids Burmese citizens from possessing dual nationality. On occasion, Burmese authorities have detained and pursued criminal proceedings against Burmese-Americans who have returned to Burma on U.S. passports and who have had in their possession evidence of Burmese citizenship, such as a National Registration Card.

**Tourists Must Reside in a Registered Hotel or Guesthouse:** Burmese law requires that foreign tourists reside in registered hotels or guesthouses. Criminal penalties, including multiple years of imprisonment and deportation, apply for non-compliance.

**Illegal drugs** carry severe penalties. Expect long jail sentences under harsh conditions, heavy fines, or even execution for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs.

**Insulting Religion:** Under Burmese law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offense. ‘Insult’ is a very broad term that could include tattoos or other religious representations in a non-religious context.  Images of the Buddha can be particularly sensitive. In 2016, a tourist was deported for allegedly having a tattoo of the Buddha on his leg. In 2020, a Facebook user from Meikhtila who criticized monks on social media was sentenced to over a year imprisonment; two other individuals were arrested for drawing graffiti of a skull wearing a monk’s robe. As in any country, visitors are encouraged to be respectful of local customs when visiting religious sites.

**Drones:** Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior permission from authorities and flying them in sensitive areas can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. Sensitive areas include government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings. Because it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable.  Multiple foreigners have recently been detained for flying drones in sensitive locations.

**Social Media:** You may be prosecuted for posting negative or derogatory comments on social media, including Facebook, under the 2013 Telecommunications Law, which criminalizes “extortion of any person, coercion, unlawful restriction, defamation, interfering, undue influence, or intimidation using a telecommunications network.” If convicted, you may face a fine and/or imprisonment.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal under section 377 of the Burmese penal code, which has provisions against “sexually abnormal” behavior and entails punishments up to life imprisonment. Laws against “unnatural offenses” apply equally to men and women. These laws are rarely enforced; however, LGB persons have reported police using the threat of prosecution to extort bribes. LGB activists have also reported allegations of rape by security forces in some cases, arbitrary arrest (for example for loitering), detention, and broad societal and familial discrimination.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Individuals with disabilities should be prepared to face difficulties throughout Burma. Roads and sidewalks are often difficult to cross. Ramps or handicapped-accessible facilities are rare.
