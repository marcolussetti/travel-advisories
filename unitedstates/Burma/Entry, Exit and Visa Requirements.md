# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

You should obtain the latest entry, exit, and visa requirements from the [Embassy of Burma](https://mewashingtondc.org/) or the [Ministry of Immigration and Population](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/). You may also visit the for [Ministry of Hotels and Tourism](https://tourism.gov.mm/) for additional information. Since the February 2021 coup, Burma’s military regime controls travel to, from, and within Burma. To enter Burma, you must have a valid passport with at least six months’ validity remaining and a valid visa. You should apply for your visa at a Burmese Embassy or Consulate in the United States or abroad before you arrive in Burma. When in country, you will be required to show your passport with a valid visa at all airports, train stations, and hotels. Security checkpoints are common.

**Visa Information:** Burma's [eVisa program](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) allows tourists and business travelers to apply for a visa online rather than physically applying at an embassy or consulate:

* You are generally notified within a few days whether you have been pre-approved for a visa.
* You must present the approval letter at Immigration when you enter Burma.
* Once you are approved for a visa, the visa needs to be used within three months.
* Apply at: [Myanmar eVisa (Official Government Website)](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/). Be aware that non-official websites may be fraudulent; beware of scams.

Burma has a [visas-on-arrival program](http://www.mip.gov.mm/portfolio/the-required-terms-and-conditions-for-visa-on-arrival/) for certain business travelers. The program is available only to those with a formal letter of invitation from a business registered with the Burmese Ministry of Commerce, NOT to tourists. Please contact the Embassy of Burma in Washington, DC, or other locations, for information.

There is also a meditation visa for visitors planning long-term studies at monasteries and meditation centers.

**U.S. Military Travelers:** Personal travel for U.S. military personnel to Burma is restricted at this time. U.S. military personnel must refer to the Department of Defense [Foreign Clearance Guide](https://apacs.milcloud.mil/fcg/loginForm.cfm) and their officer-in-charge for information before planning any travel.

**Dual Nationals:** Anyone entering Burma who has claim to Burmese citizenship, regardless of any other citizenship held, may need to meet all obligations of a Burmese citizen, including any required military conscription.

Burma’s military conscription law was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime. For more information, please refer to the Myanmar People’s Military Service Law (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 27/2010), also known as the Public Military Service Law. The military regime may refuse to acknowledge U.S.-Burmese dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, prevent their departure from Burma, and/or conscript them into the military. U.S.-Burmese nationals should consider this issue before traveling to Burma.
