# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Burma](https://mewashingtondc.org/) or the [Ministry of Immigration and Population](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) websites for the most current visa information. You may also visit the [Ministry of Hotels and Tourism](https://tourism.gov.mm/) web page for additional information.

Since the February 2021 military coup in Burma, the military regime controls travel to, from, and within Burma. To enter Burma, you must have a valid passport with at least 6 months’ validity remaining and a valid visa. You should apply for your visa through an embassy or consulate of Burma in the United States, abroad, or through the [eVisa program](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) before you arrive in Burma. When in Burma, you must show your passport with a valid visa at all airports, train stations, and hotels, and at security checkpoints throughout the country.

**Visa Information:** Burma's [eVisa program](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/) allows tourists and business travelers to apply for a visa online rather than physically applying at an embassy or consulate:

* You are generally notified within a few days whether you have been approved for a visa.
* Once a visa’s approved, you must use it within three months. You must present the eVisa approval letter at Immigration when you enter Burma.
* Apply at: [Myanmar eVisa (Official Government Website)](https://evisa.moip.gov.mm/). Be aware that non-official websites may be fraudulent; beware of scams.

There is also a Meditation Visa for visitors planning long-term studies at monasteries and meditation centers.

**Dual Nationals:** The law in Burma forbids citizens of Burma from possessing dual nationality. Anyone entering Burma who has claim to citizenship in Burma, regardless of any other citizenship held, may need to meet all obligations of citizens of Burma, including any required military conscription and service.

On February 10, 2024, Burma’s military regime began enforcing the People’s Military Service Law, requiring male citizens of Burma aged 18 to 35, and female citizens of Burma aged 18 to 27, to serve in the military for a period of two to three years, if notified by the military regime in Burma. The law extends the conscription age to 45 years old for males and 35 for females with specific expertise in certain professional occupations if called upon by the regime. For more information, please refer to the Myanmar People’s Military Service Law (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 27/2010), also known as the Public Military Service Law. The military regime may refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, prevent their departure from Burma, and/or conscript them into the military. U.S.-Burmese nationals should consider this issue before traveling to Burma. Visitors must show a passport with a valid visa at all airports, train stations, and hotels. Security checkpoints are commonplace outside of tourist areas and will also require showing a valid passport and visa.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Burma.

**U.S. Military Travelers:** Personal travel by U.S. military personnel to Burma is restricted at this time. U.S. military personnel must refer to the Department of Defense [Foreign Clearance Guide](https://apacs.milcloud.mil/fcg/index.html)and their chain of command for information before planning any travel.
