# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Messages regarding security-related events are posted on the [Embassy’s website](https://mm.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

Fighting between the Burma’s military forces and ethnic armed groups and militia forces continues in border regions, including parts of Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Shan, Rakhine, and Chin States, and as well as in Sagaing and Magway in the center of the country. Travelers should avoid travel to these areas.

The destinations frequented by most U.S. citizen visitors, including Rangoon, Bagan, Ngapali Beach, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay, are not currently affected by this fighting, but the security situation can change quickly. See our [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burma.html) for more information.

**Land mines and unexploded ordnance:** Conflict-affected areas are of greatest concern, particularly areas of Shan, Chin, and Kachin States. The location of landmines is often not marked or otherwise identifiable.

The regime’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism publishes information on restricted areas.

Due to travel restrictions placed on U.S. diplomats by the de-facto authorities, our ability to assist U.S. citizens affected by incidents in remote and/or conflict-affected areas of Burma may be limited.

**Crime:** Crime rates in Burma, especially involving foreigners, are lower than those of many other countries in the region. Nevertheless, the crime rate has been increasing, particularly home burglaries and petty crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. Citizens are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes) pages for more information.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 199 or in person at the police station in the district where the crime took place; and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(95) (1) 7536-509, ext. 4240, Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(95) 1 7536-509.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Disaster Preparedness**

* **Cyclones and Tropical Storms:** Cyclones may occur in two, three-month seasons peaking in May and November, respectively, during which travel conditions may deteriorate significantly. In addition, intense rainfall and squalls may occur during the rainy season (approximately June to October annually). Travelers are encouraged to prepare for cyclone emergencies and monitor local news stations when cyclones are forecast. The Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology has a color-coded system for storm systems: red for storms approaching landfall in Burma, orange for storms moving towards Burma, yellow for developing storms, and brown for current storms. Additional information on storm preparedness may be found on our [Crisis and Disaster Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) webpage.

* **Earthquakes** do occur throughout Burma. Check here for information about [earthquake preparedness](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html).

The Department of Homeland Security’s page has numerous resources on emergency kits, preparing for disasters and developing emergency plans: [https://www.ready.gov/.](https://www.ready.gov/)

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
