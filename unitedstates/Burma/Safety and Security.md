# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Messages regarding security-related events in Burma are posted on the [Embassy’s website](https://mm.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

Fighting between Burma’s regime military forces and ethnic minority armed groups (EAOs) and other opposition militia forces continues throughout the country. Prior to the coup, fighting between the country’s military and various EAOs and other militia forces within the country persisted in several regions, including parts of Kachin, Shan, Rakhine, and Chin states. Immediately after the coup, a nationwide pro-democracy protest and civil disobedience movement (CDM) attempted to disrupt Burma’s governing institutions. As the regime responded with mass arrests of political opponents and the employment of violence against peaceful protesters, fighting between EAOs and pro-democracy militias and the military escalated.

Fighting between the military regime’s forces and EAOs and opposition militia forces continues in parts of Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, and Chin States, and in Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway, and Tanintharyi Regions. You should avoid travel to these areas. Attacks by opposition militia on locations connected to the military and security authorities also regularly occur in Yangon and the capital city of Nay Pyi Taw. Local opposition militia groups actively operate around the country. Fighting is not limited to clashes between regime and opposition groups, and travelers are cautioned of the potential for the regime to limit access to highways and airports, causing an isolating situation. In October 2023, a group of 23 U.S. travelers were isolated in northern Shan State after a sudden increase in fighting. They were isolated for several days while coordinating with several local groups to navigate around numerous conflict areas. See our [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burma.html) for more information.

Do not travel in border areas between Burma and neighboring countries.  Those areas have a history of fighting. While armed opposition groups have not demonstrated any intent to target U.S. personnel interests, you may find yourself caught in the crossfire. Some groups have warned the populace in advance of planned or impending attacks.

The regime’s military and security forces continue to respond against civilian areas with military force, including artillery and air bombardments. The regime’s military and security forces also establish frequent checkpoints and engage in arbitrary arrests, detention of journalists and others, and conduct nightly neighborhood raids searching for pro-democracy actors and members of opposition forces.

**Landmines and unexploded ordnance:** Contested areas are of greatest concern for landmines, but landmines and unexploded ordnance have become an issue across Burma. The locations of landmines are not typically marked. In 2016, two German tourists were injured by a mine near rural Kyaukme township in northern Shan State. In 2019, two foreign travelers were injured after stepping on a landmine near the town of Hsipaw, a hiking spot for backpackers.

The regime’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism publishes [information on restricted areas](http://tourism.gov.mm/information/permitted-area/).

Due to the security situation, the U.S. Embassy’s ability to assist U.S. citizens in remote and/or conflict-affected areas of Burma is limited.

**Crime:** Crime rates in Burma, especially involving foreigners, are low. Nevertheless, the crime rate has been increasing, particularly home burglaries and petty crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. Take particular care when taking taxis late at night.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

Some social media and chat platforms are blocked by the military regime in Burma and can only be accessed while using a VPN.

GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Disaster Preparedness:**Cyclones may occur in two, three-month seasons peaking in May and November during which travel conditions may deteriorate significantly. In addition, intense rainfall and squalls may occur during the rainy season (approximately June to October annually). Travelers are encouraged to prepare for cyclone emergencies and monitor local news stations when cyclones are forecast. The Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology has a color-coded system for storm systems: red for storms approaching landfall in Burma, orange for storms moving towards Burma, yellow for developing storms, and brown for current storms. Additional information on storm preparedness may be found on our [Crisis and Disaster Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) webpage.

Earthquakes occur throughout Burma. Check here for information about [disaster preparedness](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html).

The [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.ready.gov/) has numerous resources on emergency kits, preparing for disasters, and developing emergency plans.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
