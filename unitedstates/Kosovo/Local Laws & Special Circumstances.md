# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Some laws are prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Notification of Arrest:** If police or prison officials arrest you, ask them to notify the U.S. Embassy. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information. See Embassy [Pristina’s arrest of a U.S. citizen page](https://xk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/).

The Kosovo criminal justice system differs from U.S. standards. Lengthy detentions are common before and during judicial proceedings. The U.S. Embassy cannot speed up legal proceedings or secure releases. It also cannot help detained U.S. citizens with preferential treatment.

**Special Circumstances**:

* Occasionally power outages can occur in Kosovo. They may disrupt public services.
* Kosovo is a cash economy that uses the euro. Credit cards are becoming more common. ATMs are common in Kosovo. Users should take normal precautions to protect their PIN.
* Be careful with public internet cafes and open Wi-Fi. Your sensitive info, like passwords, can be stolen.
* Travelers must declare, at their port of entry, cash of 10,000 euros or more. Failure to comply may result in the confiscation of a percentage of the funds.

**Natural Disaster Risk:** Kosovo is in a seismically active area. It is prone to earthquakes. The best way to cope with an earthquake is to prepare in advance. For information on what to do before and during a natural disaster, see:

* [U.S. Embassy Kosovo website](https://xk.usembassy.gov/).
* [The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) (FEMA) provides info on disaster preparedness.
* [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity.

**Explosive Devices:** Some areas in Kosovo still have unexploded ordnance and mines. Seek information through local authorities on marked and unmarked areas with leftover mines and unexploded ordnance. Report any suspicious item to the local authorities.

**Climbing and Hiking:** For outdoor activities, seek a local guide's advice. Stay in touch with family and friends. Provide your route and contact details to someone who is not traveling with you.

* Weather in Kosovo shifts suddenly, regardless of the season.
* Temperatures can drop overnight, and snow can fall unexpectedly.
* If in trouble, call the local emergency number at 112. Local authorities will help to the best of their ability.

**Athletes:** Some Kosovo sports clubs may not honor contracts. This has been reported by foreign players. Before signing a contract or relocating:

* Consult the Embassy's [information page](https://xk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/athletes/).
* Make sure you can afford your trip and return to the U.S. if problems arise.

**Property and other disputes:** The U.S. Government has no jurisdiction over property or private disputes in Kosovo.

* The U.S. Embassy cannot protect personal property and cannot take sides in legal disputes.
* The Government of [Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) website](https://www.gjyqesori-rks.org/?lang=en) has info on its legal system.

**LGB Travelers:** Kosovo has no laws against same-sex relations or LGB events. There are no legal barriers to organizing LGB events.

LGB individuals have anti-discrimination protections. In real life, LGB persons face discrimination. LGB travelers should be cautious if they choose to visit Kosovo. This is especially true for public displays of affection.

* Some police officers may not know the LGB community's needs. LGB travelers may find this a concern.

Please see our [LGB Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/lgbt.html)  page and the [Country Reports on Human Rights Practices](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Need Accessibility Assistance**. Access for disabled people differs from those in United States. There are anti-discriminatory laws in place which apply to jobs, education, health care, and state services.

* Support for disabled persons is limited.
* The law mandates access for disabled persons to official buildings. However, it is not enforced, and such access is rare.
* Most buildings have no access for proper support. Public transportation for such persons is very limited.
