# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

For most visitors, Kosovo remains a safe country. Petty street crime is the most common safety concern for U.S. citizens. The Kosovo Police, with help from The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and The Kosovo Force  KFOR, are responsible for safety in Kosovo. The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement authority.

Be aware that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments take measures against possible terrorist attacks, but the public is still vulnerable to transnational terrorists. Exercise caution at festivals and public events. If you are in a crowd and the security conditions worsen, leave immediately. Remain aware of your surroundings and have a plan for escape should an emergency arise. Monitor instructions from the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.

* U.S. Embassy personnel cannot travel to North Mitrovica, Leposavic, Zubin Potok, and Zvecan. There is violence and tension in those areas. The U.S. government warns private U.S. citizens against visiting them. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens who encounter difficulties in these areas.
* Organized crime is present in Kosovo, and it can lead to violent clashes between rival groups. Most incidents are politically motivated and are not directed at tourists or foreigners.
* Sporting related events may lead to violent clashes or protests.
* Celebratory gunfire and fireworks are common during holidays. Stray bullets and fireworks have caused serious injuries and deaths. Stay inside when watching fireworks to avoid potential hazards and stray bullets.

U.S. citizens should avoid protests and large gatherings. Demonstrations occur frequently, particularly in Pristina, often with little or no notice. Demonstrations can cause serious traffic disruptions or violent incidents.

**Crime:** While violent crime against U.S. citizens is rare, be aware of your public profile. Avoid drawing attention to yourself as a U.S. citizen. Theft and petty street crimes occur, especially in tourist areas.

* Do not leave anything of value in plain view in unattended vehicles. Park your vehicles in a secure, off-street location.
* **Street crime** and **home invasion** occur with some frequency. Criminals target the vulnerable and the wealthy. They exploit low police presence, such as on holidays and at big events, to commit opportunistic crimes. Securely lock the windows and doors of your residence when not home and set your home alarm if you have one.
* Robberies, thefts, and burglaries often rise sharply during year-end holidays. Criminals target shoppers with cash and gifts, which they store in their cars. If possible, avoid carrying and/or displaying large amounts of cash or packages.
* To avoid assault, be cautious when traveling alone in taxis or minibuses after dark. Avoid being alone in isolated areas with unfamiliar people. Do not leave drinks unattended in bars and nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**

Victims of crime or sexual assault should first find a safe place and then immediately call the local police to report the incident. After that, contact the U.S. Embassy.

Report crimes to the local police by calling 192. In an emergency, after calling the local police, you can contact the U.S. Embassy at +383 (38) 5959-3000 (available 24/7). Police responsiveness to criminal reports varies greatly. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

[Kosovo’s Victims’ Advocacy and Assistance Office](http://www.psh-ks.net/en/victims-advocacy-and-assistance-office/) (VAO) has a 24-hour, toll-free help line at 0800 11 112. The VAO provides information and guidance. It also allows the public and victims to report crimes. The VAO may help with medical exams, protection orders, or case updates.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizens who are victims of domestic violence may reach out to the embassy for help.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is not regulated. Inspections of equipment and facilities are rare. Hazardous areas may lack proper signage and staff lack proper training. Certification by the host government or recognized bodies may not exist. Injuries can be treated only in or near major cities. First responders usually can't reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
