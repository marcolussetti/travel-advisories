**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions in Kosovo differ from those in the United States. Some modern highways exist but most roads are still narrow and crowded. Mountain roads can be narrow and poorly marked and often lack guardrails. In bad weather, they quickly become dangerous. Dense fog can obscure visibility while driving.

* Driving in Kosovo is difficult for many reasons:unfamiliar traffic patterns and road signage; largely unobserved traffic laws (e.g., illegal left turns from the far-right lane, passing on blind curves, driving into oncoming lanes of traffic without yielding); stray livestock and horse-drawn carts; infrastructure problems and road construction/maintenance projects.
* **Roads frequently flood** and are impassible during rainy months. Mud and road slides occasionally shut down main throughways.
* Pedestrians must be very careful on sidewalks, when crossing streets, even at crosswalks. Drivers generally do not slow down or stop for pedestrians. For situational awareness, pedestrians are strongly advised not to use headphones.
* Residents often walk in the road at night. They wear dark clothes, making them hard to see. Additionally, stray dogs often lay or run in the roadway and are often difficult to see when driving.
* The U.S. Embassy recommends that you travel during daylight hours. Leave a travel itinerary and contact telephone numbers with someone before you go.

**Traffic Laws:** Drivers with a blood alcohol level higher than 0.05 percent are considered intoxicated and will be arrested and prosecuted.

* The use of seat belts and headlights is mandatory at all times.
* It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving unless it is hands-free.
* It is the law that all accidents, including minor fender-benders, be reported to police. If you are involved in any type of accident don’t move your vehicle. Wait until police arrive to take a full report.
* When police impose a fine or penalty, they may legally confiscate your driver’s license and vehicle documents until the penalty is paid. The U.S. Embassy is not able to retrieve these documents.
* Review Kosovo traffic safety laws for information on driver’s licenses and imported or foreign-tagged vehicle registration requirements.
* If your vehicle is registered outside of Kosovo, you will need to purchase liability insurance at the border. Kosovo is not a member of the European motor vehicle third party liability (“green card”) system.

**Public Transportation:** Taxis are an inexpensive, safe, and reliable means of transportation. Use established taxi companies that have metered taxies activated on departure.

* Rail transportation is very limited and unreliable.
* The public bus service in Pristina has a wide coverage area, however it is often overcrowded.

**Aviation Safety and Oversight:**There are no direct commercial flights to the United States by carriers registered in Kosovo. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Kosovo’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Kosovo is not a member of ICAO.
