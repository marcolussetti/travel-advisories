Kosovo has a public hospital in Pristina and private clinics around the country. **Medical facilities outside Pristina have limited services**. Quality controls are lacking and services are very basic. Hygiene may be insufficient. Medical care is below U.S. or Western European standards.

* **Kosovo has few ambulances**. Ambulances will take you to the public hospital. Injured or seriously ill U.S. citizens may have to take paid transportation to reach the nearest major hospital. They may not be able to wait for ambulances.

**The Embassy does not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

See our page on [Traveling with Prescription Medication.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) Check with [Kosovo](https://msh.rks-gov.net/)’s Ministry of Health for more information. Ensure your medication is legal in Kosovo. Carry your prescribed medication in original packaging along with your doctor’s prescription.

* Some prescription medication may not be available locally.
* **Tap water is not potable or safe to drink**. Make sure to cook food thoroughly to reduce the risk of food-borne illness.
* Air pollution is a severe problem in greater Pristina, especially in winter. Travelers with respiratory issues or asthma-like symptoms should consult a doctor before traveling.

**Vaccinations:** Check the [CDC web page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) on vaccine recommendations. Kosovo has no vaccines for children recommended by the CDC.

If you are planning on traveling from Kosovo to **Mecca**please be aware of the [MERS Corona Virus Advisory](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/coronavirus-saudi-arabia-qatar).

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
