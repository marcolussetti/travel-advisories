# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens need a valid passport to enter Kosovo. They may need to show documents stating the purpose of their visit.

U.S. citizens do not need a visa for trips lasting up to 90 days within a six-month period.

For work, study, or visits over 90 days in six months, you must apply for a temporary residence permit once in Kosovo. Visit [Pristina's Division for Foreigners, Visa, and Residence Permits](https://mpb.rks-gov.net/f/45/Temporary-residence-permit-for-foreigners) for additional information before your arrival in Kosovo.

To apply for a temporary residence permit, you must provide:

1. Proof of local health insurance.
2. A police background check.

Visit our Criminal [Records Checks page](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/abroad/legal-matters/criminal-record-check.html) and Embassy [Pristina’s local resources page](https://xk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/fingerprint-and-criminal-record-checks/) for additional details. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist you with a visa background check at the airport or if Kosovo denies you entry.

Kosovo law requires U.S. citizens to show photo ID (original ID, a driver's license, or a passport) to authorized officials if asked.

Under Kosovo law, unaccompanied children under age 14 must provide notarized, written permission from both parents to leave the country. This applies to all nationalities. Please review [our website](https://xk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-and-family-matters/) for more information on children’s issues.

**Travel to Serbia:** To visit Serbia from Kosovo, you must have a valid, recent Serbian entry stamp and have entered Kosovo through Serbia. Serbia will bar U.S. citizens from entering Serbia if they entered Kosovo from any country except Serbia. This includes arrivals via Pristina's airport. To enter Serbia without a recent Serbian entry stamp, you will need to enter from another neighboring country.

Visit the [Embassy of Kosovo](https://ambasadat.net/Shba) website for the most current visa information.

The U.S. Department of State knows of no HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Kosovo.
