**COVID-19 Testing:** Brazil is a very large, diverse country with varying medical resources, both private and public, throughout the country. Many private labs perform COVID-19 testing at various prices, typically between $20 and $100.  PCR, serology-based antibody tests, and antigen tests are available.  Turn-around time varies widely depending upon location. Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test.  Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo and Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Testing is available in the private sector without a doctor’s prescription, but a prescription may be required for insurance payment.

In the public healthcare system, each Brazilian state has its own COVID-19 testing plan. We recommend that you [contact local/state authorities for more information.](https://br.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/) Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free.  Information on testing sites and procedures is available through the [official app of the Ministry of Health.](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unasus.gov.br%2Fnoticia%2Fministerio-da-saude-disponibiliza-aplicativo-sobre-o-coronavirus&data=05%7C01%7CFentonLM%40state.gov%7Cc2aedf07341748978fed08db6604c6a8%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638215942937888235%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qemjcbKtalqw8QThhpN1jojOVeRNEouLa082mBHjrRo%3D&reserved=0)

**COVID-19 Vaccines:** The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Brazil once they register with the public Unified Health System (SUS)*.* According to the Ministry of Health, available vaccines include AstraZeneca/Oxford (Fiocruz), CoronaVac (Butantan), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and Pfizer (BioNTech). For more information on local availability of COVID-19 vaccines, please see the [Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br) and also contact [local health authorities](https://br.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

**For emergency services in Brazil, dial 192.**

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in state capitals and other large cities.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Government of Brazil](http://beirute.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/f.a.q._-_traveling_to_brazil.xml) to ensure the medication is legal in Brazil. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Though the yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, travelers wishing to be vaccinated should consider receiving it prior to travel, as local supplies are limited. Please note that the yellow fever vaccine should be administered ten days prior to travel for it to be effective.

Also note that, while yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, some neighboring countries (French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Bolivia, and Paraguay) do require travelers with recent entries in Brazil to show proof of yellow fever vaccination.

All travelers to the country are advised to carry documentation, such as a vaccination card, that they have been appropriately vaccinated for yellow fever.

**Elective Surgery**: Although Brazil has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Brazil, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Some “boutique” plastic surgery operations offer luxurious facilities but are not hospitals and are unable to handle emergencies.

Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Brazil.

Non-traditional Medicine: Several U.S. citizens have died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Brazil. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities if seeking such services.
