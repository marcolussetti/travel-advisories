# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States.  In certain areas, pedestrians have minimal access to sidewalks and are forced to walk along the sides of busy roadways.  There are very few bicycle lanes designated for cyclists, and drivers are unaccustomed to sharing the road with cyclists.  Beirut streets and highway lanes are known for their heavy traffic congestion and aggressive driving.  Lanes are generally unmarked, and roads outside the capital may be poorly lighted.

Drivers generally will find inter-city directional signs and street markers, but side roads often are unmarked.An international driver’s license is required for visitors to Lebanon.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Drivers must carry a valid driver’s permit, registration and proof of insurance while driving.  Licenses are issued to those at least 18 years of age.
* Drivers must obey speed limits and traffic lights, and yield to ambulances, fire engines, and other emergency vehicles.
* Radar detection devices are prohibited.
* Seat belts are compulsory for both front and rear passengers in all vehicles, and helmets are mandatory for cyclists and motorcycle riders.
* A hazard triangle in the vehicle is mandatory.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs is prohibited, as are open alcohol containers in a vehicle
* Cell phone use while driving is prohibited, except with a hands-free system.
* Children under the age of 5 must be secured in a car seat, and children under the age of 10 may not sit in a front seat or be carried on a motorcycle.

**Public Transportation:** In general, public transportation in Lebanon is safe and buses operate throughout the country.  Taxis are widely available and rideshare services are also active in Lebanon.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Lebanon’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight.  FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of the Damascus Flight Information Region (FIR). The FAA advises caution for flights operating in the airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus FIR due to heightened military activity in or around Syria.

For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Lebanon should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings)**.**

The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the safety practices in the ports of Lebanon.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the U.S. Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Lebanon should exercise caution.
