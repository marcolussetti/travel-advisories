# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**  Across the world, terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad and resort to various methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles  – frequently on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

In Lebanon, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks and military operations related to the regional crisis. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Lebanon. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to occur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.  Even in the wake of the most recent conflict between Hizballah and Israel, Hizballah maintains a strong presence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. In addition to the threat of Hizballah-conducted terrorist activity, Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Assad regime in Syria.

**Avoid the Lebanon-Syria border region:** The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region because of past clashes, extremist activity, and the potential for these to recur at any time.

**Avoid the Lebanon-Israel border region, Beirut’s Dahieh suburb, and the Bekaa valley:** Since October 2023, the Israel-Lebanon border region has seen continuous, intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hizballah along the Blue Line (a line separatingIsrael from Lebanon and the Golan Heights), which has killed and injured civilians caught in the crossfire. In September 2024, Israel intensified its air campaign against Hizballah throughout the country, to include the Dahieh suburb of Beirut and the Bekaa valley,as well as initiating a limited ground operation in South Lebanon that have killed and injured civilians, including women, children, journalists, medical workers, and first respondersIsrael and Lebanon announced a cessation of hostilities in November 2024 to be followed by a 60-day implementation period of Israeli withdrawal and Lebanese deployment. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid in particular Beirut’s Dahieh suburb, the Bekaa valley, areas south of the Litani River, and especially the Lebanon-Israel border area. Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all marked areas.

**Avoid travel to refugee settlements:**  Violence within refugee settlements has resulted in shootings and explosions. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to refugee settlements. Palestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in formal and informal refugee settlements in different areas of the country.

**Crime:** Reported crime rates in Lebanon are moderate but rising. Violent crime and sexual assault are rare but do occur. Petty theft -- such as pickpocketing and purse snatching -- occurs in crowded public areas. More recently, the dire economic situation is engendering a significant increase in economically motivated crimes, including home invasions and car thefts. Police are responsive but often unable to affect a positive outcome.

Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Protests often occur spontaneously with little to no advance warning.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lebanon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Lotteries
* Work permits/job offers

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.
