For emergency services in Lebanon dial 112.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay the medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Lebanon Ministry of Health](https://www.moph.gov.lb/en/Pages/3/3010/pharmaceuticals) to ensure the medication is legal in Lebanon.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.

**Water Quality:**In all areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Beirut, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always accepted; most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment, often in U.S. dollars.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may have limited English proficiency.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Due to the current economic situation in Lebanon, many medications are not available in pharmacies and medical facilities.
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication outside the United States. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable **establishments**.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moph.gov.lb/en/Pages/3/3010/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9) to ensure the medication is legal in Lebanon.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) websites for more information.
