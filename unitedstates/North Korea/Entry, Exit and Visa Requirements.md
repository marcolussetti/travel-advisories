# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**U.S. passports are not valid for travel into, in, or through the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)** **due to the** **serious and mounting risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. citizens in North Korea.** Those traveling on U.S. passports in North Korea should have already departed North Korea. Those who wish to travel to North Korea on a U.S. passport after this time must obtain a special validation in a limited validity passport under [22 C.F.R. 51.64](https://www.govregs.com/regulations/title22_chapterI_part51_subpartE_section51.64), which will be granted only under very limited circumstances. U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizen nationals abroad can apply for this special validation at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.

**With a special validation to enter North Korea in a limited passport:** one to three months validity to enter North Korea. If you enter and depart North Korea through China, six months validity on your passport with multiple entry/exit visas for China. Note: you cannot enter North Korea through the Demilitarized Zone from South Korea.

**If you enter North Korea without a special validation:** the Department of State can revoke your passport for misuse under 22 C.F.R. 51.62(a)(2). Further, you may be subject to felony prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1544 for misuse of a U.S. passport.
