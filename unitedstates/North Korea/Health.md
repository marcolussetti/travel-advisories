**If you have medical problems, do not travel to North Korea:**

* Medical facilities in the DPRK lack resources and electricity.
* Medical personnel have inadequate or outdated skills.
* Hospitals in Pyongyang can perform basic examinations and lifesaving measures, but functioning x-ray facilities are not generally available.
* Avoid surgery.
* If you have an accident outside Pyongyang, transport back to the capital can be lengthy and without medical assistance.
* Hospitals will expect immediate U.S. dollar cash payment for medical treatment**.**
* **You cannot use credit cards or checks in the DPRK.**

**Carry your regular medication with you along with the doctor’s prescription:** DPRK Customs says that most prescription medication may be brought into the country with no restrictions.

**Medical Evacuations: Local DPRK hosts are often not aware of options available for medical evacuations and might claim that no such options exist.**

* Insist on contacting the Embassy of Sweden, which will attempt to arrange flight clearances for air ambulances performing emergency medical evacuations.
* Costs for medical air evacuation vary, but according to SOS International, an evacuation from Pyongyang to Beijing averages approximately USD 40,000 including medical personnel (1 doctor and 1 nurse), the aircraft, and clearance costs.
* The General Bureau of the Koryo Civil Aviation of the DPRK says that it provides around-the-clock service and that requests for air clearance will be granted within 24 hours.
* If a U.S. citizen with a medical emergency is in Pyongyang, the Embassy of Sweden can usually arrange a medical evacuation to Beijing in one day.  If the patient is located outside Pyongyang, it will take longer.
* Medical evacuation by regularly scheduled airlines can be arranged, but very few flights operate from Pyongyang to Beijing (Air Koryo and Air China), Shenyang (Air Koryo), or Vladivostok (Air Koryo).
* Air Koryo flights go to Shanghai only on a charter basis in the tourist season (April-October).
* In order to transit China, Chinese visas for injured foreigners and any escorts must be obtained prior to the evacuation from North Korea. Even in the case of a medical emergency, transit visas may take several days to arrange.

**Evacuation across the DMZ to South Korea is not allowed.**

**Vaccinations:**Information on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection are located at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the [CDC Internet site.](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/clinician/none/north-korea) For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the [World Health Organization's (WHO) website](http://www.who.int/countries/prk/en/). If you have special dietary requirements, you are advised to bring food with you to North Korea, as the restaurants available to foreigners have limited menus that may not meet your dietary needs.

You can find useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas insurance programs, on the [Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs website.](http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html)

Also, see our extensive tips and advice on [Traveling Safely Abroad*.*](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html)

**Bills - We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas: The DPRK says U.S. citizens are accountable for costs associated with detention or incarceration in North Korea such as lodging, food, telephone calls, and medical assistance (hospital bills).

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
