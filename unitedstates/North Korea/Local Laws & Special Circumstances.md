# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**LOCAL LAWS**

**Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Embassy of Sweden immediately**. See our [webpage](/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information

**Educate yourself about North Korean law**. The North Korea legal system is an instrument of state power and not an independent branch of the government.  Protections guaranteed under the U.S. legal system do not apply, and your U.S. passport does not confer special status. Your local host/liaison may be able to provide useful guidance. However, do not assume your host will provide assistance to you if you are arrested, or that any information you shared with your host will not be turned over to North Korean authorities.

**Criminal acts unique to North Korea:**

* Showing disrespect (both physically and verbally) to the country’s former leaders, Kil Il Sung or Kim Jong Il, or the country’s current leader, Kim Jong Un including but not limited to tampering with or mishandling materials bearing their names or images such as money, newspapers, or political slogans in Korean
* Entering North Korea without proper travel documentation
* Possessing material, printed or digital including e-book readers, DVDs, USB drives, documents, literature, audio and video files that is critical of or hostile to North Korea
* Proselytizing or carrying out religious activities, including activities that may be construed as such, like leaving behind religious materials, either intentionally or unintentionally
* Engaging in unsanctioned political activities
* Unauthorized interacting with North Koreans
* Taking unauthorized photographs
* Having unauthorized conversations with North Koreans
* Traveling without authorization even for short distances
* Exchanging currency with an unauthorized vendor
* Shopping at stores not designated for foreigners
* Bringing pornography into the country

**No Expectation of Privacy:**

* All electronic and multimedia devices including USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, Internet browsing histories, and cookies are subject to search for banned content.
* Personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.
* If  DPRK authorities permit you to keep your mobile phone when you enter the country, it will not function unless you use the DPRK mobile service, which will enable DPRK authorities to monitor your calls.  GPS-trackers and satellite phones are not allowed.
* A host or minder will keep track of you.
* Removing or tampering with political slogans and signs or pictures of political leaders.

**Criminal Penalties:**At least 16 U.S. citizens have been detained in North Korea in the past ten years. While in North Korea, you are subject to North Korean laws.  If you violate North Korean laws, even unwittingly, you may be:

* Held in isolation without charges for lengthy periods of time,
* Interrogated without counsel,
* Compelled to draft public confessions,
* Tried,
* Convicted,
* Sentenced, and
* Sent to a labor camp for years**.**

Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

**Press:** North Korea officials watch journalists closely to prevent them from unauthorized conversations with North Koreans or questioning the policies, actions, or public statements of North Korea’s leadership.

* North Korea has confiscated objectionable material from foreign journalists.
* Journalists who engaged in activities that challenged the regime have been deported, arrested, or detained to face criminal charges.
* For additional information on the lack of freedom of information in North Korea, see the Department of State’s [Human Rights Report for North Korea](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/).

**U.S. Government Economic Sanctions Against North Korea:** North Korea remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world.

* The government of North Korea and the Workers’ Party of Korea are blocked persons, and U.S. citizens may generally not engage in transactions with them or with their property.
* Most exports to North Korea are subject to licensing by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security.
* The importation and exportation of goods, services, and technology from or to North Korea are generally prohibited unless authorized by the [Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/nkorea.aspx) and, for exports or goods, the [Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security.](https://www.bis.doc.gov/)

**UN Security Council statements November 17, 2017:** For information on the United States and the United Nations Security Council concern regarding escalating tensions from the recent  missile launch, and other activities prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolutions, see [UN website](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0).

**Customs Regulations:** North Korean authorities may seize documents, literature, audio and video files, computer equipment, DVDs, USB drives and other digital media, and letters deemed by North Korean officials to be pornographic or intended for religious proselytizing or subversive activities**.**   [Please see our information on customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/customs.html).

**Dual Nationality:**  North Korea does not recognize dual nationality.  If you are of Korean heritage – even if you are a U.S. citizen – you could be subject to ten years of military service in North Korea and taxes on foreign source income.  Please see our information on [Information on Dual Nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html).

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations because same-sex sexual relations are considered a foreign phenomenon.  DPRK claims that there are no LGB individuals in the country. It would therefore not be possible to organize an LGB event here.

Additionally, any open demonstration of affection is frowned upon, as well as between opposite sex couples.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of the [Department of State's Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Persons with Mobility Issues***.* Hotels and medical facilities are generally accessible. However, pavements/curbs are high.
