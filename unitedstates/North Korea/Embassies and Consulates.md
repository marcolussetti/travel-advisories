# Embassies and Consulates

[#### Embassies and Consulates](javascript:void(0); "Embassies and Consulates")

* The Department strongly urges U.S. citizens not to go to North Korea/the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention.
* North Korean authorities, under North Korea’s system of law enforcement, impose unduly harsh sentences--including for actions that in the United States would not be considered crimes.
* They also threatened U.S. citizens with being treated in accordance with the “wartime law” of the DPRK.

See[Travel Advisory for North Korea](/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/north-korea-travel-advisory.html)**.**

**Sweden as Protecting Power**:  Since the United States does not maintain diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea, the U.S. government has no means to provide normal consular services to its citizens:

* Sweden serves as the protecting power for Canada, Australia, and the United States, providing limited emergency consular services.
* North Korea still routinely delays or denies consular access to U.S. citizens, even when requested by the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang and despite North Korea and the United States both being signatories to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations**.**
