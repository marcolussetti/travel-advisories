# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and copycat organizations aspire to attack U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists often use knives, firearms, and vehicles to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists and/or foreigners
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Malaysia remains a transit point and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for members of terrorist groups. Information from credible sources suggests that there is a continued risk of armed terrorist and criminal groups operating and planning attacks against foreigners, including U.S. citizens, in the East Asian and Pacific region, including Malaysia.

Use caution in eastern Sabah. Dangers include kidnappings-for-ransom, criminal violence, and terrorist activities. Criminal or terrorist groups may target tourist resorts or attack boats carrying tourists.

Due to safety concerns, U.S. government employees may not travel to eastern Sabah in most circumstances. They may travel to the following areas with some restrictions: the cities of Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, the Sepilok Nature Reserve, and the Kinabatangan River areas. “Eastern Sabah” is considered everything east of the north-south line drawn from the cities of Kudat to Tawau, including all islands.

Due to the security situation, there are dusk-till-dawn curfews at sea in the coastal areas around Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna, Sandakan, Kinabatangan and Beluran. Check local media or ask local police for the most recent curfew information.

**Crime:**  Petty theft and crime in Kuala Lumpur continue to be concerns. The most common crimes are purse snatchings, pickpocketing, smash-and-grab thefts, and residential burglaries. These crimes are committed against locals and foreigners alike. Avoid wrapping purse straps around arms or shoulders to avoid injury. Violent and more serious crimes are less common. Taxi drivers in central Kuala Lumpur have perpetrated violent crimes against passengers. It is safer to use a ride-hailing app or book a taxi by phone rather than hailing a taxi on the street. This is particularly true after dark.

Criminals sometimes rob motorists stuck in traffic or stopped at a light. Keep valuables out of sight while driving and remove them from the car when parked. Do not leave GPS devices on the windshield or dashboard.

**Demonstrations occur frequently.** They can occur due to political issues, on holidays, or during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. It’s best to avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Local law pertaining to peaceful assembly **prohibits**non-Malaysians from participating in public protests.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Sophisticated internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Malaysia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings or dating profiles. Sometimes they start with unsolicited emails, letters, text messages, or social media messages. Scammers frequently pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by calling 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +60 3-2168-5000. We encourage crime victims to obtain a police report from local authorities. For advice on how to file a police report, call the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Operations Center in Kuala Lumpur at +60 3-2115-9999 or 3-2266-2222. In some areas, there are small "Tourist Police” stations. Staff at these Tourist Police stations are familiar with helping international visitors. Remember that only local officials have the authority to investigate and to prosecute a crime.

**Domestic Violence:** If you are a U.S. citizen and a victim of domestic violence, contact the Embassy at +60 3-2168-5000. Local “One Stop Crisis Centers” are in all government hospitals. They offer medical care, temporary shelters, legal aid, and counseling. These services are available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse.

**Tourism:** Malaysia regularly checks safety standards across the tourism industry. Clear signs identify hazardous areas and activities. Professional staff are usually there to help with organized activities. Medical care is widely available throughout the country if you get hurt. In remote areas, particularly in the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, first responders may take longer to reach patients than in large cities.

We encourage U.S. citizens to get medical evacuation insurance.
