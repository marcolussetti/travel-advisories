# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You must follow local laws. If you break them, even by accident, you could be expelled, arrested, or jailed. Get information from local authorities before starting a business or job that requires additional permits or licenses.

Penalties for using, having, or selling illegal drugs in Malaysia are much harsher than in the United States. You could face the death penalty, long jail sentences, and/or heavy fines.

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings in Malaysia, such as military facilities, government buildings, and Ministry of Health facilities, like public hospitals and clinics.

Driving under the influence can land you in jail immediately.

Some white-collar crimes are punishable by caning.

If you buy or collect local plants or animals without permission, you could face heavy fines, expulsion, or jail time.

It is illegal to give religious literature of another faith to Malaysian Muslims. Special religious authorities and local police sometimes raid popular nightspots and hotels to stop activities that go against Muslim religious custom, like drinking alcohol and adultery.

Some crimes are punishable in the United States, no matter what local laws say. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for more information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are common in many countries. However, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You will have to pay fines or give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers) website for more information.

**Currency:** Currency exchange and Western Union money transfers are easy to find. Credit cards are accepted throughout the country but be aware of the risk of fraud. If possible, make sure your credit card remains in your sight during every transaction. ATMs can be a safer way of obtaining local currency than a currency exchange or money transfer. However, PINs in Malaysia are six digits long. Some travelers have reported trouble using four-digit PINs at ATMs.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** Malaysia’s laws make homosexual acts illegal. Punishments can be up to 20 years in prison and/or whipping. Police sometimes raid nightclubs and events that are popular with LGB travelers. Same-sex marriages and civil unions performed in other countries are not legally recognized. Some Malaysian states have Islamic Sharia laws that apply to male and female Muslims. These laws make same-sex activity illegal with punishments up to three years in prison and whipping. LGB persons might face discrimination or violence, especially in more conservative rural areas. Visit our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers With Disabilities:** Malaysian law prohibits discrimination against people with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. However, the law is not always enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is similar to the United States. Accessibility is common in government facilities, information, and services, but can be limited in public transportation, older lodging, and older public infrastructure. Newer lodging, communication/information, and newer public infrastructure may be more accessible. Accessibility is more limited in rural areas.

Malaysia has an active NGO community focused on disability welfare and protection. They can provide information and help with employment services, assistive devices and equipment, chore services, companion-based services, day services, and support network for parents.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Sexual Violence:** If you are a victim of sexual assault, go to the nearest major hospital right away. Public hospitals offer a “one-stop” response, including medical care, forensic testing, help filing a police report, legal assistance, counseling, and temporary shelter. Most private hospitals do not offer mental health or counseling services, but U.S. citizens might find better and faster care at private hospitals in Malaysia. However, if a victim of crime wants to take legal action against the perpetrator, they must visit a public hospital for forensic evidence collection.  See additional travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).
