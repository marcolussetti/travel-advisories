**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road safety is a very serious safety concern in Malaysia. In 2023, about 600,000 traffic accidents occurred in Malaysia, resulting in 6,443 deaths. It is one of the most dangerous countries to drive in. The main cause of traffic accidents is undisciplined motorcycle and motor scooter operators. They make up nearly two-thirds of all traffic deaths. Motorcyclists often do not follow traffic laws and drive without considering their safety or that of others. Use turn signals well in advance to alert motorcycles when you are turning.

Traffic jams are common in major cities because road construction has not kept up with the increase of vehicles. Multi-lane highways often narrow down into two-lane roads, causing congestion. Many streets are narrow and winding. Traffic is heavy during the morning and afternoon rush hours and slows down a lot when it rains. Monsoonal rains can quickly flood roads in low-lying areas.

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic in Malaysia moves on the opposite side of the road to the United States. Most vehicles have the steering wheel on the right side. By law, you must wear your seat belt in both the front and back and must not use your cell phone while driving (unless it is hands-free). Turning left at a red light is not allowed unless there is a sign that says it is. Always carry your passport or Malaysian identification card when driving.

If you are involved in a traffic accident:

* Call the police immediately. Depending on how serious the accident is, call either the emergency number 999 or the Royal Malaysia Police Operations Center in Kuala Lumpur, +60 3-2115-9999 or +60 3-2266-2222.
* Stay in your car and wait for the police to arrive before exchanging information with other people involved in the accident.

Reports of road rage incidents, especially after midnight, are increasing. Avoid confrontational behavior if you are in an accident. If you are threatened, stay in your car and lock the doors. If you can, leave the scene and file a report with the local police within 24 hours.

**Sobriety Checkpoints:** Laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced. Violations carry serious penalties. Police operate sobriety checkpoints in many entertainment districts frequented by expatriates. At these checkpoints, all drivers must submit to alcohol breath tests. If you fail a breath test, you will be arrested.

**Driver’s License Requirements:** You can use an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with a valid U.S. license to drive in Malaysia. You must get the IDP outside of Malaysia. If your IDP or U.S. license has expired, you must obtain a local driver’s license. Some visa holders may be eligible for a process called “conversion” to get a local license. For information on this process, please contact the [Malaysian Ministry of Transportation](https://www.jpj.gov.my/). The Ministry of Transportation recommends engaging a local driving school to help with the paperwork. To obtain a local license, you also need a valid long-term visa or work permit.

Many car rental agencies in Malaysia will rent vehicles for a short term to U.S. citizens with only a valid U.S. driver’s license. However, if you plan to drive in Malaysia, obtain an IDP before leaving the United States. For information on how to obtain an IDP, visit the [Driving Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/driving.html) section of the Department of State website.

**Public Transportation:** There have been fatal and other serious accidents involving long-distance tour buses in Malaysia, especially at night or in bad weather. If you plan to travel by bus, choose a reputable company, and avoid overnight routes.

Taxis are metered, but many drivers refuse to use the meter and charge much higher rates, especially during peak hours, when it is raining, or when the destination is in a busy area. By regulation, metered fares go up by 50 percent between midnight and 6:00 a.m.; meters automatically show the higher fee during these hours. Many people prefer booking taxi or ride services through popular smartphone apps for convenience and clear pricing. If you are visiting Malaysia by cruise ship, use taxis or tour operators that have an official relationship with the cruise company.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that the government of Malaysia’s Civil Aviation Authority meets the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for overseeing Malaysia’s air carrier operations.
