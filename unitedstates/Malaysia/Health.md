For emergency services in Malaysia, dial 999. When you call for emergency assistance, the dispatcher will connect you to a government hospital of their choice. To get emergency care at a private hospital in Malaysia, call that hospital's emergency hotline. Alternatively, you can arrange your own transportation to the hospital.

Ambulance services are:

* Ambulances are widely available. However, training and availability of emergency responders may not meet U.S. standards.
* Ambulances are not equipped with the latest medical equipment.
* Travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance. Sometimes they can take 45 minutes or longer to arrive.

**The Department of State, U.S. Embassies, and U.S. Consulates do not pay for medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance covers you overseas. Some care providers overseas only accept cash payments. All hospitals and clinics require payment prior to providing care to foreigners. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/malaysia) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend getting [MEDEVAC insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation. This is separate and in addition to health insurance.

Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging. Also carry the original prescription. Check with the [Royal Malaysian Customs Department](https://www.customs.gov.my/en/)to make sure the medication is legal in Malaysia.

**Vaccinations:** Make sure you are up to date on all CDC-recommended [vaccines](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/malaysia).

**Air Quality:** Air quality in Malaysia changes often and fluctuates with the seasons. It is usually the worst in the dry season from July to October because of large agricultural fires in the area. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Medical Facilities and Services:**

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country but health care in rural areas may not meet U.S. standards.
* Hospitals will require advance payment before treating a patient even if they have insurance.
* Medical staff in rural areas may speak little English.
* In public hospitals, there is only minimal staff available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having a family member stay overnight with the patient, especially if the patient is a minor child.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities. Hospital-based care is typically only available through government institutions and is not to U.S. standards.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism in Malaysia is growing rapidly. Medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Consult your local physician before traveling for medical treatment. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/health-care-abroad/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/health-care-abroad/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Malaysia.
* We strongly recommend [MEDEVAC insurance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Malaysia.
* The quality of care can vary widely in elective or cosmetic surgery facilities. If you plan to have surgery in Malaysia, make sure that emergency medical care is available, and providers are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Be careful when buying medication overseas. Medicines, whether over the counter and or prescription, are often easy to buy in Malaysia. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, be the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Only buy medication after consulting with a medical professional and from a reputable place.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration make the rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought overseas must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. It must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#:~:text=If%20a%20drug%20is%20approved%20for%20use%20in,for%20you%2C%20or%20during%20trips%20outside%20the%20U.S.) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy**

* Please review our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html) page if you are planning to have a child by ART or surrogacy.
* Even though some surrogacy agencies or clinics say surrogacy is legal in Malaysia, there is no legal system for foreigners or same-sex couples to do so. Surrogacy agreements with gestational mothers are not legal and will not be enforced by Malaysia courts.
* If you choose to become a parent using a surrogate mother in Malaysia, the local authorities will not recognize you as the legal parent and you will need to adopt the child.

**Water Quality**

In many areas, tap water is not reliably safe to drink. Bottled water and drinks are usually safe but be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled water. Ice for drinks might be made from tap water.
