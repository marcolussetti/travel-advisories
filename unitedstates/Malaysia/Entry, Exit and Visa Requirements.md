# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

To enter Malaysia, your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond the date of your arrival. You must have at least one blank page for the entry stamp. The Malaysian Immigration Department grants permission to enter and remain in the country. Visit the websites of the [Embassy of Malaysia in Washington D.C](https://www.kln.gov.my/web/usa_washington). or the [Malaysian Immigration Department](https://www.imi.gov.my/index.php/en/home/) for more information. You do not need a Malaysian visa if you are coming for business or tourism for 90 days or less.

Upon arrival, all travelers must complete the [Malaysian Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main). Permanent residents of Malaysia, long term-pass holders, and diplomatic and official passport holders are exempt from this requirement.

For the latest information, travelers should review the [Malaysian Immigration website](https://www.imi.gov.my/index.php/en/main-services/syarat-kemasukan-ke-malaysia-en/). You can submit an [online inquiry form](http://eapp.imi.gov.my/tanya/create) or contact the Malaysian Government call center (MyGCC) at +60 3-8000-8000. If you are outside of Malaysia, contact the nearest Malaysian embassy or consulate for visa questions.

Other countries in the region also require your passport have at least two blank pages or more and be valid for six months beyond entry. Please be sure to check your passport validity carefully before traveling.

At the border, officials will stamp your passport with a “social visit pass” (visa), allowing you to stay up to 90 days. You can apply to the Malaysian Immigration Department for extensions, and they are not guaranteed. You must exit Malaysia using the same passport that you used to enter. If you get a new passport while you are in Malaysia, you must apply for a special exit permit from Immigration authorities. This permit will go in your new passport and will be required to leave Malaysia.

The U.S. Government and the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur cannot help you apply for a Malaysian visa. We cannot advocate for your admission into Malaysia if you are denied entry.

**Travel Document**: Travelers using a Refugee Travel Document (issued by USCIS) must get a visa before traveling to Malaysia. You may not arrive at the border in Malaysia without a visa. Contact your nearest Malaysian Embassy or Consulate to apply for a visa.

**Border Crossings:**  Follow all instructions for entering the country. Be sure your passport is stamped with the correct date when entering and exiting the country. Incorrect documentation or proof of entry into Malaysia can result in serious penalties. Be sure not to stay beyond your allowed time, usually 90 days for U.S. citizen tourists.

**Autogate:** U.S. citizens who registered for a Malaysia Digital Arrival Card can use the autogate at some Malaysian airports. The autogate lets travelers scan their passport and walkthrough an automated gate for immigration clearance. U.S. citizens using the autogate will not get an entry stamp in their passport. **Sabah and Sarawak:** You must show your passport to enter or exit the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo. This is true even if you travel on a domestic flight to or from another part of Malaysia.

**Dual Nationality:** Malaysia does not recognize or permit dual nationality. If local authorities learn you are a U.S.-Malaysian dual national, they may make you give up your U.S. passport or you risk losing your Malaysian citizenship. U.S.-Malaysian dual nationals should consider this seriously before traveling to Malaysia. See our [dual nationality page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) for more information.

**U.S.-Israeli Dual Nationals:** Malaysia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. U.S.-Israeli dual nationals have reported problems at Malaysian border control when showing their Israeli passports. U.S.-Israeli dual nationals should use their U.S. passports to depart the last country on their itinerary prior to arriving in Malaysia.

**Visa Overstays:** Malaysian immigration authorities take visa violations very seriously. They regularly fine and arrest foreigners who overstay their social visit passes (visas). Contact the Immigration Department of Malaysia if you overstay your visa. You will only be allowed to leave the country after resolving the overstay.

Carry your passport with you at all times. Authorities may want to see the entry stamp in your passport to confirm you are in the country legally. If you entered Malaysia using an autogate and don't have an entry stamp, explain this to the local authorities you meet. U.S. citizens who cannot prove their nationality and legal status may be arrested. Be prepared to show your passport with a valid entry stamp. Detentions may last from a few hours to several weeks. Strictly follow immigration laws and regulations while in Malaysia. Check your visa status regularly while in the country.
