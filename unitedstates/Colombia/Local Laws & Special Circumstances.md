# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or expelled.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

**Customs Regulations**: If you enter or exit Colombia possessing cash or other financial instruments worth more than $10,000USD, you must declare them and be able to prove the legal source of the funds. The Embassy has received reports of customs officials confiscating high-value jewelry that was not declared upon entry.

Colombian law prohibits tourists and business travelers from bringing firearms and ammunition into Colombia. Colombian law also restricts the importation of plants and animals (and some related products).

**Artifacts**: Colombian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes. U.S. customs officials are obliged to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116)website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Colombia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions. Colombian law may require that released offenders serve a lengthy period of parole in-country, during which the offender is given no housing and may lack permission to work.

Colombia uses comprehensive screening procedures to detect narcotics smuggling at its international airports. Travelers are occasionally questioned, searched, fingerprinted, and/or asked to submit to an abdominal X-ray upon arrival or departure. Most airport inspectors do not speak English.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips)  for more information.

**LGB Travelers**: Colombia has one of the strongest legal frameworks in Latin America defending the rights of LGB people; however, in practice protections remain a long way from full enforcement and harassment persists, especially in rural areas. In many parts of Colombia, violence against trans people exceeds levels of violence against any other members of the LGB community. Criminals do utilize dating apps to target potential victims of theft, so travelers should use caution on such apps. Certain regions, especially in rural areas, experience higher instances of harassment/violence against LGB communities. In 2022, there was an uptick of homicides specifically targeting gay men in Medellín. LGB associated and friendly establishments exist mostly in metropolitan areas, especially Cartagena, Medellin, and Bogota.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Colombia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, but the law is not fully enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Many public places and transportation are not adapted to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. The most common types of accessible facilities may include restrooms, ramps, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, including sidewalks, intersections, buses, and taxis. There is a significant difference between the capital (and other large cities) and the rest of the country.

Repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices are available. Sign language interpreters or personal assistants are available for hire.
