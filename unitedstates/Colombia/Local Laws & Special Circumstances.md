* U.S. customs officials must confiscate pre-Columbian objects and some colonial religious art. It is illegal to bring them into the United States.

**Arrest notification**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Many law enforcement authorities will not notify the Embassy. Few police officers speak English, especially outside of large cities. Review our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* Migration officials sometimes question, search, and fingerprint travelers.

**LGB Travelers**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations, the provision of information or services to persons on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation, or the organization of events focused on sexual orientation in Colombia.

Colombian law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, protections are not always enforced:

* Criminals use dating apps to target potential victims for robbery or assault, so use caution on such apps.
* Violence and harassment targeting persons on the basis of sexual orientation remains high, particularly in rural areas.
* Places catering to lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons are mostly found in big cities, especially in Cartagena, Medellín, and Bogotá.

* Common types of accessible facilities may include restrooms, ramps, and elevators.
* Expect limited accessibility in:
  + Public transportation
  + Hotels and buildings
  + Communication and information
  + Sidewalks
  + Intersections
* There is a big difference in accessibility between large cities and the rest of the country.
* Repair and replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices are available.
