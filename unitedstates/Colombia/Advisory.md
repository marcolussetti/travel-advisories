**Reissued with updates to the country summary.**

Reconsider travel due to **crime** and **terrorism**. Exercise increased caution due to civil **unrest** and**kidnapping**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel to:**

* Arauca, Cauca (excluding Popayán), and Norte de Santander departments due to crime and terrorism.
* The Colombia-Venezuela border region due to crime, kidnapping, and risk of detention when crossing into Venezuela from Colombia.

**Country Summary:** Violent crime, such as homicide, assault, and armed robbery, is widespread. Organized criminal activities, such as extortion, robbery, and kidnapping, are common in some areas.

Terrorist groups and criminal organizations continue operating and carrying out attacks in Colombia. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, police stations, military facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, airports, other public areas, and U.S. government facilities.

Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country and can be about a variety of political or economic issues. They can shutdown roads and highways, often without prior notice or estimated reopening timelines. Demonstrations and road closures may significantly reduce access to public transportation and may disrupt travel within and between cities. Protests can become violent and can result in fatalities and injuries.

U.S. direct-hire government employees must adhere to the noted restrictions:

* They are not permitted to travel by road between most cities.
* Colombia’s land border areas are off-limits to U.S. government personnel unless specifically authorized.
* They may not use motorcycles.
* They may not hail street taxis or use public buses.

**Arauca, Cauca, and Norte de Santander Departments – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is widespread.  
Terrorist groups are active in some parts.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens as U.S. government-personnel travel to these areas is severely restricted due to security concerns.

**Colombia - Venezuela Border – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

U.S. citizens are advised not to travel to the border of Colombia and Venezuela. U.S. citizens are at risk of detention when crossing into Venezuela.

The Colombia-Venezuela border is not clearly marked, and U.S. citizens should not go near the border due to the risk of crossing into Venezuela accidentally.

U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. For more information, see the Venezuela Travel Advisory.
