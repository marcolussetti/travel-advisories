[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Emergency Phone Numbers**Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Dial 123** for all emergencies in Colombia.

Contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombia at +57 (601) 275-2000 or +57 (601) 275-4021 after hours to report crimes or emergencies.

**Terrorism**Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They use simple methods of attack like knives, explosives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting events, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants visited by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation (subways, buses, trains, and commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html).

**Crime**Crimes and scams against tourists in Colombia are common:

* Individuals seen as wealthy are the primary targets.
* Well-organized crime occurs in cities and affluent neighborhoods.
* Firearms and knives are common in Colombia. Criminals use these in muggings and robberies under the threat of violence.
* Ride-by robberies of cell phones, bags, and valuables are common.
* Thieves often spot victims by their visible jewelry, fancy wristwatches, and expensive clothes.
* Crimes can happen while victims are in public (malls, restaurants, and airports).
* Narco-trafficking groups, including the Clan del Golfo, often attack civilians and security forces.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Demonstrations can be frequent in the capital city, Bogotá.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.

**How to Stay Safe**U.S. citizens must always be aware of their surroundings:

* Check local news and reports
* Keep a low profile and do not flash wealth (cell phones, cash, jewelry, etc.)
* Avoid demonstrations

**Kidnapping**The Embassy sometimes receives reports of U.S. citizens being kidnapped for ransom in Colombia:

* Kidnappers may force victims to use multiple ATMs to get money.
* They may ask relatives or friends to wire money through banks , and sometimes hold victims for long periods.
* Always tell friends and family your plans, including where and when you’ll arrive or leave places.
* Give your trusted contacts a unique "alert word" to use if you’re in danger during a phone call.
* Avoid isolated or unfamiliar areas, stay alert to suspicious behavior, and contact local authorities if you feel threatened.

**Dating apps (robberies, murders, and disabling drugs)**Criminals use dating apps to attract victims. They ask to meet in hotels, restaurants, and bars. Many U.S. citizens in Colombia have been drugged, robbed, and even killed by Colombian criminals posing as dates. They often work with accomplices. If using dating apps or websites in Colombia:

* Let your friends and family know where you are.
* Meet in a popular public place.
* Avoid locations where you can be isolated (hotel rooms, private apartments, or houses).
* Tell your family or friends the details about the person you are meeting and on which site you met them. Include a photo.
* Set up a video call in the initial stages.
* Never leave food or drinks unattended at a bar or restaurant.
* Observe the preparation of your food or drink order when possible.
* Refuse offers of food or drinks from strangers.
* Provide a local number to friends and family members in case of a drugging.

**Scams**Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Colombia. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) page and the [FBI’s page on scams](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) for information.

Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to. Instead of helping, tell them to call the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can work with local authorities or through other channels to assist them.

* If you use credit or debit cards, check for unauthorized transactions.
* Limit the amount of cash you carry in public and keep in your checking account.
* Stay alert when withdrawing cash from ATMs.
* Avoid ATMs located on the street.
* ATMs inside banks, shopping malls, or other protected locations are preferable.

U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis hailed on the street.

Use a dispatch service or car service app whenever possible.

**Ayahuasca (hallucinogens)**

Ayahuasca is marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing”:

* It contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong, illegal psychedelic drug. It is banned in many other countries, including the United States.
* Risks while intoxicated include robbery, assault, illness, or death.
* People claiming to be shamans, or spiritual practitioners, are neither licensed nor regulated.

**Technology Usage Abroad**Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

* GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Venezuelan Border**Traveling to Venezuela via Colombia is dangerous and the border isn’t always clearly marked. The U.S. Department of State has categorized Venezuela as **Level 4: Do not travel**. U.S. citizens are at risk of detention any time they enter Venezuela. Venezuelan authorities do not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens, and the U.S. government is not granted access to detained citizens. The U.S. government has no ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.
