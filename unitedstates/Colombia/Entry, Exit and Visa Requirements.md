[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Travelers must complete Migración Colombia’s [Online Check-Mig Form](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.migracioncolombia.gov.co%2Fpre-registro&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C07513867b3aa488e8ca808db82feb929%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638247802755911753%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=G%2Fk1mDShlFfT75ufYum4u6dRKfEbeDm%2FLFgXQmt8HPk%3D&reserved=0) within 72 hours of boarding an inbound or outbound flight from Colombia. There is no fee to complete the form.

All U.S. citizens who do not also hold Colombian citizenship must present a valid U.S. passport to enter and leave Colombia. U.S. citizens do not need a Colombian visa for a tourist or business stay of 90 days or less, or for cumulative stays of 180 days or less per calendar year. Before your 90-day stay expires, you may request an extension of up to 90 additional days from the Colombian immigration authority ([Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/)). You will face a fine if you remain in Colombia longer than allowed, and you may not be able to leave Colombia until the fine is paid.

Any traveler entering with a Colombian visa of any type (as opposed to visa-free entry described above) with more than three months’ validity must register the visa at a Migración Colombia office or online within 15 days of arrival in Colombia or face fines. You may be denied entry to Colombia if you do not have a return ticket. Visit the [Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism](https://colombia.travel/en/practical-information/visas-and-embassies) website for the most current visa information.

Visit the [CDC Traveler View](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia) website for vaccination information, and the [Colombian Ministry of Health](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/salud/publica/PET/Paginas/Fiebre-amarilla.aspx) website for Yellow Fever vaccination requirements.

**Special Entry/Exit Instructions for U.S. Citizens Born in Colombia:** All Colombian citizens—regardless of dual citizenship—MUST present a valid, non-expired Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia. Colombian citizens traveling with non-Colombian passports may be unable to depart the country until they obtain a Colombian passport.

Be aware that any person born in Colombia or of Colombian parentage may be considered a Colombian citizen, even if never documented as such.

Be aware as well that all U.S. citizens, regardless of dual citizenship, must present a valid U.S. passport upon returning to the United States. Persons who are both U.S. and Colombian citizens MUST travel between these countries with both passports, presenting the Colombian passport upon departing Colombia and the U.S. passport upon arrival in the United States.

**Additional Exit Requirements for Minors:**  To prevent international child abduction, Colombia has implemented special exit procedures for Colombian children under 18 (including dual nationals) who depart the country alone, without both parents, or without a legal guardian.  For detailed information regarding exit requirements for minors with Colombian nationality please visit [Migración Colombia's website](https://unidad-administrativa-especial-migracion-colombia.micolombiadigital.gov.co/servicios-de-control-migratorio/salida-de-menores-del-pais) (in Spanish only).

**Lost or Stolen Passport:** If your U.S. passport is lost or stolen in Colombia, you must [obtain a new](https://co.usembassy.gov/passports/) one before leaving the country. You can report the loss or theft on the Colombian National Police [website](https://www.policia.gov.co/).

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Colombia.
