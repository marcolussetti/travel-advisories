* You must show a valid U.S. passport to enter and leave Colombia if you are not a Colombian citizen.
* U.S. citizens do not need a Colombian visa for tourism or business if staying for 90 days or less. The same applies to cumulative stays of 180 days or less per calendar year.
* Before your 90-day stay expires, you can request a 90-day extension from [Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) (Spanish only). You face a fine if you stay in Colombia longer than allowed. You may not be able to leave until you pay.
* If you have a Colombian visa valid for over 3 months, you must register it at a [Migración Colombia](https://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/) office or online within 15 days of arrival or face fines.
* You may be denied entry to Colombia if you do not have a return ticket.

**Special entry and exit instructions for dual U.S.-Colombian citizens**

U.S.-Colombian citizens must travel with both passports. They should use their Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia, and their U.S. passport for entry into the United States:

* Colombia may consider anyone born in the country, or with Colombian parents, a citizen.
* U.S. citizens (with or without Colombian citizenship) must show a valid, non-expired U.S. passport upon returning to the United States.

All Colombian citizens (with or without U.S. citizenship):

* Must show a valid, non-expired Colombian passport for entry and exit.
* Cannot leave the country without a Colombian passport.

**Exit Requirements for Minors**

* There are exit rules for Colombian children under 18 (including dual nationals).
* If traveling without both parents or a legal guardian, please check all exit requirements. Children who do not meet the exit requirements have been kept by the Colombian child welfare agency for weeks before being allowed to return to the United States.
