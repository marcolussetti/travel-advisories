For emergency services in Colombia, dial 123 from any mobile phone or land line.

**Ambulance services** are available in larger cities, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Travelers can check with the Embassy of Colombia in the United States to ensure the medication is legal in Colombia.

**Vaccinations**:  Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Visit the [CDC Traveler View](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia) website for vaccination information, and the [Colombia Ministry of Health](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/salud/publica/PET/Paginas/Fiebre-amarilla.aspx) website for Yellow Fever vaccination requirements. Childhood vaccinations are required by [Colombian law](https://www.icbf.gov.co/cargues/avance/docs/ley_1098_2006.htm) for children ages six and under.  Visit the [Ministry for Health and Public Safety website](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/proteccionsocial/Paginas/EsquemasdeVaunaci%C3%B3n.aspx) for a list of required childhood vaccinations.

**Air Quality**: Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://co.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health Facilities in General**:

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment upfront prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is frequently, but not always, available.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**:

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Colombia.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications or repatriation in the case of untimely death.
* Your legal options in cases of malpractice are very limited in Colombia.
* Although Colombia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Colombia, carefully research the doctor and recovery facility you plan to use. Make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and that professionals are accredited and qualified. Share all health information (e.g. medical conditions, medications, allergies) with your doctor before surgery.

**Pharmaceuticals**:

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) websites for more information.
* Colombia does not allow the sale of certain psychiatric medications.  Travelers should carry a sufficient supply for their trips. Please review the Colombian government’s [open data website](https://www.datos.gov.co/Salud-y-Protecci-n-Social/MEDICAMENTOS-VITALES-NO-DISPONIBLES/sdmr-tfmf/data) for drug unavailability.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**:

* If you are considering traveling to Colombia to have a child through the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is currently neither prohibited nor permitted under Colombian law. Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Colombia, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same sex intending parents and gestational mothers may not be enforced by Colombian courts.

**Water Quality**:

* In rural areas, tap water may not be potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude**:

* Many cities in Colombia, such as Bogota, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).

**Adventure Travel**:

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-the-extreme).

**General Health**:

HIV/AIDS: Travelers should bring medication sufficient for their entire stay.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) regarding specific issues in Colombia.

**Air Quality**:

* Air pollution is a problem in several major cities in Colombia. Consider the impact smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:  
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
