**Emergency numbers  
Dial 123** for medical emergencies.

**Ambulance services**Ambulances are available in large cities.

* First responders may lack training.
* In an emergency or serious injury, travelers may prefer to take a taxi or car to the hospital rather than an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the [CDC’s Health Advice for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) to Colombia.

**Medical insurance**The U.S. government including Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates **do not** pay medical bills.

* U.S. Medicare/Medicaid doesn’t work overseas.
* Make sure your insurance plan works overseas. The [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) provides more information on types of insurance available.
* Most hospitals and doctors overseas don’t accept U.S. health insurance.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Credit card payment is not always available. Most care providers overseas only accept cash.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Healthcare**Adequate healthcare facilities are available throughout the country. However, healthcare in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.

* Hospitals and doctors may ask for payment upfront before admission. Credit card payments may not be accepted.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients cover the costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in larger cities. Hospital-based care is only available through government institutions.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://co.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any medical provider or clinic.

**Prescriptions**You must carry prescription medications in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Embassy of Colombia](https://www.colombiaemb.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Colombia.

**Medical tourism and elective surgery**:  
Medical tourism is a fast-growing industry.

* U.S. citizens seeking healthcare abroad should know that medical systems are different from those in the United States.
* Consult your doctor before traveling for medical reasons.
* Learn about the risks of [medical tourism](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) from the CDC and find out how to prepare before traveling Colombia.
* Colombia has many elective and cosmetic surgery facilities that are like those found in the United States. The quality of care varies widely.
* U.S. citizens **have suffered serious complications and even died** from cosmetic or other elective surgeries.
* Travelers should buy [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover evacuation for unexpected medical issues.
* You have limited legal options in case of malpractice in Colombia.

If you plan to undergo surgery in Colombia:

* Research the doctor and recovery facility you plan to use.

**Pharmaceuticals**:

* Be careful when purchasing medication overseas:
* Pharmaceuticals are usually easy to buy with few controls.
* Counterfeit medications are common and may not work or be dangerous.
* Purchase medication in consultation with a medical professional and from trusted places.
* You must follow the law if you are bringing medication back to the United States. The medication must be for personal use and approved in the United States. Get more information from [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications).
* Colombia does not allow the sale of certain psychiatric medications. Travelers should bring enough supply for their trips.

The Department of State provides information on [ART and surrogacy abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

* Courts may not enforce surrogacy agreements between foreign or same sex intending parents and gestational mothers.
