# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Traffic Law**

**Road conditions and safety**Due to Colombia's security and infrastructure, U.S. government employees and their families cannot:

* Use public transportation or travel by road outside cities at night.
* Hail street taxis.
* Use motorcycles.

You should follow these same precautions.

Road travel in Colombia can be dangerous, especially at night:

* Some roads are poorly maintained.
* Roads can get damaged due to heavy rains and mudslides.
* Mountain roads may lack safety features such as crash barriers or guard rails.
* Heavy fog can make driving dangerous.
* Highways may not have lights or signs showing destinations.
* Slow-moving buses and trucks stop in the middle of the road suddenly.
* In the countryside, livestock is often herded along roads or left to graze on roadsides.
* Due to a lack of sidewalks, roads are also used by pedestrians and bicyclists.

The use of motorcycles and bicycles is widespread throughout Colombia.

**Traffic laws**Traffic laws are often ignored and rarely enforced. This creates dangerous conditions for drivers and pedestrians.

You must follow all local laws:

* Seat belts are required for all passengers in a private vehicle.
* Car seats are required for children.
* Children under 10 years old are not allowed to ride in the front seat.
* It is against the law to use a cell phone while driving.
* If you are involved in an accident, you must stay at the scene without moving your vehicle until the police arrive. This rule is strictly enforced.
* Under Colombian law, moving a vehicle or leaving the scene of an accident can be seen as admitting guilt.

**Public transportation**Do not wave down taxis on the street.

* U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis hailed off the street.
* Use a dispatch service or transportation app whenever possible.
