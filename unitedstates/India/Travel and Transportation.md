**Road conditions and safety**  
  
Travel by road in India is dangerous.

* India leads the world in traffic-related deaths, and several U.S. citizens have died in recent traffic accidents.
* Exercise extreme caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas.
* Use cars with seatbelts. They are not common in 3-wheel taxis (autos) and the back seats of taxis and rideshare vehicles.
* Always wear helmets on motorcycles and bicycles.
* Traveling at night is particularly dangerous.

**Assume other drivers will not respond to traffic situations like in the United States**

* Buses and trucks often run red lights and merge into traffic at yield points and traffic circles.
* Cars, autos, bicycles, and pedestrians are only slightly more cautious.
* Use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence; it is both common and wise.

**Road Conditions**

* Roads, inside and outside major cities, are often poorly maintained and congested.
* Main roads frequently have only 2 lanes with poor visibility and inadequate warning signs.
* Divided highways may have local transportation traveling in the wrong direction, often without lights.
* Expect heavy traffic, including overloaded trucks and buses, scooters, pedestrians, bullock and camel carts, horse or elephant riders, bicycles, and loose livestock.

**Public transportation**

* Buses serve almost every city and are convenient but can be driven fast and recklessly, leading to frequent accidents.

**Traffic laws**

* To drive in India, you need a valid Indian driver’s license or a valid international driver’s license. A U.S. driver’s license is not valid.
* Traffic in India moves on the left.
* Be alert while crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark.
* Use seatbelts in both rear and front seats where available and ask drivers to maintain a safe speed.
* Consider hiring a local driver due to difficult road and traffic conditions.

**Accident safety risks**

* If a driver hits a pedestrian or a cow, the vehicle and its occupants are at risk of being attacked by bystanders.
* Such attacks pose significant risk of injury or death and could result in the vehicle being set on fire.
* It may be unsafe to remain at the scene of such an accident. Seek out the nearest police station.
* The Department of State provides information on [Road Safety](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html).

**Protests and road blockages**

* Protestors often block roads to publicize complaints.
* Check local news reports for any road disturbances

**Aviation safety oversight**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that India’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. [FAA’s website](https://www.faa.gov/) includes more information on its assessment program.
