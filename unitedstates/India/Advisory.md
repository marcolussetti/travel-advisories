***Updated to reflect information on the northeastern states.***

Exercise increased caution in India due to **crime** and **terrorism.** Some areas have increased risk.

Do not travel to:

* The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (except the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh) due to **terrorism** and **civil unrest**.
* Within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border due to the **potential for armed conflict**.
* Portions of Central and East India due to **terrorism.**
* Manipur due to **violence** and **crime**.

Reconsider travel to:

* The northeastern states due to **terrorism** and **violence**.

**Country Summary:** Indian authorities report that rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has happened at tourist sites and other locations.

Terrorists may attack with little or no warning. They target tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in rural areas. These areas stretch from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal. U.S. government employees must get special authorization to travel to these areas.

**Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Terrorist attacks and violent civil unrest are possible in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Do not travel to this state (with the exception of visits to the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh). Violence happens sporadically in this area and is common along the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan. It also occurs in tourist spots in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam.  The Indian government does not allow foreign tourists to visit certain areas along the LOC.

**India-Pakistan Border – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

India and Pakistan have a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official border crossing for non-citizens of India or Pakistan is in Punjab. It is between Attari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan.  The border crossing is usually open, but check its current status before you travel. To enter Pakistan, you need a Pakistani visa. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise, apply for a Pakistani visa in your home country before traveling to India

**Portions of Central and East India – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Maoist extremist groups, or “Naxalites,” are active in a large area of India that spans from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal. Attacks against officers of the Indian government continue to occur sporadically in the rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand that border with Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. Southwest areas of Odisha are also affected. The Naxalites have carried out many terrorist attacks, targeting local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials.

Due to the fluid nature of the threat, U.S. government employees are required to obtain permission prior to traveling to most areas in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Meghalaya, and Odisha. Permission is not required if employees are traveling only to the capital cities of these states.

U.S. government employees also need approval to travel to the eastern region of Maharashtra and the eastern region of Madhya Pradesh

**Manipur -  Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Do not travel to Manipur due to the threat of violence and crime.  Ongoing ethnic-based civil conflict has resulted in reports of extensive violence and community displacement. Attacks against Indian government targets occur on a regular basis.  U.S. government employees traveling in India require prior approval before visiting Manipur.

Visit our website for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html).

**Northeastern States – Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

Ethnic insurgent groups occasionally commit acts of violence in parts of the northeast. These incidents include bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets. There have been no recent reports of violence in Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim, or Tripura.

U.S. government employees traveling in India require prior approval before visiting the states of Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as when visiting any areas outside of the capital cities of Assam, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Tripura.
