# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**All U.S. citizens need a valid passport as well as a valid Indian visa or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to enter and exit India for any purpose. India may deny entry to travelers without valid documents or the correct type of visa.** Indian visa rules and instructions change often. They often do so with little warning. Travelers should check the [website of the Indian Embassy in Washington D.C.](https://www.indianembassyusa.gov.in/pages/NzU) before any travel to India to review the most current information. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in India cannot assist you if you arrive without proper documentation.

U.S. citizens seeking to enter India solely for tourist purposes for stays of less than 60 days may apply for an eVisa at least four days before their arrival. E-tourist visa varies in number of years valid and is only permitted for entry at [certain international airports and seaports.](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fboi.gov.in%2Fboi%2Fpublic%2Fvisaservise&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C3d26bbe5c4b74f91940c08dd7de80b27%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638805157750011099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FtXide3jHTuDTZoD3vkuZi%2FWEuRt%2FVTGeCMBXxO2cuE%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/visaservise.

Please visit the [Indian government's website for electronic travel authorization](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html) for more information and to submit an application visit the [Bureau of Immigration’s website.](https://boi.gov.in/)

U.S. citizens seeking to enter India as a tourist for longer than 60 days or for any other purpose must apply for a visa from an Indian embassy or consulate. The Government of India has appointed VFS Global to assist with visa services for individuals in the United States. Applicants may apply for Indian visas through the [application link](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/usa/en/ind/apply-visa). Please exercise caution and check the correct website and as there are many fake webpages that will gather your personal information.

You can submit Diplomatic and Official visa applications directly to the Indian Embassy and Consulates. All U.S. government employees traveling on official orders, including military personnel, must get country clearance for travel to India. Once you have received your visa, check it carefully to ensure that the type of visa, validity dates, and number of entries is appropriate for your travel plans.

Keep copies of your U.S. passport data page, as well as the pages containing the Indian visa and Indian immigration stamps, with you at all times. Consider saving these documents to your mobile phone in case of emergency. If your passport is lost or stolen, copies will help you apply for a replacement passport and an exit permit from the Indian government. Replacing a lost visa, which is required to exit the country, may take several business days.

U.S. citizens of Pakistani origin or descent are subject to administrative processing and should expect additional delays when applying for Indian visas.

Foreign citizens who visit India to **study, do research, work, or act as missionaries, as well as all travelers and residents planning to stay more than 180 days, are required to register their visit or residency within 14 days of arrival with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)** closest to where they will be staying, in addition**to having the appropriate visa**when they enter India. Similarly, if you are traveling to India to give birth, you must register your newborn’s birth within 14 days with the FRRO office. **Failure to do so will result in fines, fees, and penalties.** The FRRO has offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru (Bangalore), Lucknow, Calicut, Goa, Cochin, Trivandrum, and Amritsar. District Superintendents of Police serve as Foreigners Registration Officers (FROs) in all other places. We recommend all U.S. citizens review the entry requirements described on the[Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)](https://boi.gov.in/boi/public/pages/0bb32c40-0d9c-45c4-93a8-33d8b064d65d) section on the Indian Bureau of Immigration website.

If you overstay your Indian visa or break Indian visa rules, you may need clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs to leave. In general, authorities will fine you and, in some cases, may even jail you for months. Visa violators seeking an exit permit must visit [the Foreigners Regional Registration Office portal](https://indianfrro.gov.in/eservices/home.jsp) to submit the application and pay any levied fines. Processing an exit permit can take up to 90 days in these cases. Decisions will be made case by case.
