For emergency services in India, dial 112 from a cell phone; from a land line, dial 100 for police, 102 for ambulance (108 in parts of South India), and 101 for fire.

Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, and traffic does not yield to emergency vehicles. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Most hospitals require advance payment or confirmation of insurance prior to treatment. Payment practices vary, and credit cards are not routinely accepted for medical care.

Zika, dengue, malaria, measles, and other diseases are present in India. See the [Center for Disease Control’s website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/india?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) for more information.

The quality of medical care in India varies considerably. Medical care in the major population centers approaches and occasionally meets Western standards, but adequate medical care is usually very limited or unavailable in rural areas.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

Make sure your health insurance covers care overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867)to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of India to ensure the medication is legal in India. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Pharmaceuticals**

Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with limited controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. When buying medication, consult with a medical professional and purchase from reputable establishments. Please visit the [U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention website on counterfeit drugs](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/counterfeit-medicine) for more information.

**Water Quality**

Water is a common vehicle for the transmission of disease. Impure drinking water can transmit serious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and dysentery. You can make water safe for drinking by filtering/boiling, distilling, or using chemicals. Bottled water is generally safe for consumption. It is best to stick to the major brands. The water bottle seal or cap should be intact.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/india?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001)

If you are arriving in India from Sub-Saharan Africa or other areas with yellow-fever risk, Indian health regulations require that you present evidence of vaccination against yellow fever. If you lack such proof, authorities may immediately deport you or detain you in the yellow-fever quarantine center for six days. If you travel through any part of sub-Saharan Africa, even for one day, health authorities advise you to carry proof of yellow fever immunization.

Dogs and bats create a high risk of rabies transmission in most of India. Health authorities recommend vaccination for all prolonged stays, especially for young children and travelers in rural areas. It is also recommended for shorter stays that involve occupational exposure, locations more than 24 hours from a reliable source of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine for post-exposure treatment, adventure travelers, hikers, cave explorers, and backpackers. Monkeys also can transmit rabies and herpes B, among other diseases, to human victims. Avoid feeding monkeys. If bitten, you should immediately soak and scrub the bite for at least 15 minutes and seek urgent medical attention.

Influenza transmission occurs from November to April in areas north of the Tropic of Cancer (north India) and from June through November (the rainy season) in areas south of the Tropic of Cancer (south India), with a smaller peak from February through April; off-season transmission can also occur. All travelers are at risk. During the flu season, health authorities recommend that all travelers get the influenza vaccine.

Outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1 virus) occur intermittently in eastern India, including West Bengal, Manipur, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Assam.

Malaria risk depends on time of year and area the traveler is visiting. Please consult the [CDC website for India](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/yellow-fever-vaccine-malaria-prevention-by-country/india#seldyfm1118) for more information. Dengue fever presents significant risk in urban and rural areas. Health officials report the highest number of cases from July to December, with cases peaking from September to October. The CDC recommends taking daytime insect precautions, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and mosquito repellent.

Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in India. Please visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/general/tbtravelinfo.htm) [or more information.](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/general/tbtravelinfo.htm)

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in India, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. The air quality in India varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. Anyone who travels where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in India.

Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain as it is not common in Asia.

**Medical Tourism**

Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Companies offering vacation packages bundled with medical consultations and financing options provide direct-to-consumer advertising over the internet. Such medical packages often claim to provide high quality care, but the quality of health care in India is highly variable. People seeking health care in India should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.

Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and [refer to the information from the CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism). Persons traveling to India for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Please check with the nearest Indian embassy or consulate for more information.

Despite reports of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals, in general travelers should not delay or avoid treatment for urgent or emergent medical situations. However, health tourists and other travelers who may be contemplating elective procedures in this country should carefully research individual hospital infection control practices.

**Surrogacy**

Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in India, subject to complex local regulation. For additional information, [visit the Government of India’s official information on foreigner surrogacy](http://www.mea.gov.in/surrogacy-matters.htm).

The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in India maintain lists of local doctors and hospitals, all of which are published on their respective websites under "U.S. Citizen Services." We cannot endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.
