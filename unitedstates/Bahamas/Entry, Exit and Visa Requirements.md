# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Bahamas Immigration](https://www.bahamas.gov.bs/immigration) website for the most current visa information. U.S. citizens are generally required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to The Bahamas, as well as proof of anticipated departure from The Bahamas. Those traveling to The Bahamas on a cruise may use another [Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative)(WHTI) compliant document, such as a U.S. passport card. However, we strongly recommend you obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires you to disembark and return by air. U.S. travelers coming for tourism will not need a visa for travel up to 90 days. All other travelers will need a visa and/or work permit.

The Bahamas requires compliance with regulations to divert child abduction similar to [U.S. policies](https://help.cbp.gov/s/login/?language=en_US&startURL=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.cbp.gov%2Fapp%2Fanswers%2Fdetail%2Fa_id%2F827%2Fkw%2Fdivert%2520child%2520abduction&ec=302&inst=t). Review those policies before traveling.

HIV/AIDS restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of The Bahamas.
