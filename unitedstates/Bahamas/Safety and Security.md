# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Violent crime—like armed robberies, burglaries, and sexual assaults—can occur anywhere in The Bahamas.

Most crime occurs in Nassau and Freeport on New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. Stay alert in the "Over the Hill" area in Nassau, south of Shirley Street, where gangs have killed residents.

Stay alert in vacation rental properties, especially where private security is not present.

**Adventure Tourism:**Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Reconsider going on the water in rough seas or inclement weather, as accidents and fatalities have occurred in such conditions. U.S. citizens seeking to engage in adventure tourism-related activities, including boat tours, are strongly encouraged to confirm the following with any tour operator:

* Credentials and certification to operate in The Bahamas
* Liability in the event of an accident
* Safety and rescue protocols for guides

**Jet skis and boating:**

* Boating is not well regulated. Injuries and deaths have occurred.
* Sexual assaults by jet ski operators have also been reported.
* Due to the risks, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using jet skis and personal watercraft rented from independent operators on New Providence and Paradise islands.
* Watercraft may not be safe, and some operators are not licensed or insured.
* Watercraft operators sometimes ignore weather forecasts. Always follow local weather and marine alerts.

**Beach safety:**

* Boating is not well regulated. Injuries and deaths have occurred.
* Sexual assaults by jet ski operators have also been reported.
* Due to the risks, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using jet skis and personal watercraft rented from independent operators on New Providence and Paradise islands.

* Watercraft operators sometimes ignore weather forecasts. Always follow local weather and marine alerts.

**Hurricanes:**Hurricane season generally runs from June through November, although hurricanes can occur outside that period. Monitor local weather reports closely. Airports and seaports cease operations well before a predicted storm arrives, and seats on most commercial transportation may sell out far in advance.

For more information on hurricane preparedness, please refer to the Department of State’s page on[Crisis Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) and the U.S. Embassy Nassau’s [Hurricane Preparedness](https://bs.usembassy.gov/hurricane-preparedness/) page.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
