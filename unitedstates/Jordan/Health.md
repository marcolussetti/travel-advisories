Modern medical care and medicines are generally available in Jordan’s main cities but not always in outlying areas. Most acute and chronic medical conditions can be treated. When called, ambulances are often slow to arrive and personnel generally have only a basic level of training. Most hospitals in Jordan, especially in Amman, are privately owned. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment or a high deposit for services.

Seasonal dust storms that envelop the country for days or weeks each spring may significantly aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma or sinus problems.

For emergency services in Jordan, dial **911**.

Ambulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [doctors and hospitals](https://jo.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health Facilities in General**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Amman but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling.

* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Fmedicaltourism%2Findex.html) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Jordan.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Jordan.
* Persons traveling to Jordan for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* Surrogacy is illegal in Jordan.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
* The U.S. Embassy in Amman advises U.S. government employees to only drink bottled water due to confirmed levels of Radium226 and Radium228 that exceed U.S. standards for drinking water (greater than 5 picocuries per liter). U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same precaution.

**Air Quality**

* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the spring. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Jordan.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
