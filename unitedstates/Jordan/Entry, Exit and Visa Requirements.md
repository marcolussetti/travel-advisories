# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

A passport with a validity of at least six months and a visa are required for entry into Jordan. Jordanian immigration officials issue 30-day entry visas for a fee upon arrival at Amman’s Queen Alia International Airport, the northern Sheikh Hussein crossing at the Israeli border, the Eilat/Wadi Araba crossing near Aqaba and most other border crossings except the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge. U.S. citizens can also apply for a [Visa E Application through the Ministry of Interior](https://moi.gov.jo/EN/Pages/Visa_E_Applications).

**Costs:**

* 3 months / 1 entry = 40 JOD
* 3 months / 2 entries = 60 JOD
* 6 months / multiple entries = 120 JOD
* 1 year / multiple entries = 200 JOD
* 5 year / multiple entries = 110 JOD (available only to U.S. citizens)
* The Jordan Tourism Board also offers a single-fee package called “[The Jordan Pass](https://jordanpass.jo/)” that includes visa costs and entry fees to most tourist sites in Jordan. Tourists must purchase the Jordan Pass in advance [here](https://jordanpass.jo/).
* Contact the [Embassy of Jordan in Washington, D.C](http://www.jordanembassyus.org/). for current visa information.

**Visa Validity:**

* Visas upon arrival for U.S. citizens are typically valid for a 30-day stay. U.S. citizens with a five year multiple-entry visa are permitted a 90 day stay upon arrival, subject to renewal for up to 90 more days after registering with the nearest police station before the expiration of the time limit granted on their U.S. passports.
* Foreigners who wish to stay longer than the time limit given to them by Jordanian immigration officials upon entry must register at a Jordanian police station before expiration of that time limit. Travelers are generally given a single extension of 60 days.

**Fines:**

* Travelers who fail to properly register themselves incur a fine of 1.5 JOD (approximately 2 USD) per day beyond their permitted length of stay.
* This fine is usually assessed at departure.
* Travelers are barred from leaving until the fine is paid.

**King Hussein/Allenby Bridge:**

* Visas are not issued upon arrival at the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge land border crossing.
* U.S. citizens, other than diplomatic or official passport holders, must have a valid Jordanian visa or have a special entry permit from the Jordanian Ministry of Interior to enter Jordan at this crossing.
* U.S. citizens who enter Jordan on a single or multiple entry visa and depart Jordan via the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge may return to Jordan through this crossing without a new visa as long as the visa has not expired.
* An exit fee of 10 JOD (approximately 14 USD) is assessed to all visitors departing through the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge, except for diplomats residing in Jordan.

HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Jordan. Travelers may be denied entry at ports of entry, including land border crossings, if they are known to have HIV/AIDS. This policy, however, is rarely enforced and Jordanian authorities do not screen for HIV/AIDS at the border. Jordan does not permit residency for foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS. Travelers seeking to extend their stay beyond the initial timeframe are legally required to have an HIV/AIDS test performed at a government medical facility as part of a general medical screening. Those who fail to submit to the test or who test positive for HIV are denied residency and may be deported. For further information, please see the [Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan](http://www.jordanembassyus.org/) website before you travel.
