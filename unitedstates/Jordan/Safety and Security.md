# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) and al-Qa’ida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and foreign interests, and “soft” targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. While Jordan itself is relatively stable, due to high tensions in the region the security environment remains complex and can change quickly.

* Travelers to Jordan should be aware that violent extremist groups have carried out terrorist activities against U.S. and Government of Jordan targets in Jordan.
* Jordanian security services have conducted multiple operations to disrupt terrorist plots and operations.
* U.S. government personnel must have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, due to Jordanian military activity, known smuggling routes, and a lack of emergency facilities.
* U.S. government employees are not permitted to visit most border areas or any refugee camps on personal travel, and the Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid both locations.
* On occasion, the U.S. Embassy temporarily makes other areas within Jordan off limits to its staff based on the security situation. This information will be shared with the U.S. citizen community through our website and through a message to Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) enrollees.

In general, terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by foreign nationals, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, liquor stores, shopping malls, transportation hubs, places of worship, expatriate residential areas, and schools. In light of these security concerns, U.S. citizens should maintain a high level of vigilance:

* be aware of your surroundings
* take appropriate steps to increase your security awareness
* be unpredictable in your movements by varying your times and routes
* maintain a low profile
* avoid contact with any suspicious or unfamiliar objects and immediately report the presence of such objects to local authorities

U.S. government personnel overseas have been advised to take the same precautions.

**Crime:** Statistically, petty crime is the most common form of crime that U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals experience in Jordan, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Pickpockets, purse snatchers, and opportunistic thieves are known to target foreign nationals in the narrow and crowded streets of the older parts of Amman’s city center. Travelers should be alert in these areas and in all tourist locations in Jordan. Jordanian police have warned the public to exercise vigilance when leaving banks or ATMs, to reduce likelihood of targeting by thieves.

Thefts of vehicles, assaults, robbery, and attempted residential break-ins have also been reported. Take care not to display valuables in your car or on your person and be sure to lock car doors and windows.

Violent crime does occur, but U.S. citizens or other foreign nationals are rarely targeted. In the past, the Embassy has received reports of firearms being discharged at vehicles being driven by foreign nationals. Celebratory gunfire is common, especially during major festivals, sporting events, or the biannual release of high school test scores.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection [website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and U.S. Department of Justice [website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

In general, demonstrations in Jordan remain peaceful. However, some have turned violent, even when intended to be peaceful, leading security officials to intervene. Travelers should avoid all protests and large gatherings of people. Many demonstrations occur on Thursday evenings near government buildings and on Fridays near mosques following mid-day prayers. You should exercise special sensitivity and caution when visiting or traveling near mosques and religious sites during holy days and Fridays. Demonstrations and other forms of unrest have occurred on public university campuses in Jordan. Some acts of violence on university campuses have involved the use of firearms. Although generally peaceful, anti-U.S. demonstrations have also taken place in front of the U.S. Embassy.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 911. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact 911 and ask to be put in touch with the Family Protection Directorate, part of the national police, which is staffed 24/7 and has some English-speaking personnel. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of crime may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at (6) 590-6950.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion
* Provide a list of local attorneys
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call 911 and ask to speak to the Family Protection Directorate which is tasked with assisting and investigating issues of domestic violence.U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Flash Flooding:**Certain areas of Jordan, including Petra, the Dead Sea, and other tourist areas, are prone to heavy rain and flash flooding, especially from October-March. Roads and bridges may become impassable, and the Jordanian government may close tourist areas completely. The first rains of the season in particular often cause flooding throughout Amman and other cities in Jordan. It is important to watch the weather reports and heed local recommendations. The Jordanian government may send out Arabic language text messages to all cell phones registered in Jordan when inclement weather, such as heavy rain, occurs.

**Tribal Violence:**Clashes between feuding tribes, clans, or families periodically erupt without notice and sometimes involve violence, including the use of firearms. In some cases, Jordanian security services are slow to respond or may opt to let the violence subside before intervening.

**Syria and Iraq Borders:**U.S. citizens should avoid the border areas with Syria and Iraq. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km of the Jordan-Syria border, except the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, or for official visits to refugee camps anywhere in Jordan. Personal travel by U.S. government employees to the border areas and refugee camps is not permitted. Police and security officials have arrested weapon and drug smugglers, as well as foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria to fight in the country’s ongoing conflict. In the past, fighting in Syria has occurred close to Syria’s border with Jordan, and some munitions have landed within Jordan’s borders. The Department of State warns against all travel into Syria and Iraq. Please see the [Travel Advisories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/) and [Country Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel.html) for Syria and Iraq for further information.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
