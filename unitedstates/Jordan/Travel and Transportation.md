**Road Conditions and Safety:**While in Jordan, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions and driving habits that differ significantly from those in the United States.The information below concerning Jordan is provided for general reference only and may not be completely accurate in a particular location or circumstance.

U.S. Embassy Amman has advised its employees to avoid driving at night outside the Amman metropolitan area due to road conditions, poorly lighted rural roads, livestock crossings, and erratic behavior by other drivers.

It is typical for drivers in Jordan not to signal for turns or lane changes. Drivers tend to be aggressive and inattentive to surroundings, and cars operate very closely together on highways. Jordanian roads are particularly treacherous during the rainy season, which runs from October to March. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter months (December to February), making many roads – even major highways – impassable for several days. Driving in Amman also is hazardous in the summer months of June to September when Jordan experiences an influx of visitors from other countries in the region. Highway traffic is heavy around the Muslim holidays when many Jordanian expatriates return to Jordan for family visits.

The Desert Highway outside Aqaba, the Dead Sea Highway from Amman, and the King’s Highway between Petra and Madaba, all popular tourist routes, are dangerous because they are narrow, winding, steep, and crowded with trucks. Try to avoid using these roads at night. When driving in both urban and rural areas, motorists should beware of unmarked speed bumps and livestock, including camels, sheep, and goats. Collisions with livestock are common.

Muwaqqar road (also known as Highway 40) which runs from the Desert Highway east to Al-Azraq city is dangerous due to poor road conditions, poor shoulders, and a high volume of heavy truck traffic. This road is the scene of frequent vehicular accidents, including fatal collisions. This road leads to several popular tourist sites, the “Desert Castles,” but motorists should use this road with caution.

As a result of these factors, traffic accidents are frequent and continue to be the largest cause of unnatural death in Jordan.

There have been reported attacks on various tourist buses on the highway between Amman and Aqaba, known as the Desert Highway, due to ongoing business or tribal disputes. Attackers, who are believed to be private citizens, throw objects often resulting in broken windshields and interrupted trips.

Licensed drivers must carry local third-party insurance with sufficient coverage for accidents resulting in injury or death. Drivers who are involved in an accident should remain at the scene and immediately call the police and emergency personnel in case injuries have occurred. Police frequently hold the driver’s license or passport in order to prevent the driver from fleeing. Identification documents can be recovered at the police station. It is common for foreign drivers to be blamed for accidents, regardless of the actual circumstances of the incident. Following an accident, the other party may file criminal or civil charges to seek damages. U.S. citizen drivers have occasionally been detained by police as a result. The U.S. Embassy recommends that U.S. citizen drivers in a traffic accident retain [private legal counsel](https://jo.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/attorneys/).

**Traffic Laws:**Drivers must have a valid Jordanian license or a valid foreign license with an International Driving Permit to drive in Jordan. U.S. visitors who intend to drive should obtain an International Driving Permit before travel to Jordan. Temporary visitors may use their valid American driver's licenses only to rent “green” plated rental cars.

* Drivers and passengers are required to wear seatbelts.
* All cars must have a fire extinguisher and warning triangle in the vehicle.
* Child car seats are not required by law.
* Fines for speeding can exceed 140 USD. Speed cameras are installed on many roads in Jordan.
* Talking on a cell phone while driving is prohibited. If stopped by police, drivers may face a fine.

Police may pull over speeding drivers, as well as those believed to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

**Public Transportation:** Jordan has abundant taxi and ride-share services. Please see the Crime section for more information on sexual harassment and assault involving taxi drivers, as well as safety tips when using public or private transportation. Visitors should make arrangements for taxis via their hotel and request that drivers not pick up additional passengers en route to their destinations. On-call taxi services, such as Uber and Careem, also operate in Jordan. Licensed on-call taxi drivers will have government-issued license sticker on the upper corner of the vehicle windshield on the passenger seat side. Some on-call taxi drivers operate without a license and are subject to possible traffic violations. Mass transportation options, are not recommended and U.S. personnel at Embassy Amman are not authorized to use public buses due to security and safety concerns. Jordanian security authorities often establish checkpoints, especially on roads leading to popular tourist destinations, where drivers are expected to stop and present their identity documents. All drivers should stop when directed to do so and comply with the instructions provided to them by the authorities.

Emergencies should be referred to the Civil Defense Department by dialing 911.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Jordan’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Jordan’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

Due to ongoing military activity throughout Syria, the FAA has issued guidance prohibiting U.S. air carriers from flight operations in Syrian airspace, and cautioning those carriers concerning operations in neighboring airspaces.
