# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Nonexistent, hidden, and poorly maintained street signs are a major road hazard on the BES islands. Proceed through intersections with caution. Roads can be extremely slippery during rainfall.  Night driving is reasonably safe if you are familiar with the route and road conditions. Many streets are poorly lit or not lit at all. In Bonaire and St. Eustatius, be vigilant for wild donkeys or other animals crossing the road. Use caution when driving in Saba as roads tend to be steep and have many sharp turns.

The emergency service telephone number is 911. Police and ambulances tend to respond quickly to emergency situations.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving on the BES islands is on the right hand side. Right turns on red are prohibited and traffic conditions require somewhat defensive driving. Local laws require drivers and passengers to wear seat belts and motorcyclists to wear helmets. Children under 4 years of age must be in child safety seats, and children under 12 must ride in the back seat.

**Public Transportation:** Taxis are an easy form of transportation on the islands. Verify the price before entering the taxi, as there are no meters. Fares are quoted in U.S. dollars. In Bonaire, public minibuses are inexpensive and run nonstop during the day with no fixed schedule. Each minibus has a specific route displayed on the windshield. Buses, which run on the hour, have limited routes. The road conditions on the main thoroughfares are good to fair. There is no public transportation in Saba or St. Eustatius.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of the BES Islands’ Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of BES Islands’ air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
