# Safety and Security

**Crime:** Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius are all assessed as low-crime areas as their small populations provide a high level of social control and their police forces are professional and responsive. Thoe crimes that do occur are generally non-violent, financially-motivated, and opportunistic in nature such as pickpocketing, thefts of unattended bags, and smash and grabs of empty vehicles. Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas or in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Keep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case it is stolen.  
  
Car theft, especially of rental vehicles, can occur. Vehicle leases or rentals may not be fully covered by local insurance when a vehicle is stolen or damaged. Be sure you are sufficiently insured when renting vehicles and jet skis.

The legal drinking age of 18 is not always rigorously enforced on the BES islands, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate. Travel in pairs or groups and be responsible with alcohol consumption.

**Victims of Crime:**Dial 911 for police assistance in the BES Islands. Contact the U.S. Consulate at (+599)(9)-461-3066 after you have contacted local police. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Do not rely on hotels, restaurants, or tour companies to make the police report for you.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Consulate for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
