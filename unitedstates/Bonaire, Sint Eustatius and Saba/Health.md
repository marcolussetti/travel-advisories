Access to quality medical care is limited on the BES Islands, and facilities do not offer the health and service standards typically expected in the United States*.*

For emergency services in the BES Islands, **dial 911**.

Ambulance services are widely available.

A [list of medical facilities](https://cw.usconsulate.gov/medical-assistance/) in the BES Islands is available on our Consulate website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medicines:** Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of the Netherlandsto ensure the medication is legal in the BES islands. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Drug stores or “boticas” provide prescription and over-the-counter medicine. Visitors need a local prescription, and may not be able to find medications normally available in the U.S. Emergency services are usually quick to respond.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.
