**For police service in Japan, dial 110. For fire or ambulance, dial 119.**

**Ambulance services are widely available but receiving hospitals may decline to accept inbound patients unless they can provide proof of funds to pay for services.**

**COVID-19 Testing:**

* Travelers should contact Japanese local health providers to determine the location of testing facilities within Japan. A non-comprehensive list of some COVID-19 testing facilities can be found here on the [Embassy website.](https://jp.usembassy.gov/services/pcr-testing-facilities-in-japan/)

**COVID-19 Vaccines:**

* The COVID-19 vaccine isavailable for U.S. citizens to receive in Japan.
* Review the Government of Japan’s [English language website](https://japan.kantei.go.jp/ongoingtopics/vaccine.html) on COVID-19 vaccinations in Japan.
* Visit the FDA's website to [learn more about FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Some care providers in Japan only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [Japan’s Ministry of Health website](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Japan; possession, use, or importation of a prescription drug that is illegal in Japan may result in arrest and criminal prosecution. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. U.S. prescriptions are not honored in Japan, so if you need ongoing prescription medicine, you should arrive with a sufficient supply for your stay in Japan or enough until you are able to see a local care provider.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Japan has a national health insurance system which is available only to those foreigners with long-term visas for Japan. National health insurance does not pay for medical evacuation. Medical caregivers in Japan may require payment in full at the time of treatment or concrete proof of ability to pay before they will treat a foreigner who is not a member of the national health insurance plan.

U.S.-style and standard psychological and psychiatric care can be difficult to locate outside of major urban centers in Japan and generally is not available outside of Japan's major cities. Extended psychiatric care can be very difficult to obtain.
