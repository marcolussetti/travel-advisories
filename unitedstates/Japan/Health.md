**Ambulance services**Ambulance services are widely available, but hospitals may refuse patients without proof of funds to pay.

**Medical payments and insurance**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.

* Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.
* Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan provides [coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on [types of insurance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) available.
* If you don’t pay your medical bill, you may be prevented from leaving Japan by Immigration.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription medications**If traveling with a prescription, check with the government of [Japan’s Ministry of Health](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html) to ensure it is legal.

* Possession, use, or import of prescription drugs banned in Japan may result in arrest and criminal prosecution.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
* U.S. prescriptions are not honored in Japan. Bring enough of your prescription medicine for your entire stay in Japan, or, until you can see a local doctor.

**Vaccinations**Stay up to date on all[vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**National health insurance**Japan’s national health insurance is only for foreigners with long-term visas.

* Medical providers may ask for payment up front. They may also ask for proof of funds before treating uninsured foreigners.
* U.S.-style psychological and psychiatric care is hard to find outside major cities.
* Extended psychiatric care is difficult to access in Japan.

**Air quality**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast). It uses AI, historical data, and global pollution models to create a 3-day air quality forecast for Japan.
