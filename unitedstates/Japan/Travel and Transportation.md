**Road conditions and safety**Driving in Japan can be complicated and expensive.

* Traffic moves on the left side of the road.
* If you don’t know Japanese, you will have trouble understanding road signs.
* Highway tolls can be very high, and city traffic is often very congested.
* There is virtually no legal roadside or curbside parking. However, traffic is commonly blocked or partially blocked by people illegally parked on the curbside.
* In mountainous areas, roads are often closed during the winter. Cars should be equipped with tire chains.
* Roads in Japan are much narrower than those in the United States.

**Traffic laws**Japanese law holds all drivers liable for accidents. It assesses faults in accidents on all parties.

* Japanese compulsory insurance (JCI) is mandatory for all car owners and drivers in Japan.
* Most short-term visitors choose not to drive in Japan.
* Turning right or left on red lights is not permitted in Japan.
* All passengers are required to wear seat belts.
* Japan has a national 0.03% blood-alcohol-level standard for driving. Drivers stopped for DUI will have their licenses confiscated.
* If you are guilty of DUI, speeding, or reckless driving that injures another person, you could face up to 15 years in prison.
* Traffic laws also apply to cyclists. You can be arrested for using a cellphone while cycling or riding under the influence of alcohol.

* You must obtain an IDP prior to arriving in Japan.
* The U.S. Embassy and U.S. consulates do not issue IDPs.
* IDPs issued via the Internet or by other organizations are not valid in Japan.
* Foreign residents in Japan who use an unacceptable IDP (such as one issued while in Japan) may be fined or arrested.
