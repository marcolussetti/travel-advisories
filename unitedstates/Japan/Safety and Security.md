[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

* **Dial 110** for police
* **Dial 119** for fire or ambulance services
* **Dial 03-3224-5000** (011-81-3-3224-5000 from overseas) for the U.S. Embassy in Japan (after contacting local authorities).
* [**Calling for Help**](https://jp.usembassy.gov/services/calling-for-help/) (source: U.S. Embassy in Japan)

When calling Japanese authorities for help, you need to be able to describe your address or location in Japanese or find someone who can do so. Few police officers speak English.

**Crime**Crime against U.S. citizens in Japan is low. It typically involves personal disputes, petty theft, or vandalism.

* Robberies can happen when someone is drugged by a spiked drink, especially in nightlife districts in major cities.
* Sexual assaults are not often reported, but they do occur. Victims may be randomly targeted. It’s hard for foreigners to access victim assistance or shelters.
* Hate-related violent crimes rarely occur. But some U.S. citizens have reported being the target of discrimination because of their nationality or their race.
* Pick pocketing can occur in crowded shopping areas, on trains, and at airports.
* Police reports must be filed before leaving Japan. Japanese police will not accept reports filed from overseas.
* If your credit card is stolen or used fraudulently, Japanese police usually give a report number instead of a full report. You can give this number to your credit card company to confirm the issue.

**Entertainment and nightlife districts in Tokyo**Exercise caution in all entertainment and nightlife districts throughout Japan, especially in:

* Roppongi
* Kabuki-cho
* Shibuya
* Ikebukuro
* Reports of incidents involving U.S. citizens at bars or clubs in these areas include physical and sexual assaults, drug overdoses, spiked drinks, and thefts (such as stolen purses, wallets, cash, and credit cards).
* Victims of spiked drinks sometimes regain consciousness in the bar or club; other victims may awaken on the street or other unfamiliar locations.
* U.S. citizens have reported being threatened with guns or knives in such venues. They are asked to pay excessive bar bills or withdraw money. U.S. citizens have also reported being beaten when they have refused to pay or hand over money.
* There have been reports of U.S. citizens being forced to take money out of ATMs or being robbed because they couldn’t pay large bar tabs.
* Roppongi, Kabuki-cho, and other entertainment and nightlife districts have also been the scenes of violence between criminal gangs.

**Victims of crime**Police reports must be filed at the nearest police station prior to departure from Japan.

* The Japanese police cannot accept reports filed from overseas.
* Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.
