**Entry and exit requirements**For tourist or business “visa free” stays up to 90 days:

* You must have a valid passport and should have proof of return or onward ticket.
* Your passport must be valid for the entire time you are staying in Japan.
* You cannot work on the local economy.
* You cannot change to another visa while in Japan (like a spouse, work, or study visa). You will need to leave and re-enter Japan with the correct visa.
* Immigration officers may deny entry if you lack proof of how you'll support yourself in Japan. They may also deny you exit from Japan if you have unpaid bills.
* All visitors must provide fingerprints and have their photo taken upon arrival. This doesn't apply to those entering on diplomatic visas, minors, or certain members of the military traveling on official orders.

For further information about landing procedures, please visit the [Immigration Bureau of Japan](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/?hl=en).

**Lost or stolen passports**

* You cannot use a passport that you’ve reported as lost or stolen, even if you find it later.
* Japanese authorities will likely deny you entry if you try.
* If your passport was lost or stolen, you need to get a new one before traveling.

Visit the [Embassy of Japan](https://jp.usembassy.gov/passports/) to see instructions on how to replace a lost or stolen passport.

**Transiting through Japan**

* Ensure that your passport and visa are valid for your entire stay. Passport services are not available at the airport.
