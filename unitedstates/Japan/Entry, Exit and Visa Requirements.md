[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Japan](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itprtop_en/index.html) website for the most current visa information.

There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

**Entry & Exit:**

* You must have a valid passport and an onward/return ticket for tourist/business "visa free" stays of up to 90 days. Your passport must be valid for the entire time you are staying in Japan.
* You cannot work on a 90-day "visa free" entry.
* "Visa free" entry status may not be changed to another visa status without departing and then re-entering Japan with the appropriate visa, such as a spouse, work, or study visa.
* Visit the [Embassy of Japan website](https://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itprtop_en/index.html) for the most current information on all visa categories.
* Japanese immigration officers may deny you entry if you appear to have no visible means of support.
* All foreign nationals are required to provide fingerprint scans and to be photographed at the port of entry. Exceptions to this requirement include diplomatic and official visa holders, minors, and individuals covered under SOFA Article IX.2. For further information about landing procedures, please visit the [Immigration Bureau of Japan’s website](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/index.html).
* Make sure your passport is valid. Note you cannot travel on a passport you have previously declared as lost or stolen even if you subsequently locate it. Japanese authorities will likely deny you entry into Japan if you attempt to do so. If you have reported your passport lost or stolen, you must apply for a new passport before travel.

**Transiting Japan:**

* Ensure that your passport and visa are valid and up-to-date before you leave the United States. Passport services are not available at the airport.
* Airlines in Japan may deny you boarding for transit if you do not have the required travel documents for an onward destination in another country or if your passport does not have six months of validity remaining. For the entry requirements of the country you are traveling to, visit the [State Department's Country Specific Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html) website.

**Military/SOFA Travelers:** While active-duty U.S. military personnel may enter Japan under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with proper Department of Defense (DoD) identification and travel orders, all SOFA family members, civilian employees, and contractors must have valid passports to enter Japan. Please consult the [DOD Foreign Clearance Guide](https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm) before leaving the United States.

See [the Immigration Bureau of Japan’s website](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/index.html) for various immigration procedures.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Japan.
