Please visit the Embassy's [COVID-19 page](https://er.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/) for more information on COVID-19 in Eritrea.

Consult the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for Eritrea](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/eritrea) prior to travel.

Medical facilities and physicians are limited. Medicines are in short supply. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Bring preventative and over-the counter medicines with you.

For emergency services in Eritrea, dial + (291) 1-202-914 / 201-917 / 201-606.

Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available. Ambulances have minimal equipment; training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the closest [Embassy of the State of Eritrea](https://us.embassyeritrea.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Eritrea.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the CDC.
