See the [Department of State Travel Advisory for Eritrea](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/eritrea-travel-advisory.html)**.**

Eritrea experiences frequent water shortages and not all hotels have running water. Fuel shortages occur as well.

**Travel Permits:** All foreign nationals, including U.S. Embassy officials, are required to obtain permits for travel more than 25 km outside of Asmara. Applications for travel permits are available at the two Ministry of Tourism offices located on Harnet Avenue and Airport Road. If you encounter difficulties while outside of the Asmara area, the Embassy’s ability to provide consular services may be limited.

Use caution when traveling near the Eritrea-Ethiopia border area. Remain on major roads in the border region due to unmarked minefields. The Eritrea-Ethiopia border is closed; there is no legal means to travel between Ethiopia and Eritrea by land.

Foreign nationals generally are not permitted to approach or cross the Djibouti-Eritrea land border.

There are landmines, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25-mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.

Certain remote Eritrean islands have military facilities and are not accessible to tourists.

**Crime:** The Embassy is unable to quantify actual rates of crime as Eritrea does not publicly provide crime statistics, but crimes do occur and police have limited capacity to investigate. While most reported criminal incidents in Asmara involve crimes of opportunity, car and home burglaries and sexual assaults are also reported. U.S. citizens are encouraged to implement personal security practices such as:

* Avoid walking alone, especially at night.
* Do not display cash and valuable personal property.
* Maintain a low profile. Avoid doing anything that draws attention to you or your family.
* Remain alert to what is going on around you.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible. Report crimes to the local police at + (291)-1-127-799 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (291) 1-120-004.

In Asmara and throughout Eritrea, in an emergency, dial

* + (291) 1-127-799 for the police
* + (291) 1-202-099 for the fire department
* + (291) 1-202-914 / 201-917 / 201-606 (Orotta Hospital) for medical emergencies
* + (291) 1 – 185-400 (Halibet Hospital) for medical emergencies

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** Tourism industry infrastructure is minimal. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response capabilities are limited, and subsequent appropriate medical treatment may not be available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
