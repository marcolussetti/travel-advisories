**Requirements for Entry:**

* Visa: Obtain your visa before traveling. Visit the [Embassy of the State of Eritrea in Washington, D.C.](https://embassyeritrea.org/) website for the most current visa information. Overseas inquiries should be made at the nearest Eritrean Embassy or Consulate.
* Vaccination certificate: For travelers 9 months and older coming from [countries with risk of Yellow Fever](https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/index.html).

**Electronic items:** Strict restrictions are in place for the type and quantity of electronics allowed into the country. Check with the [Embassy of the State of Eritrea in Washington, D.C.](https://embassyeritrea.org/) for the most current regulations. All electronics (e.g. laptops, mobile phones, cameras) must be declared upon arrival. Customs officials may confiscate previously undeclared items when you depart. Non-residents may need to show that they are leaving Eritrea with the declared electronics in their possession.
