# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** Visitors are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**U.S.-Eritrean Dual Nationals:** Eritrea does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-Eritrean citizens are considered Eritrean nationals by the Eritrean authorities. This limits our ability to provide consular services for dual nationals.

Dual nationals may be subject to certain obligations, including taxes and conscription into national service. Proof of payment of the two-percent income tax is required to obtain any civil documents (e.g., birth certificates, educational transcripts, property ownership records, court records). Ask about your status at an Eritrean embassy or consulate regarding before you travel.

**Military Service for Dual U.S.–Eritrean Nationals:** The National Service Proclamation of October 1995 states that any national between the age of 18 and 50 must participate in National Service.

**Photography:** Exercise caution when taking photographs in Eritrea. Individuals taking photos of military or government installations may face a warning, harassment, confiscation of the phone/camera, arrest, detention, or interrogation. Do not take photos of Eritreans without their permission.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Eritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals in detention. The U.S. Embassy may not receive notification or be allowed access to you if you are detained. You may ask your family members to contact the Embassy on your behalf. See our [webpage](https://er.usembassy.gov/) for further information.

**Phone Service:** Cellular phones are common. Landlines are available in most homes and are more reliable than cellular service. It is very difficult for a tourist to obtain a SIM card for cellular service. There is no data service or roaming available.

**Currency:** The Eritrean Nakfa (ERN) is the official currency. The economy is cash-based and there are no ATMs. **Credit cards are not accepted anywhere in Eritrea**. It is illegal to use foreign currency to make purchases except at a few official hotels and stores where foreigners are required to pay in U.S. dollars or Euros. For businesses that will accept U.S. dollars, they require bills printed from 2003 or later.

It is illegal to exchange money anywhere other than at a state foreign currency exchange Himbol branch. You must declare all foreign currency brought into Eritrea in excess of $10,000 (or the equivalent) and on departure you must prove that any missing foreign currency was exchanged at a branch of the Himbol or provide receipts for the items you purchased.

The Eritrean government prohibits travelers from taking more than 1,000 Nakfa out of Eritrea. Violators may have the money confiscated and/or be detained.

If you are transiting from Addis Ababa, be aware there is a limit of $3,000 (or foreign currency equivalent) that may be carried out of Ethiopia. See the [Ethiopia country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ethiopia.html) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual activity is punishable by incarceration of ten days to three years. Antidiscrimination laws relating to LGB persons do not exist. There are no known LGB organizations in the country. Hotels do not allow two females or two males to share one room unless it has separate beds.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. Within Asmara, sidewalks are plentiful, although most are in bad condition and do not have cutouts. Few buildings have elevators. Due to frequent power outages, these elevators may not be functioning.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:** Domestic violence, punishable as assault and battery, is commonplace but rarely reported and perpetrators are not prosecuted. No information is available on the prevalence of rape.

**Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C):** While FGM/C is a traditional practice in many parts of the country, the government has prioritized the elimination of the practice. While it is still practiced in some areas, many regions have completely eliminated the practice.
