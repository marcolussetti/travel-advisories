# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Stay on main roads. Rural roads and off-road driving can be dangerous. Traveling by road is also hazardous due to slow motorized carts, pedestrians, bicycles, livestock, fog, poor road maintenance, and poor lighting. There are minefields in certain areas of the country. The roads between Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Barentu, and Keren are paved, but roads to small villages are not. Mountain roads, which are narrow and winding with crumbling edges, generally do not have guardrails or signs, and sometimes have poor visibility of oncoming traffic around hairpin turns. Road debris is common during the rainy seasons, which differ depending on which part of the country you are in. The Filfil Road from Asmara to Massawa has a large amount of mountain debris and has washed away in parts. Wild baboons may be sighted on mountain roads. They are not safe to approach; keep vehicle windows closed and doors closed.

**Traffic Laws:** If you wish to drive in Eritrea, you must obtain an Eritrea driver’s license. You may not use your U.S. or international driver’s license. The police may stop drivers randomly to inspect driver’s licenses.

**Accidents:** If you are involved in an automobile accident, you should contact the local police immediately. Leave your car in place until the local police arrive to take a report. Local garages will be unable to make repairs without a police certificate, even for single vehicle accidents. If a crowd forms and becomes hostile, contact the U.S. Embassy.

**Public Transportation:** Buses and taxis, both of which run on pre-established routes, are inexpensive.

* Buses: Extreme over-crowding makes them unsafe, and pickpocketing is common.
* Taxis: Requests for any deviation from the route can result in significantly higher fares. You may ask a driver in advance not to take other passengers if you pay a higher fare.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety and Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Eritrea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Eritrea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Eritrea should first contact the [Embassy of the State of Eritrea](https://us.embassyeritrea.org/) in Washington, D.C., to ensure they have permission to enter Eritrean waters. Mariners should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
