# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit [Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina](http://www.bhembassy.org/) for the most current visa information.

Your passport should be valid for at least three months past your planned date of departure.

**Bosnia and Herzegovina will deny entry to U.S. passport holders who attempt to enter on expired U.S. passports or U.S. passports which were previously reported as lost or stolen.**

U.S. citizens do not need a visa for stays of up to 90 days total within a period of six months from the date of first entry. After your 90-day stay, you must wait an additional 90 days before applying to re-enter Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Airlines may deny boarding to travelers on a one-way ticket or a ticket with a return date beyond three months from the date of arrival. Verify with the airline before travel.

If staying in a private residence for three or more days, you or your host must register your stay with the local police or field office of the Department for Foreigners within 48 hours of arrival.

**Temporary Residence Permits:**

U.S. citizens staying more than 90 days must apply for a temporary residence permit from the local field office of the Department for Foreigners of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Security. The process is complex. Visit the [Department for Foreigners of the Ministry of Security website](https://sps.gov.ba/?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=14&lang=en) for detailed information and requirements.

Collect the required documentation well in advance. Submit the application as soon as possible, after arriving in-country. You must submit your temporary residence permit application at least 15 days prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day visa-free period of stay.

You should submit an FBI background check or a police report from your local, U.S. police department attesting you have no criminal record. The document you submit must be an original with the signature and seal of the U.S. official and certified by an [apostille](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/replace-certify-docs/authenticate-your-document/apostille-requirements.html). This must be issued within six months of the application.

After all application requirements are met, a months-long delay can occur before a residence permit is issued. U.S. citizens who submit complete applications may remain in the country while awaiting decisions.

The maximum duration of a temporary residence permit is 12 months (renewals are possible).

Your U.S. passport must be valid for at least three months after the end of the requested temporary residence permit period.

**Requirements for minors traveling to Bosnia and Herzegovina:**

* Notarized permission from the parents or guardians is required for minors under 14 traveling alone.
* If the child is accompanied by one parent, particularly if the parent has a different last name from the child’s, it is recommended, although not legally required, that the accompanying parent carry a notarized letter from the other parent giving permission to travel.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
