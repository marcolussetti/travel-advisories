# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**:

* Many roads are poorly maintained and are sometimes blocked because of landslides, public gatherings, and traffic accidents.
* Two-lane roads between cities are often narrow, lack guardrails, and curvy.
* Winter driving can be hazardous because of fog, snow, and ice.
* Be alert for drunk drivers, drivers traveling at excessive speeds, heavy vehicles, and agricultural equipment. Streetlights are uncommon outside of cities.
* See the Department of State’s [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

Visit the websites of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s national tourist office and the [local automobile association (in Bosnian)](https://bihamk.ba/) road safety information.

The emergency number for vehicle assistance and towing service is 1282 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 1285 in the Republika Srpska.

**Traffic Laws**:

* Seat belt use is mandatory.
* Talking on a cell phone while driving is illegal.
* The legal blood alcohol limit is .03 percent which is less than half the legal limit in the United States.
* BiH law requires a safety vest, spare tire, jack, first aid kit, safety triangle, tow rope, and spare light bulbs in the car at all times.
* You must have an international driving permit and a U.S. license to drive in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* Snow tires are required from November through April.

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation such as buses, taxis, trams, and trains operate in and between major cities. These operators should be licensed and clearly post fares.

During the winter months, flights at Sarajevo’s airport are frequently delayed or canceled due to heavy fog. Be prepared for last-minute cancellations, schedule changes, lengthy delays, alternate routings, or time-consuming overland transportation.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel**: BiH has a small port in the town of Neum. Mariners planning travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina should check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts), [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
