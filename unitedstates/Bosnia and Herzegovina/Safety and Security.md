# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets. They are using knives, firearms, rudimentary explosive devices, and vehicles to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)

* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Violent incidents**

* Local criminals use firearms and explosives to settle disputes. The majority of incidents involving improvised explosives in Sarajevo occur after dark. The foreign community is rarely targeted, but collateral damage can occur.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** The overall crime rate for the country is high, and Sarajevo has a high rate of property-related crime.

* The most common criminal activities in Sarajevo are:

              robberies, residential and vehicle break-ins, theft, and

              pickpocketing in areas frequented by tourists in Sarajevo.

* Be always alert, especially after dark and in locations frequented by tourists, such as cafés, parking garages, shopping areas, and restaurants.
* Take precautions to protect your property from theft by always maintaining positive control of your belongings. Travel in groups and stay in well-lit areas after dark.
* Avoid carrying large sums of money.
* People wearing backpacks stand out and attract the attention of pickpockets.

**Landmines:**

* Landmine explosions have injured and killed many people in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1995.
* Minefields, active landmines, and unexploded ordnances are a threat throughout the country and deaths from explosions have occurred as recently as March 2023.
* Stay on hard surfaced areas and out of abandoned buildings. Observe mine warning signs throughout the country. Consult with the latest landmine maps via the [Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html). Regardless of an area’s mine status, avoid unmarked trails.
* For more information about landmines and unexploded ordinance, please visit the website of the [Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html).

**Demonstrations** can occur anywhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international or sporting events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Large demonstrations, even if peaceful, can create traffic congestion and lead to closures of public transportation, roadways, and sidewalks.

**Soccer matches**:

* Rival supporters occasionally fight and cause property damage and physical injuries. Avoid the area. Large crowds before and after matches can create significant traffic congestion.
* Large groups of soccer fans can quickly become violent. Avoid crowds and large groups.
* Road and sidewalk closures are common.

**Feral dogs**:

* Avoid stray dogs. Packs or individual dog attacks occur in urban and rural areas and can be unpredictable.
* Though emergency medical facilities can treat dog bites and rabies vaccines are available, travelers should consider a series of pre-exposure rabies vaccinations prior to arrival.
* For further information, please consult the [CDC’s information on rabies](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/specific_groups/travelers/pre-exposure_vaccinations.html).

Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are infrequent. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified. In the event of an injury, medical treatment may only be available in/near major cities. Outside of cities, first responders may not be available to provide urgent medical treatment.
