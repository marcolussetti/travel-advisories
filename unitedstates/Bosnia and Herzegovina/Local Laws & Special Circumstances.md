[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**CRIMINAL PENALTIES**: In Bosnia and Herzegovina, you are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

**It is against the law to photograph military or secure installations, including airports, equipment, bridges, government checkpoints, troops, or embassies. If in doubt, ask permission before taking photographs.**

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, penalties are severe for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs. Courts impose long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**LGB Travelers**: There are no current legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, although elected officials in the Republika Srpska have proposed banning LGB rights activists from holding events at, visiting, or working in educational institutions. Elected officials have also said that they will not permit any LGB events in the Republika Srpska entity.

* Discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* Acts of violence and harassment targeting LGB individuals or organizations supporting LGB rights have occurred, and police were sometimes slow to respond or failed to investigate the incidents and prosecute perpetrators.
* Government officials have made derogatory comments about LGB persons and about organizations promoting human rights.
* While the laws at the state, entity, and Brcko District levels prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, authorities have not fully enforced them. Some elected officials have proposed laws to restrict the activities of LGB rights groups.
* Pride event participants have been threatened in the past and participants should expect a heavy police presence.
* Physical confrontations surrounding soccer matches have included right-wing nationalist, racist, or anti-LGB violence.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Bosnia and Herzegovina’s laws prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the law is only partially enforced, and discrimination continues.

* Accessibility is limited in urban public transportation, lodging, and communication/information and generally unavailable outside urban areas.
* There is limited availability of sign language interpreters, personal assistants, or other related services. Access to special rental, repair, or replacement equipment is very limited.
