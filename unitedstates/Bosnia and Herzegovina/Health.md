**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in most cities in BiH. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates by season. It is at its worst in the winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure are:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in BiH.
