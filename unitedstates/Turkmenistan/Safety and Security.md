# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**Crime is limited. There are few reports of violent crime in Turkmenistan. Take normal safety precautions, such as avoiding travel after dark or in deserted/unfamiliar areas.

Prostitution is illegal. The definition of a prostitute is subjective. Police are known to raid local establishments for prostitution.

Police and military are present in all regions of Turkmenistan. Security personnel maintain checkpoints on major roads and may place visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, e-mail, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.

Always carry your passport; otherwise, you may be detained. Police asking to see identity papers can be aggressive and have been known to solicit bribes. Ask for identification if you are unsure the person requesting to see your documents is an official.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to [contact the Embassy](https://tm.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/victims-of-crime/) for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response capabilities are limited, or unreliable, and urgent medical treatment can be inappropriate or not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
