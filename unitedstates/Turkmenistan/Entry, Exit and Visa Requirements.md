# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

See the[Embassy of Turkmenistan’s website](https://usa.tmembassy.gov.tm/en/consular-services/visa) for visa information.

All arriving passengers must take a COVID-19 test when they arrive at the airport. The cost of the test is $31.

Turkmenistan’s Law on Citizenship does not allow its citizens to have dual citizenship. As a result, the country often stops U.S.-Turkmen dual citizens from leaving until they give up their Turkmen citizenship. This process can take several months. The ability of the U.S. Embassy in Ashgabat to assist such dual citizens is very limited. We strongly urge all dual U.S.-Turkmen citizens to contact the Embassy for more information before traveling to Turkmenistan.

Please see the[Embassy's page on dual citizenship](https://tm.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/dual-citizenship/) for additional information.

A letter of invitation is required for entry into Turkmenistan. The person or organization inviting you must submit a request to the[State Migration Service (SMS)](https://migration.gov.tm/en/) along with a copy of your passport ID page. After receiving the letter of invitation, apply for a visa at the Embassy of Turkmenistan in Washington, D.C. or at the airport in Ashgabat upon arrival. The cost of the visa application varies depending on the length of validity. A $29 registration fee is also required upon arrival.

We cannot help private citizens obtain letters of invitation.

If you arrive without a visa or certified letter of invitation, officials may hold you at the airport. They will keep you until you arrange a way out of Turkmenistan.

**Register yourself and apply for visa extensions with the SMS in Ashgabat. You must register with SMS within 3 working days of your arrival. You must do this if you plan to stay in Turkmenistan more than 3 working days. You must also register your departure with SMS one day prior to your departure.**

Foreigners are forbidden to travel to “restricted zones” without special permission from the SMS. Restricted zones include border areas and along the Caspian coast.

Failure to register properly or to update your visa with SMS can result in fines, arrest, and/or deportation. Visit a local SMS office to learn about additional requirements.

If you are deported for these violations, authorities will bar your return to Turkmenistan for up to five years.

**HIV/AIDS Information:** Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Turkmenistan. Foreign workers may be required to undergo HIV testing for business visas. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Turkmenistan](https://usa.tmembassy.gov.tm/en) before you travel.
