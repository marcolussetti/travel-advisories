# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic accidents involving serious injury to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are common. Many city roads are hazardous because of potholes, uncovered manholes, poor lighting, and pedestrians ignoring oncoming traffic. Most roads outside of major cities are narrow, not lighted, and lacking road signs. Avoid driving at night on rural roads.

Drive defensively and use an abundance of caution. Driving practices differ from those in the United States, and can include drivers going down the wrong way on one-way streets or divided highways, sudden lane changes, left-hand turns from the right lane, etc.

There is no roadside assistance in Turkmenistan.

**Traffic Laws:** If you drive while intoxicated, you may be fined, imprisoned, and have your license revoked. You may be fined if you don’t use seat belts or if you drive while using a cell phone. Police at checkpoints (where cars are required to stop and register) may arbitrarily fine motorists.

**Driving Requirements:** You must have a valid international driving permit. Foreigners residing in Turkmenistan must apply for a local driver’s license with the Road Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Turkmenistan. For more specific information about driving in Turkmenistan, contact the Embassy of Turkmenistan at 202-588-1500.

See our[Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Public Transportation:** Most taxis are unregulated. They lack basic safety features. Always negotiate fares in advance with unregulated taxi drivers.

Avoid taking taxis after dark or sharing a taxi with other passengers. When traveling at night, hire a driver through your travel agency or hotel.

The only government-owned/government-regulated taxi company operates in Ashgabat (telephone 993-12-760501)

**Travel by Ferry:** “Ferries” crossing the Caspian Sea are cargo ships that also take on passengers as space permits. Food and water are not typically provided, and sleeping and sanitary facilities are basic. Ships arriving in Turkmenbashy may take a week to find a vacant dock.

**Airlines:** Regular international commercial flights have resumed, but demand for available seats remains high. Tickets for Turkmenistan Airlines flights may only be purchased in-person in Turkmenistan. Travelers should also note that delayed flight times are common when entering or exiting Turkmenistan.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Turkmenistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the[FAA’s safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Turkmenistan should check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts.](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts) Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the[NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) (click “Broadcast Warnings”). In general, there is very little information available about maritime travel to Turkmenistan. Caspian ferry services are considered unreliable and generally inadvisable.
