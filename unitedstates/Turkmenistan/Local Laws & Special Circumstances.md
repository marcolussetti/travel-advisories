# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Prostitution is illegal. Police are known to raid local establishments for prostitution.

If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) on crimes against minors abroad and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking pictures of anything of possible military or security interest, including government buildings and food markets.

If you stay overnight in a location other than the one where you are registered with the SMS, you may be arrested.

Local law criminalizes the knowing exposure or transmission of HIV to another person and carries a sentence of up to 5 years. The law also stipulates sentences of up to 20 years for the spread of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections through same-sex contact.

Police and military are present in all regions of Turkmenistan. Security personnel maintain checkpoints on major roads and may place visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, e-mail, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.

Always carry your passport; otherwise, you may be detained. Police asking to see identity papers can be aggressive and have been known to solicit bribes. Ask for identification if you are unsure, the person requesting to see your documents is an official.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to [notify the U.S. Embassy immediately](https://tm.usembassy.gov/services/#arrest). Review our [arrest or detention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) webpage for further information.

**Money:** Turkmenistan has a cash economy. Most businesses, including airlines and hotels, do not accept credit cards. While there are some ATMs in Ashgabat, getting personal checks cashed can take up to two months.

The official currency in Turkmenistan is the Turkmen Manat. It is illegal to use foreign currencies and to exchange money on the black market. You can obtain Manat from ATM machines.

Customs rules are strict. This is especially true for carpets, jewelry, musical instruments, art, ancient artifacts, antiques, and protected animals. Before purchasing such items for export, see the [Embassy of Turkmenistan website](https://usa.tmembassy.gov.tm/en) for their customs information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** Sexual contact between men is illegal and carries criminal penalties. The law does not mention same-sex sexual contact between women, but social norms in the country are very conservative. Enforcement of the law is often selective. Harassment, detention, and prison sentences are possible.

The Embassy cautions all travelers against displays of affection in public.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**

The law in Turkmenistan prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure throughout Turkmenistan.

Public transportation, sidewalks, many buildings, and public areas are not wheelchair accessible.
