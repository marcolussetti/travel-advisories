# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad. Also, see the[Department of Justice website.](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116)

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking pictures of anything of possible military or security interest, including government buildings and food markets.

If you stay overnight in a location other than the one where you are registered with the SMS, you may be arrested.

Local law criminalizes the knowing exposure or transmission of HIV to another person and carries a sentence of up to 5 years. The law also stipulates sentences of up to 20 years for the spread of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections through same-sex contact.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to [notify the U.S. Embassy immediately](https://tm.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/). See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Money:** Turkmenistan has a cash economy. Most businesses, including airlines and hotels, do not accept credit cards. While there are some ATMs in Ashgabat, getting personal checks cashed can take up to two months.

The official currency in Turkmenistan is the Turkmen Manat. It is illegal to use foreign currencies and to exchange money on the black market. You can obtain Manat in ATM machines.

Customs rules are strict. This is especially true for carpets, jewelry, music instruments, art, ancient artifacts, antiques, and protected animals. Before purchasing such items for export, see the [Embassy of Turkmenistan website](https://usa.tmembassy.gov.tm/en) for their customs information.

**LGB Travelers:** Sexual contact between men is illegal and carries criminal penalties. The law does not mention same-sex sexual contact between women, but social norms in the country are very conservative. Enforcement of the law is often selective. Harassment, detention, and prison sentences are possible.

The Embassy cautions all travelers against displays of affection in public.
