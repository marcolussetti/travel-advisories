For emergency services in Turkmenistan, **dial 03**. Ambulance services are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance). They have more information on the insurance you should consider before you travel abroad.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance. It covers medical evacuation.

Medical care is limited and well below U.S. standards. U.S. citizens in Turkmenistan often travel to other countries for medical treatment. This includes many routine procedures.

Basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics, are often in short supply. The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens not undergo invasive procedures in Turkmenistan. Undergoing any such procedure may place you at risk of serious illness. If you have a serious medical condition, check with your physician before planning travel to Turkmenistan.

If you have prescription medication, check with the Government of Turkmenistan. Make sure the medication is legal there. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://tm.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/turkmenistan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Water Quality:** In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and drinks are safe. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
