**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions in Austria are excellent. During the winter, roads in alpine areas may become dangerous due to snow, ice, or avalanches. Some mountain roads may be closed for extended periods. Snow tires or chains may be required in certain provinces or mountain towns. If you are renting a car in winter months and driving to a ski resort, check with your car rental company to ensure your vehicle is properly equipped.

Be alert when you drive through autobahn construction zones, particularly on the A-1 East/West Autobahn. **Traffic information** and road conditions are broadcast on the **English-language channel, FM4** (frequency depends on location). Traffic information is posted on digital signs, and trackable in popular mobile apps. Emergency roadside help and information may be reached by dialing **123** or **120** for vehicle assistance and towing services (Austrian automobile clubs), **122** for the fire department, **133** for police, and **144** for ambulance. The European emergency line is **112**.

**Traffic Laws**: Please see Austria’s [travel webpage](http://www.austria.info/us/basic-facts/getting-there-around/austria-by-car) for detailed information related to driving. Below are key laws to consider:

* Penalties for **driving under the influence** are stricter than in many U.S. states.
* **Display an “**[**autobahn vignette**](https://www.asfinag.at/toll/vignette/toll-sticker/)**” highway-tax sticker** on the inside of the vehicle’s windshield. The fine for failing to display a valid sticker is EUR 120 ($150 USD), paid in cash “on the spot.”
* The **maximum speed** limit is 130 km/hr (81mph) on the Austrian autobahns.
* It is **against the law** to use a **hand-held cell** phone while driving.
* It is **against the law** to turn **right on red**.
* It is **mandatory** for cars on Austrian motorways to pull over when an emergency vehicle is approaching. On two-lane roads or larger, vehicles pull over to either far left or far right to create an emergency corridor down the center.
* You could be issued a **substantial fine** for not usin **winter tires** on your vehicle between November 1 and April 15, depending where you are driving. Your car **insurance is void** if you are in an accident, and your vehicle does not havewinter tires.
* Read your rental contract closely.You may be **arrested, fined**, and/or charged with attempted auto theft if you try to drive a rental car in countries listed as “prohibited” on the car rental contract.
* **A U.S. driver's license**alone is**not sufficient to drive in Austria.** A U.S. driver's license must be accompanied by an international driving permit or by an official translation of the U.S. driver's license, which can be obtained in the United States at AAA, or at one of the Austrian automobile clubs (ÖAMTC or ARBÖ). U.S. citizens who intend to take up residence in Austria must obtain an Austrian driver’s license after six months of arriving.

**Public Transportation:**Austrian Federal Railways ([Österreichische Bundesbahnen](http://www.oebb.at/en/)) offers train service to all major towns in Austria and major cities in Europe. There is also an extensive network of Österreichische Post [bus lines](http://www.postbus.at/en/). All major cities have excellent public transportation systems.
