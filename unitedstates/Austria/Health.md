* Ambulance services are widely available.

Local hospitals will not settle accounts directly with American insurance companies. **You must pay the hospital’s bill and later claim reimbursement from the insurance carrier in the United States.**The Austrian Medicine Import Act prohibits the import of most prescription drugs into Austria. However, non- European Union residents are allowed medicines as part of their personal luggage, but only the quantity required for the period of time you’ll be in the country. Travelers may not receive medicine by mail from abroad while in Austria. If a particular medication is not available in Austria, an Austrian pharmacy may be able to order the medication prescribed by a local physician from a pharmacy in the United States.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most health care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals on its [website](https://at.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Austrian Ministry for Health](https://www.sozialministerium.at/siteEN/Health/Information_for_Travellers/) to ensure the medication is legal in Austria.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health Facilities**

* Austria has world class healthcare facilities throughout the country.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” or adequate health insurance prior to service or admission. Patients who need emergency or life-saving medical treatment will not be turned away for lack of payment or insurance.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Austria.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Many medications that are common in the United States are illegal in Austria, even with a prescription. Austria does not allow the importation of any pharmaceuticals that contain narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Obtaining such medications in Austria is either impossible or requires a diagnosis and prescription from an Austrian doctor. Please review the medication rules on the websites of the [Austrian Embassy](https://www.austria.org/consular-services) in Washington, D.C., and the [Austrian Health Ministry](https://www.sozialministerium.at/en.html).
* COVID-19 tests in Austria are widely available at local Apoteken (pharmacies), including rapid and PCR tests. U.S. citizens are responsible for paying for all costs upfront. Results are normally delivered by e-mail, test or you may request a physical copy from the lab.
* The COVID-19 vaccine is available free of charge for U.S. citizen residents of Austria and hold valid Austrian healthcare E-cards. U.S. citizen visitors may be required to pay vaccination costs upfront.

**Altitude**

Many cities in western Austria are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.
