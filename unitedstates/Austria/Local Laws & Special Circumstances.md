# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are **arrested or detained**, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* You can expect long jail sentences and heavy finesfor possessing, using, or trafficking in **illegal drugs** in Austria. If you break Austrian laws, **your** **U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution**.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection may confiscate the items or fine you, if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Austria. The LGB community is well-developed in larger cities, including Vienna, Graz, Linz, Innsbruck, and Salzburg. LGB organizations operate freely. While there is some societal prejudice against LGB persons, Austria has become more liberal with laws and social opinion concerning sexual orientation. Anti-discrimination laws also apply to LGB persons. Same sex couples are permitted to marry or enter a legally recognized civil union.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Laws in Austria prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities, and are enforced. Accessibility is limited in older buildings, including restaurants, cafes, hotels, castles, and other tourist attractions especially outside of major cities. Rentals, repair and replacement parts for wheelchairs, orthopedics, and other equipment are available in major cities.
