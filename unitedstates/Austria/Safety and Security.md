# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Some terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – against soft targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:** Austria has one of the lowest crime rates in Europe and violent crime is rare. Crimes of opportunity involving theft of personal property do occur. These crimes frequently occur in tourist areas, including the plaza around St. Stephen’s Cathedral and the nearby pedestrian shopping areas in Vienna’s First District.

* Beware of **pickpockets** on public transportation and in bus or train stations. Trains between Vienna and Budapest, Prague, or Rome are high-risk.
* Do not leave bags unattended.
* Do not carry your passport when sightseeing within Vienna; lock it in your hotel safe or other secure area unless needed for travel. Instead, carry a photocopy of your passport at all times along with a second form of ID such as a U.S. driver’s license.

**Demonstrations** are common. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
