Hospitals and medical facilities in Liberia are poorly equipped and are incapable of providing many services. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, you should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment. Within Liberia, medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, possibly counterfeit, and generally unavailable in most areas.

Malaria and yellow fever are prevalent throughout the country. Yellow fever immunization is required to enter Liberia and recommended for all residents. Chemoprophylaxis (anti-malarial medication) is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays.

You should:

* Carry and use insect repellents containing either 20 percent DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535.
* Treat clothing and tents with permethrin.
* Sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.
* Emergency services are absent or are unreliable in most areas. Some medical facilities in Monrovia do have ambulances but they use these vehicles primarily for patient transport. Emergency services such as those in the United States do not exist in Liberia.
* Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Liberia](http://www.liberianembassyus.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Liberia. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
