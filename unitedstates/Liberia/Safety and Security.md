# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Liberia's police force has limited resources. The Liberia National Police have a strong presence in Monrovia, but less of a presence outside of the capital city. The police can be both a source of assistance and a source of problems for visitors. Travelers may be detained by police officers soliciting bribes. You are encouraged to carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times as proof of identity and citizenship. If detained or arrested, you should ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately.

You should be aware of your surroundings at all times and use caution when moving around, especially at night. Travel outside of Monrovia after dark is strongly discouraged, as roads are in poor condition and there are few public street lights. U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark (with the exception of travel to and from Roberts International Airport).

Avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness.

**Crime:**Crimes of opportunity, such as residential burglary or armed robbery (typically using a knife or machete) have affected U.S. citizens and are more common at night. Criminal activity has been reported in both urban and rural areas, including public beaches. The Liberia National Police have limited capacity to respond to crime events.

The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Liberia is also 911. However, emergency services are not provided reliably or consistently. Also, there is no landline telephone service in Liberia, and cellular phone communication is subject to occasional disruptions in service. A call to 911 in Liberia may go unanswered, and you should employ other resources to obtain emergency assistance.

**Corruption:** Corruption is rampant. Poorly paid government officials and private company employees may ask for “fees” for doing their job, and travelers may be inconvenienced for not paying bribes. Requesting official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected “fines” or “fees” can sometimes deter such improper behavior.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. While infrequent, the police may use tear gas.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams occur in Liberia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance as needed and contact the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible.

Report crimes to the local police in person or at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (231) 77-677-7000.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk.
