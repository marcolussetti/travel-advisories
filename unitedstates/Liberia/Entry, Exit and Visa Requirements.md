**COVID-19 Requirements:**

o  Proof of vaccination against COVID-19 is required for entry. See Traveler’s Protocol at <http://moh.gov.lr/>

**Requirements for Entry:**

* World Health Organization (WHO) card with [yellow fever vaccination](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prophylaxis-information-by-country/south-sudan)

If you do not obtain a Liberian visa prior to arrival, you may be deported immediately. Visit the [Embassy of Liberia](http://www.liberianembassyus.org/) website for the most current visa information.

Sums in excess of $10,000 USD must be reported at the port of entry, and no more than $7,500 USD in foreign currency banknotes can be moved out of the country at one time. Larger sums must be transferred via bank drafts or other financial instruments.

Expect strict enforcement of border controls, and occasional border crossing closings, by Liberian, Ivorian, Sierra Leonean, and Guinean authorities. Corruption has been reported at many border locations and you may be asked for money prior to crossing the border. Some travelers have found that asking for official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected “fines” can deter requests for bribes.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Liberia.
