Exercise increased caution in Liberia due to **crime** and **civil unrest.**

**Country summary:**  Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common, particularly in urban areas and on public beaches.  Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crimes.

Demonstrations occur regularly and have on occasion resulted in violence or use of tear gas by authorities.

If traveling in Liberia, make all efforts to complete your travel during daylight hours due to increased safety hazards at night.  U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark (with the exception of travel to and from Roberts International Airport).

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/liberia.html) for additional information on travel to Liberia.
