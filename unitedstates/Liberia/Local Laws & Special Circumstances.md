# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Liberia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116)website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Photographs:** Photographing military installations, air and sea ports, and important government buildings is prohibited. You should not take photographs of sites or activities that may be considered sensitive, as police may confiscate the camera.

**Infrastructure:** Lodging, fuel, transportation, utilities, and telephone services are not consistently available, especially outside of Monrovia. Hotel rooms can be difficult to find without an advance reservation. There is no working landline telephone system in Liberia. You should rent or purchase a local cellular phone. Commercial air courier service is available.

**Financial Issues:** The Liberian dollar is the official currency; however, the U.S. dollar is accepted as legal tender. Liberian dollars are preferred for smaller purchases, especially outside of Monrovia. Wire transfers may be limited and subject to fees if you do not have a Liberian bank account. ATMs are not widely available. Due to a cash shortage in Liberia’s banking sector, it is difficult to obtain adequate cash supplies – both Liberian and U.S. dollars – from ATMs and banks. Traveler's checks and credit cards are not regularly accepted, except at some major hotels in Monrovia. There have been some reports of financial information being compromised even at hotels where credit cards are routinely accepted; always keep your credit card in sight.

**Swimming Hazards:**Do not swim alone or after dark and do not walk on any beach after dark. Travelers should seek out and heed posted warnings and refrain from bathing at unmarked, unpatrolled beaches.

Do not swim in the Atlantic Ocean if you are unfamiliar with swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast. The Liberia Weather Service does not provide information on where and when these tides form, and there are no lifeguards posted on beaches. In some areas, the water may be contaminated with sewage.

Avoid use of alcohol or mind-altering drugs while engaging in water sports. Avoid water where sewage contamination or algae are present. Avoid any exposure (rafting, swimming, or wading) in water known to be infected with schistosomiasis (bilharzia).

Scuba dive only with personnel certified by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) or the National Associated of Underwater Instructors (NAUI); use equipment only from PADI- or NAUI-certified dive operators. Follow established timetables for air travel after diving. The time from the end of the dive until the boarding of an aircraft is generally between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the type of dive.

Decline water transportation in vessels without personal flotation devices or life jackets.

Wear appropriate footwear when walking, wading, or swimming to avoid injury and exposure to parasites and poisonous plants and animals.

Risk from jellyfish exists, including highly venomous Portuguese man-of-war. Travelers wading, launching boats, or fishing are especially at risk. Risk from coral, stonefish, and sea urchins exists.

Sit on a towel, blanket, or piece of clothing if a chair or hammock is not available because sand may be contaminated in areas frequented by animals. Thoroughly shake out all fabrics after use.

Avoid eating amberjack, bonito, mackerel, mahi-mahi, or tuna due to risk of scombroid poisoning. Low risk of ciguatera poisoning exists in coastal areas and is presumed to have widespread distribution. Travelers should also avoid consumption of reef fish such as amberjack, barracuda, grouper, and snapper. The toxin remains even when these fish are well cooked.

**LGB Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Liberia. Voluntary sodomy is a first-degree misdemeanor with penalties ranging up to one year in prison.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Liberia prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced to the extent possible. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is reported as comparable to the United States due to the visibility of people who are living with injuries sustained in the civil wars or from polio. Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

Individuals may be able to purchase second-hand equipment from street markets. Durable medical equipment stores do not exist in Liberia; therefore, anyone who needs equipment or devices should bring them to Liberia. Liberia does not provide hearing aids or repair of hearing aids. Services such as sign language are very limited and only available in Monrovia. Additionally, Liberia does not have an agency that trains or staffs personal assistants for those with disabilities. Individuals needing a personal care assistant would need to hire and train the personal care assistant.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Rape is a crime in Liberia punishable by up to life in prison. However, the Liberian government does not effectively enforce the law, and rape is a serious and pervasive problem. Domestic violence also remains a serious problem despite being punishable by up to six months in prison.

Although female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) was banned by a proclamation of the National Council of Chiefs and Elders in 2023, it is not specifically against the law in Liberia.
