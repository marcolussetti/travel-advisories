# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Suriname immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Credit Cards:** Credit cards are not widely accepted outside major hotels and upscale restaurants. While several banks accept U.S. ATM cards, the use of debit and credit cards is discouraged because of identity theft concerns. Keep your debit or credit card in your sight at all times while it is being processed. Consider using prepaid credit cards with limited funds when traveling. You can exchange currency at banks, hotels, and official exchange houses (“cambios”). Exchanging money outside of these locations is illegal and can be dangerous.

**Communications:** Areas outside of major cities may not have reliable cell phone reception.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Suriname.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Suriname prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Accessibility is significantly less in areas outside of the capital city.

* There are NGOs in Suriname that rent aids/equipment/devices and provide sign language interpreters. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Suriname to receive a list of providers.
