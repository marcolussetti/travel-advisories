# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**  The major roads in Paramaribo are usually paved but are not always well maintained.

* Cars drive on the left side of the road.
* Large potholes are common, especially during the rainy season.
* Roads often are not marked with traffic lines.
* Many main roads do not have sidewalks, forcing pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles to share the same space.
* Many roads flood, and cars with low clearance may have problems.
* The East-West Highway stretches from Nieuw Nickerie in the west to Albina in the east. Parts of the road are not well maintained, and during the rainy season, sinkholes develop along the road.
* Watch for slow-moving traffic or animals.
* Exercise caution at night due to poor lighting and sharp road turns without adequate warning signs.
* There are few service stations along the road, and western-style rest stops are non-existent.
* Roads in the interior are dirt roads passing through sparsely populated rain forest. Bridges are in poor condition. Conditions deteriorate rapidly during the rainy season.
* There are no lights, service stations, or emergency call boxes along the roads.
* Consult with your hotel or tour provider regarding road conditions.

**Traffic Laws:** Seat belts are required. Driving while talking on a cell phone is illegal; you must use a hands-free device. You need an international driver’s license to rent a car. Excessive speed, unpredictable driving habits, unusual right of way patterns, poorly maintained roads, relatively few traffic lights, and a lack of basic safety equipment on many vehicles are daily hazards. If you are in a significant accident, leave your car where the accident occurred, call the police, and wait until police arrive.

If you are in an accident and suspected of driving under the influence, the police might take you to the nearest medical center to measure your alcohol level. They will hold you for up to six hours until the results of your blood alcohol content are available.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid using public minibuses due to unsafe driving habits and poor maintenance. Avoid using motorcycles or scooters.

Not all taxis are clearly marked and some may not have a meter.

* Verify the price or meter before entering the taxi.
* Use hotel concierge taxis.
