A Yellow Fever vaccine is required in some cases. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/suriname) for more information.

Medical care is limited in many areas of the country and does not meet U.S. standards.

* There is one public emergency room in Paramaribo.
* Medical specialists may not always be available.
* In general, hospital facilities are not air conditioned.
* Emergency medical care outside Paramaribo is limited and is virtually non-existent in the interior of the country.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment prior to service or admission. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* You can find prescription and over-the-counter medicines in pharmacies in Paramaribo, but the quality cannot be assured. There are frequent prescription medication shortages.
* Over-the-counter medications are generally available, but U.S. brands may not be available.
* The Government of Suriname requires that travelers arriving from or transiting through countries with risk of yellow fever transmission show proof of a yellow fever vaccination. Note that you may also be required to show proof of yellow fever vaccination upon departure from Suriname if traveling to or transiting through another country that requires it.

For emergency services in Suriname, dial 115. You may also contact services directly at:

* Fire Department: 110
* Police: 115
* EMS: 113

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Paramaribo and Nickerie.
* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://gov.sr/ministeries/ministerie-van-volksgezondheid/#) to ensure the medication is legal in Suriname.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Pharmaceuticals**

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* Suriname does not allow the importation of cannabidiol (CBD). Travelers should avoid carrying medications containing CBD.

**Water Quality**

In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
