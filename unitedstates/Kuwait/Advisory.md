Exercise normal precautions in Kuwait.  Some areas have higher risks.  Read this whole Travel Advisory.

* Exercise increased caution in the Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh area in Kuwait City because of crime.
* Do not travel to the desert area near the border with Iraq because of bombs, shells, and landmines left over from the 1990 Gulf War.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).  This is due to risks to civil aviation from political and military tensions in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Kuwait.  The notice advises U.S. operators to review current security and threat information and to report safety or security incidents.  For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).

* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Stay alert in places visited by large groups of people and travelers or tourists.
* Keep travel documents up to date and easy to access.
* Make back-up plans to leave the country.

**Desert Area North of the Mutla’a Ridge and Near the Border with Iraq – Level 4:  Do Not Travel**

Desert areas and some beaches north of the Mutla’a Ridge still have unexploded bombs, shells, and landmines left over from the 1990 Gulf War.  Avoid areas that are “off the beaten path” and do not touch or move objects in that area.  They could explode.  These locations are not clearly marked, or the signs might be difficult to understand.  Do not travel to these areas for any reason.

**Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh Neighborhoods – Level 2:  Exercise Increased Caution**

The Kuwaiti police report that the neighborhood of Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh near the Kuwait International Airport is a high-crime area.
