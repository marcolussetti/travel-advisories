[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Potential for Terrorist Activity:** Kuwait continues to face the threat of terrorism. Terrorists may target U.S. citizens and interests in the Arabian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula.

For more information see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Criminal activity is low. Nonetheless, reported incidents include petty theft, car break-ins, and harassment or sexual assault of women traveling alone.

The Embassy recommends that U.S. government personnel exercise increased caution in the Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh area in Kuwait City due to crime. See the Kuwait [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/kuwait-travel-advisory.html) for more information.

**Desert Region Near the Border of Iraq:** U.S. government personnel are prohibited from personal travel in the desert region within five kilometers of the Kuwait-Iraq border. See the Kuwait [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/kuwait-travel-advisory.html) for more information.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Kuwait. Review the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams?__cf_chl_tk=9n1z_8UQIBiiy6GxW7uElAcbsA3wGgrs7ewlsYOQ.Ak-1739909659-1.0.1.1-mDLXLvO1qXXK3M5VTjedR6NJu4b5cxFrWzT_bXKsdyA) pages for more information.

Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the Embassy at +965-2259-1001. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.
