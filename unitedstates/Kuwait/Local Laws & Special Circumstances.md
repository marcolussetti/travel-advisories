# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. Individuals who violate local laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits and licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

**Alcohol and Drugs:**

* **Possession of alcohol and/or narcotics is illegal.**
* Convictions for possession, use, and trafficking of drugs may include heavy fines, long jail sentences, or the death penalty.

The following actions are illegal and may also lead to prosecution, imprisonment, and immediate deportation:

* Humiliating or insulting any person verbally or through obscene gestures in a public place, including a police officer, public official, or private citizen.
* Taking pictures or video clips of government buildings, military installations, and oil-related infrastructure or of people without the subject’s knowledge or consent.
* Having unpaid debts.
* Driving without a Kuwait driver’s license after obtaining a residence permit.
* Gambling.
* Prostitution and pornography.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and [the Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Travel Bans:** Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, immigration violations, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in the imposition of a travel ban, which will prohibit departure from Kuwait until the issue is resolved and the travel ban is lifted. U.S. citizens in Kuwait who are involved in disputes or investigations can check whether they have a travel ban by entering their civil ID number on the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior website, found [here](https://rnt.moi.gov.kw/esrv/Start.do). Since multiple Kuwaiti government agencies can impose travel bans, this database is not exhaustive. More information on travel bans in Kuwait is available [here](https://kw.usembassy.gov/travel-bans/).

**Children Born Out of Wedlock:** Sexual relations outside of marriage are a criminal offense. Parents may not be able to obtain a Kuwait birth certificate or residence permit for a child born out of wedlock and may be subject to prosecution and/or fines to document the birth of the child.

**Customs:** Alcohol, pork products, and pornography are prohibited.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**Consensual same-sex sexual activity between men is illegal. The law punishes consensual intercourse between men of full age (21 and older) with imprisonment of up of to seven years. Men of full age who engage in consensual intercourse with men under age 21 may be imprisoned up to ten years. No laws criminalize same-sex sexual activity between women. Some LGB travelers have reported difficulties entering Kuwait on a passport bearing a name and photo that do not correspond to their sex at birth, including harassment, detention, abuse, and assault by security forces. Societal discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientationis common.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report on Kuwait](https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/kuwait/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Accessibility and accommodations in Kuwait are different from those in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with permanent physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other government services. The law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities.

 Public transportation is generally inaccessible for patrons with disabilities. Accessible parking spaces are marked, but often unavailable. Most medical facilities and public buildings have wheelchair ramps and elevators. Access to sign language interpretation is limited; Americans needing American Sign Language interpretation should plan ahead and have contact information for companies offering distance interpretation services through mobile phone apps, video phones, and other modalities.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Many public places have dress codes for women requiring shoulders and knees to be covered. Women, especially those traveling alone, should exercise particular caution on public transit, when traveling via taxi, and in conservative or isolated areas. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).
