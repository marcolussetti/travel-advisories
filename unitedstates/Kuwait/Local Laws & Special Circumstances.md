# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. Individuals who violate local laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits and licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

**Alcohol and Drugs:**

* Possession or importation of alcohol, narcotic drugs, and marijuana is illegal.
* Convictions for possession, use, and trafficking of drugs may include heavy fines, long jail sentences, or the death penalty.
* Transporting, holding, or accepting a package containing drugs on behalf of another individual can result in arrest and conviction, even if you are unaware of the package contents.

**Illegal Activities:** The following actions are illegal and may also lead to prosecution, imprisonment, and immediate deportation:

* Humiliating or insulting any person verbally or through obscene gestures in a public place, including a police officer, public official, or private citizen.
* There are limitations on freedom of speech and political expression in Kuwait, especially on social media.  Insulting the Amir is a crime.
* Taking pictures or video clips of government buildings, military installations, and oil-related infrastructure or of people without the subject’s knowledge or consent.
* Having unpaid debts.
* Driving without a Kuwait driver’s license after obtaining a residence permit.
* Possession of firearms, ammunition, or other weapons.
* Gambling.
* Prostitution and pornography.
* Sexual relations outside of marriage.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Review our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Travel Bans:** Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, immigration violations, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in the imposition of a travel ban, which will prohibit departure from Kuwait until the issue is resolved and the travel ban is lifted. U.S. citizens in Kuwait who are involved in disputes or investigations can check whether they have a travel ban by entering their civil ID number on the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior website, found [here](https://rnt.moi.gov.kw/esrv/Start.do?lang=eng#mobSec). Since multiple Kuwaiti government agencies can impose travel bans, this database is not exhaustive. More information on travel bans in Kuwait is available [here](https://kw.usembassy.gov/travel-bans/).

**Children Born Out of Wedlock:** Engaging in sexual relations outside of marriage is a criminal offense. Parents may not be able to obtain a Kuwait birth certificate or residence permit for a child born out of wedlock and may be subject to prosecution and/or fines to document the birth of the child.

**Customs:** Alcohol, pork products, and pornography are prohibited.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

* Men of full age who engage in consensual intercourse with men under age 21 may be imprisoned up to ten years.

Review our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) and section 6 of our [Human Rights](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/kuwait/) report for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Accessibility and accommodations in Kuwait are different from those in the United States. The Kuwaiti laws prohibit discrimination against persons with permanent physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other government services. The law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities.

Public transportation is generally inaccessible for patrons with disabilities. Accessible parking spaces are marked, but often unavailable. Most medical facilities and public buildings have wheelchair ramps and elevators. Access to sign language interpretation is limited; U.S. citizens needing American Sign Language interpretation should plan ahead and have contact information for companies offering distance interpretation services through mobile phone apps, video phones, and other modalities.

**Women Travelers:** Many public places have dress codes for women requiring shoulders and knees to be covered. Women, especially those traveling alone, should exercise particular caution on public transit, when traveling via taxi, and in conservative or isolated areas.
