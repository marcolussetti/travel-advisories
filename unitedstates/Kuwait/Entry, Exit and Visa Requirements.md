As of June 9, 2022, the Kuwaiti government has resumed issuing visas on arrival to U.S. citizens visiting Kuwait. The visas are free for U.S. citizens and allow the visa holder to stay up to three months in Kuwait. To obtain a visa on arrival, U.S. citizens arriving in Kuwait must:

* Have a return ticket
* Not be restricted from entry to Kuwait
* Have a passport valid for at least six months after the date of arrival in Kuwait
* Provide the address of the place they will stay in Kuwait

Visit the website of the [Embassy of Kuwait](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Kuwait.html#ExternalPopup) in Washington, DC, and its Consulates General in Los Angeles and New York City for the most current visa information.

Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Kuwait. Residency permits require an HIV/AIDS test and permits may be denied if applicants test positive. If HIV-related illness becomes known, the resident must leave the country or be deported.

Please see the [CDC's travel page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Kuwait.html#ExternalPopup) for more travel-related health information.

**Residence Permits/Civil IDs:**U.S. citizens seeking residency in Kuwait should have all the required legal documents authenticated the [Department of State Office of Authentications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications.html)and attested by the Embassy of Kuwait in Washington, DC or the Consulates General in Los Angeles or New York before arriving in Kuwait. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait cannot provide this service.

If you are a resident and lose your new Civil ID and/or U.S. passport while outside of Kuwait, you must obtain a No Objection Certificate from the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Kuwait to enter as a resident since losing your U.S. passport invalidates your Civil ID. You may enter using a U.S. emergency passport.

**Department of Defense Travelers:** The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait strongly advises active members of the U.S. military and military contractors arriving or departing on military air to contact the Theater Gateway office at 2221-6340 to ensure they go through the proper entrance or exit procedures in Kuwait.
