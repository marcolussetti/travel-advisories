**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving in Kuwait is extremely hazardous due to excessive speeding, distracted driving, road rage, lax enforcement of traffic regulations, and a high volume of traffic. All major highways in Kuwait are dangerous due to excessive speeding. Roads have adequate signage. Passersby and emergency personnel react to accidents appropriately. Exercise increased caution when driving at night as some drivers do no use headlights. Drivers should avoid driving after heavy rainstorms or through standing water, be alert for flooded areas, and monitor local media for road closures and weather updates.

**Traffic Laws:**

* You are required to have your driver’s license with you at all times when operating a vehicle. There are no exceptions.
* Driving while intoxicated can result in fines, imprisonment, deportation, and/or revocation of your Kuwait driving license.
* It is against the law to use cell phones or text while driving.
* Use of seat belts is mandatory.
* Requests for bribes are uncommon.
* In case of emergency or traffic accident, call **112**.
* Involvement in an accident, whether or not you are at fault, can lead to arrest and detention. Immediately notify the police and remain at the scene until the police arrive.
* If you are injured in an accident that may result in a legal claim against you or that you wish to file against another party, you must seek medical attention at a public hospital. At the public hospital, an investigator will document your injuries. Failure to do this will limit your ability to seek legal remedy for any injuries you have suffered.
* At-fault accidents can result in arrests, demands for financial restitution, and/or travel bans preventing you from leaving Kuwait. Police at checkpoints may fine motorists arbitrarily.
* Traffic cameras capture stop light and speeding violations.
* Nonpayment of traffic and parking fines can result in seizure of your vehicle and travel bans. This means you cannot leave Kuwait until all fines and penalties are paid. You can pay traffic fines online through the [MOI’s online portal](https://rnt.moi.gov.kw/esrv/Start.do?lang=eng#mobSec).

**Public Transportation:**

* Use only marked and licensed taxis. Taxis are available at major hotels and by telephone.
* Do not sit in the front seat of taxis with the driver.
* Do not allow the driver to pick up unknown passengers or enter a taxi occupied by someone in addition to the driver.
* Be aware of the route driven by the taxi driver and ensure that the driver does not take you to an unfamiliar area.
* As with driving personal vehicles, remember to vary routes and times when utilizing taxis.
* Women should exercise increased caution when riding public buses due to sexual harassment.
