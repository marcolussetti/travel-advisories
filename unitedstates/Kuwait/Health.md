[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Healthcare is adequate and accessible both in the government-run system and many private institutions. The government facilities provide services for foreigners at reasonable costs, and payment for all services is expected in advance. Government facilities offer more specialty care services, though wait times are often long and difficult to access for non-nationals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Some medical services are below U.S. standards. Most prescription and over-the-counter medicines are readily available at pharmacies. Emergency services are generally very responsive.

* For emergency services in Kuwait, dial **112**.
* Ambulance services are widely available in certain areas but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Kuwait will accept cash or credit card payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Embassy of Kuwait](http://www.kuwaitembassy.us/) in Washington, DC, the [Consulate General of Kuwait in Los Angeles](http://www.kuwaitconsulate.org/consular-services/consulate-services/), [the Consulate General of Kuwait in New York City](http://www.kuwaitmissionun.org/visa-information.html), or the Kuwait General Administration for Customs (Email : [minfo@customs.gov.kw.com](mailto:minfo@customs.gov.kw.com). Telephone: (+965) 24955000, Fax: (+965) 24838056) to ensure the medication is legal in Kuwait.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurancehttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) (CDC) and the [Kuwait Ministry of Health](https://www.e.gov.kw/sites/kgoEnglish/Pages/CitizensResidents/Health/BasicVaccinationsInKuwait.aspx). Please note that Kuwait’s vaccination requirements for residents are different and may require more inoculations than recommended by the CDC.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in Kuwait. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Kuwait.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
