* For emergency services in Kuwait, dial 112.
* Ambulance services are widely available in certain areas, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

Healthcare is adequate and accessible both in the government-run system and many private institutions. Government facilities provide services for foreigners at reasonable costs, and payment for all services is expected in advance. Government facilities offer more specialty care services, though wait times are often long and difficult to access for non-nationals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Some medical services are below U.S. standards. Most prescription and over-the-counter medicines are readily available at pharmacies. Emergency services are generally very responsive.

The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Kuwait will accept cash or credit card payments. See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867). Visit the U.S. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription Medications:** Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Some prescription drugs which are legal in the United States are not legal in Kuwait, and bringing them in your luggage could result in denial of entry or criminal penalties.  Check with the [Embassy of Kuwait](https://washington.mofa.gov.kw/en/) in Washington, DC, the [Consulate General of Kuwait in Los Angeles](https://washington.mofa.gov.kw/en/consular-section-jurisdictions-in-the-usa/), the [Consulate General of Kuwait in New York City](https://washington.mofa.gov.kw/en/consular-section-jurisdictions-in-the-usa/), or the Kuwait General Administration for Customs: <https://customs.gov.kw/ContactUs> (Email: [info@customs.gov.kw](mailto:info@customs.gov.kw) , Telephone: (+965) 24955000, Fax: (+965) 24838056) to ensure the medication is legal in Kuwait.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/kuwait) (CDC) and the [Kuwait Ministry of Health](https://www.e.gov.kw/sites/kgoEnglish/Pages/CitizensResidents/Health/BasicVaccinationsInKuwait.aspx). Please note that Kuwait’s vaccination requirements for residents are different and may require more inoculations than recommended by the CDC.
