**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**U.S.citizens have had serious issues, and some have died during or after cosmetic or elective surgery.

Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Understand that medical systems abroad are different than in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone traveling for medical purposes should consult with their physician before traveling.

Visit the [CDC](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwwwnc.cdc.gov.mcas.ms%2Ftravel%2Fpage%2Fmedical-tourism%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567) website for information on Medical Tourism, its risks, and what you can do to prepare.

Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Costa Rica.

Costa Rica has many elective and cosmetic surgery facilities that can match those in the United States, but the quality of care can vary. If you’re considering surgery in Costa Rica, make sure that emergency medical services are accessible. Make sure the professionals you choose are accredited and qualified. Always do your research to make informed decisions about your health.

Confirm that:

* Clinics and doctors will be able to provide an acceptable level of care.
* Your insurance will cover any related or emergency costs.
* You understand the costs and terms of payment for treatment.

For clinics offering alternative treatments, do your research. Unverified alternative treatments have led to hospitalization. Wellness centers are often not verified.

**Alcohol:** Drink alcohol in moderation. There have been reports of tainted alcohol causing serious health issues. If you feel sick after drinking, call 911 immediately. Costa Rica asks you to report the sale of unregulated or tainted alcohol to the Investigative Police (OIJ). Their phone number is 800-8000-645 and email is [denuncias.drpis@misalud.go.cr](mailto:denuncias.drpis@misalud.go.cr). You can also call the National Center for Intoxicants at 2223-1028 or 800-INTOXICA (4686-9422). If you are the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the U.S. Embassy in San Jose at +506-2519-2000. You can contact the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries). The Bureau is available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:** If you are considering traveling to Costa Rica to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

**Water Quality:** Tap water is often not safe to drink. Bottled water is a better choice. Many places may serve tap water unless you ask for bottled. Be aware that ice for drinks may be using tap water.
