**Emergency services**For emergencies **dial 911**

**Ambulance services**Ambulances might not have all the advanced emergency equipment you would expect.

**Health facilities**In San José, medical care is usually good. Outside of San José, services may be limited.

* Some healthcare facilities might lack basic medical equipment.
* Hospitals and doctors often need payment “up front” before service or admission.
* Private hospitals usually want payment or proof of insurance before treating you.
* In public hospitals, medical staff may speak little or no English.
* In public hospitals, only a few staff members may be present overnight. We recommend you request permission for a family member to stay with you

**Prescription medications**Check the [Costa Rican Ministry of Health](https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/) to ensure your medicine is approved and sold locally.

* Bring enough medication for your trip.
* Some medications are not available and cannot be sent in the mail to Costa Rica.
* Carry your prescription medicine in the original packaging with a copy of your prescription.
* Buy medicine in consultation with a doctor and from reputable establishments.
* Medicine that is bought overseas needs to meet U.S. requirements to be taken back to the United States.

Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1444?language=en_US#:~:text=A%20rule%20of%20thumb%3A%20Bring,while%20visiting%20the%20United%20States.) and the [Food and Drug Administration websites](https://www.fda.gov/) for more information.

**Medical payments and insurance**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.

* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not work overseas.
* Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.
* Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
* Make sure your health insurance plan [provides coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for reimbursement of payments. The CDC provides more information on [types of insurance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) available.
* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. An air ambulance flight can cost $50,000 and will often take place only after full payment is provided.

Costa Rica reserves the right to prevent the departure of people with unpaid bills.
