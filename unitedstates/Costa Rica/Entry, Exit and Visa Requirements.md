# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

See the Embassy of Costa Rica’s [website](http://costarica-embassy.org/)for the most current visa information.

**General Entry Requirements:**

* **Passport** valid for duration of stay. Immigration may deny entry if passport is damaged.
* **Return ticket** or proof of onward travel to another country.
* **Proof of yellow fever vaccination** if you are arriving from [certain countries](http://www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/109#6) in South America or Africa.

**Tourist stays up to 180 Days:** Authorities may permit stays up to 180 days without a visa but are not required to do so. Be sure to leave by your required date of departure. Immigration authorities may fine foreigners who overstay their visas. Any overstay may cause delays, deportation, and/or denial of entry to Costa Rica in the future.

**Entry and Exit for Minor Children:** All children born in Costa Rica acquire Costa Rican citizenship at birth. All Costa Rican minors must have an exit permit issued by immigration authorities to depart the country. Non-Costa Rican minor children who are residents of Costa Rica may also be subject to this rule. This is strictly enforced. Parents of minors born in Costa Rica should consult [Costa Rican immigration authorities](https://www.migracion.go.cr/Paginas/Pasaportes-y-Permisos-de-Salida.aspx) before traveling.

**Indebtedness:** If you owe money in Costa Rica, you may not be allowed to leave. This includes bills from car accidents or medical bills. If you owe child support in Costa Rica, you may need to pay up to 13 months of support before leaving.

**Documentation Requirements:** Always carry copies of your ID and immigration papers. Local authorities may ask for your original passport and documents. They can detain you to check your identity and immigration status.
