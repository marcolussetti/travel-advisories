# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Petty theft and pickpocketing are common crimes affecting U.S. travelers. More serious crimes, like sexual assault and murder, have also taken place. Armed robbers usually want your smartphone, wallet, or purse. If someone with a weapon confronts you, you are recommended not to resist. Do not leave valuables unattended on the beach to go into the water or in an unlocked room. Do not leave valuables in an unattended vehicle. Even a locked car in an area with parking attendants can be a target. Police recommend travelers physically check car doors are locked because thieves have used jammers to block car key fobs. Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, especially after dark. Always be aware of your surroundings and keep your valuables out of sight.

The Embassy has received reports of robberies at isolated rental properties. Make sure your rental has adequate security and lock all doors and windows.

**Tourism:** The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) [website](https://www.ict.go.cr/en/) has a list of [Certified Tour Guides](https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/planning-your-trip/tour-guides-directory). ICT also has safety and security information in [these English and Spanish language pamphlets.](https://www.visitcostarica.com/es/costa-rica/more/publications/security-brochures)

**Adventure Sports:** Some tour operators may not follow international standards and best practices. Be careful when doing adventure activities such as hiking, rafting, zip lining, or sky diving. U. S. citizens have died in Costa Rica while doing adventure sports. Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport. Check our section on Medical Insurance under “Health” below. The Ministry of Health maintains a list of approved Adventure Sports operators. Do not do adventure sports alone. Always carry ID and let others know where you are. Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Even popular rafting spots can become dangerous in flash floods. Carry a first aid kit and know where the nearest rescue center is. Follow all local or park rules and be careful in unknown places.

**Hiking:** Follow signs in national parks and stay on marked trails. It can be hard for first responders to find missing people in remote areas.

To hike in national parks, you should:

* Register with the park
* Have an entry permit
* Use a certified tour operator. The [Costa Rican Tourist Institute (ICT)](https://www.ict.go.cr/en/) has information on [Certified Tour Guides](https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/planning-your-trip/tour-guides-directory).

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is regulated, and rules are enforced. Inspections take place on a regular basis, but some tour operators are not registered. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signs. Medical treatment is available, but traffic and road conditions can delay access to remote areas. U. S. citizens should consider [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should first contact 911. Victims should also contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Students and Volunteers:** See safety and security information provided by your host. Students and volunteers have been victims of serious crimes. You can file a complaint to [Costa Rica’s Tourism Commission.](https://www.ict.go.cr/en/) Their phone is 800-TURISMO from Costa Rica or 011-506-2299-5800 from the United States. Their email is [contactenos@ict.go.cr](mailto:contactenos@ict.go.cr).

**Natural Disasters:** Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone.

* **Three volcanoes**, two near San Jose and one in the northwest, have become more active. Eruptions from Turrialba can disrupt air traffic and cause breathing issues. Follow park service guidance and alerts about volcanic activity.  Never try to climb or access an active volcano without permission.
* **Tsunamis** can happen after significant earthquakes.
* **Flooding** is common in the rainy season (April to October). The most affected provinces are Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste.
* **Flash floods and severe landslides** occur in many parts of Costa Rica. Do not drive into water if you don’t know how deep it is.
* **Wildfires** commonly occur between January and the end of May. Affected areas include Guanacaste and the northern region but can affect other areas of the country. Follow guidance from Government of Costa Rica authorities on preventing wildfires and follow evacuation routes.
