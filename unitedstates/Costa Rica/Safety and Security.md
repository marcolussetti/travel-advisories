**Crime**

* Petty theft and pickpocketing are common crimes for U.S. travelers. More serious crimes, like sexual assault and murder, have also happened.
* Armed robbers often target smartphones, wallets, or purses. If someone with a weapon confronts you, don't resist.
* Never leave valuables unattended on the beach or in an unlocked room.
* Don't leave valuables in an unattended vehicle.
* Even a locked car in a parking area can be a target. Always check that car doors are locked, as thieves can block key fobs with jammers.
* Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, especially at night.
* Stay aware of your surroundings and keep valuables out of sight.
* People have reported robberies at isolated rental properties. Ensure your rental has good security and lock all doors and windows.

**Beach safety**

* Rip currents in Costa Rica are very dangerous. They are responsible for several drownings of U.S. tourists each year.
* **Most beaches do not have lifeguards or warnings about unsafe conditions.**

* Avoid alcohol while swimming.
* Do not walk alone or go into the water at night.

* Ask your hotel or host about beach safety before you go.
* All beaches in Costa Rica are open to the public. You should not leave valuables unattended while you go into the water.
* Double check that your car is locked. Thieves often use signal blockers to prevent your key fobs from working.

**Tourism**

The tourism industry is regulated, and rules are enforced.

* Inspections take place on a regular basis, but some tour operators are not registered.
* Dangerous areas or activities are not always marked with signs.
* Medical treatment is available, but traffic and road conditions can delay access to remote areas.

U. S. citizens should consider [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

[The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT)](https://www.visitcostarica.com/planning-your-trip/tour-guides-directory) has a list of [Certified Tour Guides](https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/planning-your-trip/tour-guides-directory).

ICT also has safety and security information in [these English and Spanish language pamphlets.](https://www.visitcostarica.com/es/costa-rica/more/publications/security-brochures)

**Adventure sports**Some tour operators may not follow international standards and best practices.

* Be careful when doing adventure activities such as hiking, rafting, zip lining, or sky diving.
* U. S. citizens have died in Costa Rica while doing adventure sports.
* Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport.
* The Ministry of Health maintains a list of approved [adventure sports operators](https://www.visitcostarica.com/planning-your-trip/other-activities?page=1).
* Do not do adventure sports alone.
* Always carry ID and let others know where you are.
* Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet.  Even popular rafting spots can become dangerous in flash floods.
* Carry a first aid kit and know where the nearest rescue center is.

To hike in national parks, you should:

* Use a certified tour operator. The [Costa Rican Tourist Institute (ICT)](https://www.ict.go.cr/en/) has information on [Certified Tour Guides](https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/planning-your-trip/tour-guides-directory).

**Demonstrations**Demonstrations are common in Costa Rica.

* Avoid areas where protests are happening.
* Check local news for updates and traffic information.

Weather and Natural Disasters

Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone.

* Three volcanoes have become more active:  Rincon de la Vieja, Turrialba, and Poas.  Eruptions from Turrialba can disrupt air traffic and cause breathing issues. Follow park service guidance and alerts about volcanic activity. Never try to climb or access an active volcano without permission.
* Tsunamis can happen after significant earthquakes.
* Flooding is common in the rainy season (April to October). The most affected provinces are Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste.
* Flash floods and severe landslides occur in many parts of Costa Rica. Do not drive into water if you don’t know how deep it is.
* Wildfires commonly occur between January and the end of May. Affected areas include Guanacaste and the northern region but can affect other areas of the country. Follow guidance from Government of Costa Rica authorities on preventing wildfires and follow evacuation routes.
