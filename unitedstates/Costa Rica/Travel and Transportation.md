The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) has an English and Spanish language pamphlet with [tips for safe driving in Costa Rica](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visitcostarica.com.mcas.ms%2Fpublications%2Fsafety-brochures%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567).

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Be careful when driving. Roads can be in poor condition. Roads can have unclear lane markings, narrow shoulders, and large potholes. Signs may not be very clear, and visibility at intersections may be blocked by vegetation or other obstacles.

* If you have car trouble or a flat tire, find a well-lit and busy location like a gas station to stop. Be careful of strangers offering help, especially in less populated areas.
* Main highways in cities are paved, but roads to beaches and rural areas might not be. Some places may only be accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle.
* Drive very carefully when crossing moving water, such as riverbeds. Even a small amount of water can make your vehicle unstable.
* During the rainy season, some roads may be blocked due to landslides. If you're staying outside urban areas, check with your hotel about road conditions.
* Try not to drive outside of urban areas at night.
* Expect traffic jams in and around San Jose.
* Motorcyclists may not follow road rules, often passing on the right or weaving through traffic. Buses and cars often stop suddenly.

**Bridges:** Bridges, even on heavily traveled roads, may be only a single lane. Rural roads sometimes lack bridges. Do not drive through water if you can't see its depth.

**Traffic Laws:** You must have a valid passport and a U.S. driver's license or an international driving permit.

* Fines for routine traffic violations can be over $500 USD.
* Traffic laws, including speed limits, are often ignored. Turn signals are rarely used, and pedestrians don't always have the right of way
* In the event of a traffic accident, do not move the vehicle. Both the traffic police and an insurance investigator must make accident reports before the vehicles can be moved. Drivers using rental cars should understand their company’s policy in the event of accidents. Rental companies may fine drivers for failing to file a report.
* There is a high fatality rate for pedestrians and those riding bicycles or motorcycles. In the event of a traffic fatality, a judge must arrive at the scene to pronounce a person dead, which could take several hours. Ongoing investigations may prevent you from leaving the country for months.

**Public Transportation:** Be aware of your surroundings when using public transport. Avoid showing expensive items, like jewelry, and keep your bags close. You are strongly advised to avoid public buses due to pickpocketing. Use only licensed taxis or well-known ride-sharing services. Never accept rides from unlicensed vehicles.

**Unpaid traffic tickets:**U.S.citizens have reported to the Embassy that car rental companies charge credit cards for unpaid tickets. The Embassy cannot help in such cases.
