**Road conditions and safety**Driving conditions vary across the country. Drive with extreme caution:

* Roads can have unclear lane markings, narrow shoulders, and large potholes.
* Signs may not be very clear.
* Visibility at intersections may be blocked by vegetation or other obstacles.
* If you have car trouble or a flat tire, find a well-lit and busy location like a gas station to stop. Be careful of strangers offering help, especially in less populated areas.
* Main highways in cities are paved. But roads to beaches and rural areas might not be.  Some places may only be accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle.
* Drive carefully when crossing moving water, such as riverbeds. Even a small amount of water can make your vehicle unstable.
* During the rainy season, some roads may be blocked due to landslides. If you're staying outside urban areas, check with your hotel about road conditions.
* Try not to drive outside of urban areas at night.
* Expect traffic jams in and around San Jose.
* Motorcyclists may not follow road rules, often passing on the right or weaving through traffic.
* Buses and cars often stop suddenly.

**Bridges**Bridges, even on heavily traveled roads, may be only a single lane.

* Rural roads sometimes lack bridges.
* Do not drive through water if you can't see its depth.

**Traffic laws**You must have a valid passport and a U.S. driver's license or an international driving permit.

* Fines for routine traffic violations can be over $500 USD.
* Traffic laws, including speed limits, are often ignored. Turn signals are rarely used, and pedestrians don't always have the right of way.
* In the event of a traffic accident, do not move the vehicle. Both the traffic police and an insurance investigator must make accident reports before the vehicles can be moved.
* Drivers using rental cars should understand their company’s policy in the event of accidents. Rental companies may fine drivers for failing to file a report.

There is a high fatality rate for pedestrians and those riding bicycles or motorcycles. In the event of a traffic fatality, a judge must arrive at the scene to pronounce a person dead. This could take several hours. Ongoing investigations may prevent you from leaving the country for months.

**Public transportation**Stay aware of your surroundings when using public transport.

* Avoid showing expensive items, like jewelry. Keep your bags close to you.
* You are strongly advised to avoid public buses due to pickpocketing.
* Use only licensed taxis or well-known ride-sharing services. Never accept rides from unlicensed vehicles.

**Unpaid traffic tickets**U.S. citizens have reported to the Embassy that car rental companies charge credit cards for unpaid tickets. The embassy cannot help in such cases.

**Aviation safety oversight**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
