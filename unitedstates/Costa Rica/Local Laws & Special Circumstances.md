# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You must follow local laws. If you break them, you could be deported, arrested, or put in jail. Some crimes can be prosecuted in the United States even if they happen abroad. Check our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website. If you want to start a business in Costa Rica, talk to local authorities about the permits you need. The Embassy has received reports of impostors impersonating police officers and asking for bribes. If this happens, do not argue. Write down the officer's name and any numbers on their uniform or car. Report the incident by calling “911.”

**Hallucinogens:** Ayahuasca, kambo, and other dangerous hallucinogens are sometimes offered to travelers as part of spiritual ceremonies or rituals. These substances are not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the United States. Exercise extreme caution if you choose to participate in a spiritual ceremony or ritual. U. S. citizens have been victims of sexual assault, serious injury, and theft while under the influence of these substances. Be aware that you may put your safety at risk if you take part in a ceremony that uses ayahuasca or other hallucinogens.

**Alcohol/Drugs:** Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. You can get heavy fines and jail time for having, using, or selling illegal drugs. Marijuana and marijuana-related products are illegal in Costa Rica.

**Prostitution/Sex Tourism:** Promoting or facilitating prostitution is illegal. Local laws on human trafficking and child exploitation have very harsh penalties, including fines and jail time.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask local authorities to notify the Embassy right away. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for more information. People accused of serious crimes can be held before trial. Because local prisons are crowded, courts may instead put you on home arrest. This means you cannot leave Costa Rica and must check in with judicial authorities. You have the right to a public defender and a translator for most hearings.

**Judicial Process:** Local court cases take longer than in the United States. Civil cases usually take more than five years to finish.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods may be illegal in Costa Rica. You could face fines and/or have to give up the goods when you arrive in the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Costa Rica has no legal restrictions on same-sex relations or LGB events. Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page. See section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for more.

**Travelers Who Need Accessibility Assistance:** Costa Rica has limited accessibility and accommodation. Many buildings are not accessible. The Costa Rican Ombudsman’s Office has received complaints about accessibility. There also are reports of broken wheelchair lifts on public transportation.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Residency:** U.S. citizens who want to live or stay long-term in Costa Rica should seek local legal guidance. A qualified attorney can advise you on the requirements for [legal residency](https://www.migracion.go.cr/Paginas/Categor%C3%ADa%20Migratorias%20(Extranjer%C3%ADa)/Personas-Extranjeras.aspx). U. S. citizens who misuse their tourist status to live in Costa Rica can be deported and can also be restricted from entering the country.

**Real Estate:** Be very cautious with real estate purchases or investments. Consult with reputable legal counsel and review the contract completely. The Embassy cannot assist you with land or business disputes; you must be prepared to take your case to the local courts. Civil records of land titles can be incomplete or contradictory. Coastal land within 50 meters of the high tide line is public space. This land is closed to development. The next 150 meters inland (“Maritime Zone”) cannot be owned by foreign nationals. Land in this zone is governed by the local municipality. The Costa Rican government has taken private land from some U.S. investors without enough or timely compensation. Property owners should keep their property secure. Squatter groups have taken over properties. They use laws that let them claim unused land. Victims have reported threats, harassment, and violence.

Check the [Embassy’s website](https://cr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/attorneys/) for a list of local lawyers.
