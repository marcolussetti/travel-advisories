# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal penalties**U.S. citizens must follow local laws.

* If you break laws, even by mistake, you could be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.
* You may be prosecuted in the U.S. for crimes committed abroad regardless of the local law.
* Learn more about examples of [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and information provided by the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/notice-us-citizens-your-actions-abroad-may-have-serious-consequences).
* If you want to start a business in Costa Rica, talk to local authorities about the permits you need.

The Embassy has received reports of impostors impersonating police officers and asking for money. If this happens, do not argue. Write down the officer's name and any numbers on their uniform or car. Report the incident by **dialing 911.**

**Hallucinogens**Ayahuasca, kambo, and other dangerous hallucinogens are sometimes offered to travelers as part of spiritual ceremonies or rituals.

* These substances are not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the United States.
* Exercise extreme caution if you choose to participate in a spiritual ceremony or ritual.
* U. S. citizens have been victims of sexual assault, serious injury, and theft while under the influence of these substances.

Be aware that you may put your safety at risk if you take part in a ceremony that uses ayahuasca or other hallucinogens.

**Alcohol and drugs**

* Drunk driving or while on drugs is illegal.
* You can get heavy fines and jail time for having, using, or selling illegal drugs.
* Marijuana and marijuana-related products are illegal in Costa Rica.

**Prostitution and sex tourism**Promoting or helping someone with prostitution is illegal.  Local laws on human trafficking and child exploitation have very harsh penalties, including fines and jail time.

**Arrest notification**If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask the police or prison officials to inform the [U.S. Embassy in the San Jose](https://cr.usembassy.gov/).

* People accused of serious crimes can be held before trial.
* Because local prisons are crowded, courts may instead put you on home arrest.  (You cannot leave Costa Rica and must check in with judicial authorities).

**Judicial process**Local court cases take longer than in the United States.  Civil cases usually take more than five years to finish.
