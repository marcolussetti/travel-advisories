# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:** U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport to enter Dominica. No visa is required for stays less than 6 months if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself. There is a departure tax of EC $86 (USD $33) assessed when leaving Dominica. Children under twelve years of age are exempt from the departure tax.  
  
Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Dominica, as well as proof of anticipated departure from Dominica. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Dominica on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.    
  
**HIV/AIDS:**

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Dominica.
