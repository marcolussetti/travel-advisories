Medical facilities in Dominica do not meet U.S. standards. Dominica has an operational hyperbaric chamber. There is limited ambulance service on most of the island. Sea rescue service is available at the North end of the island. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills for overseas travelers.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas.  
  
**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Dominica](https://dominica.gov.dm/) to ensure the medication is legal in Dominica. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
