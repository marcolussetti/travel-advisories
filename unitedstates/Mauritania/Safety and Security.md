# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Read the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Mauritania](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mauritania-travel-advisory.html) and [Worldwide Caution](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html) before planning travel to Mauritania.

**Terrorism:** The U.S. government assesses that a credible terrorist threat against foreigners remains in Mauritania. U.S. citizens in Mauritania should take precautions, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments.Travel in Mauritaniais discouraged, particularly in the easternmost region, due to activities by terrorist groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali.

**Traveling safely within Mauritania:** You should exercise prudence and caution when traveling in Mauritania. Be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas. The U.S. Embassy discourages travel outside of urban areas unless in a convoy accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions. Nighttime driving should be avoided. Travel at night between cities in Mauritania is prohibited for U.S. Embassy staff and all driving outside of the capital of Nouakchott requires a minimum two vehicle convoy. Landmines remain a danger along the border with the Western Sahara and travelers should cross only at designated border posts.

**Political concerns:** Protests and political rallies occur frequently in Mauritania, and can sometimes turn violent. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid political rallies and street demonstrations.

**Crime:** Criminal activity in Nouakchott continues to rise. A number of homes and private individuals, including U.S. citizens, have recently been targeted by violent criminals. In Nouakchott, armed robberies and burglaries are occurring at homes as well as on busy streets in broad daylight. Some of these incidents have been violent, and the use of knives and other weapons is becoming more common.

Because of the increase in criminal activity, U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times. U.S. citizens have been victims of assaults, including sexual assaults. Given the lack of government regulation of taxi fares and poor regular maintenance, U.S. citizens should avoid taxis and public transportation. U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from using public transportation and local taxi services.
