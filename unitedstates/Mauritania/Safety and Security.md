# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Read the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Mauritania](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mauritania-travel-advisory.html) and [Worldwide Caution](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html) before planning travel to Mauritania.

**Terrorism**:

Terrorist groups, and individuals inspired by them, with varying degrees of allegiance to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) operate in large parts of the Sahel and along the border with Mali. These groups remain active and may conduct attacks including the use of simpler methods like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds.

Travel is discouraged particularly in the easternmost region of Mauritania, due to activities by terrorist groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali.



* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Traveling safely within Mauritania:** You should exercise prudence and caution when traveling in Mauritania. Be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas. The U.S. Embassy discourages travel outside of urban areas unless in a convoy accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then, only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions. Nighttime driving should be avoided. Travel at night between cities in Mauritania is prohibited for U.S. Embassy staff and all driving outside of the capital of Nouakchott requires a minimum two vehicle convoy. Landmines remain a danger along the border with the Western Sahara and travelers should cross only at designated border posts.

**Political concerns:** Protests and political rallies occur regularly in Mauritania and can sometimes turn violent. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid political rallies and street demonstrations.

**Crime:** Opportunistic crime is prevalent in Mauritania. Several homes and private individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been targeted by violent criminals within the past five years. In Nouakchott, rape, armed robberies and burglaries occur at homes and busy streets in broad daylight. Some of these incidents have been violent, and the use of knives and other weapons is becoming more common.

U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times. U.S. citizens have been victims of assaults, including sexual assaults. Given the lack of government regulation of taxi fares and poor regular maintenance, U.S. citizens should avoid taxis and public transportation. U.S. Embassy staff and their family members are prohibited from using public transportation and local taxi services.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Mauritania. Review [the Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI pages](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) for information

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.
