# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** While traveling in Mauritania, you are subject to its laws even if you are a U.S. citizen. If you break local laws in Mauritania, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution. It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not where you are going.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

**Religious norms:** Islamic ideals and beliefs in Mauritania encourage conservative dress and behavior. Mauritania recognizes Islam as the sole religion of its citizens and the state. Religious freedom is restricted and affronts against Islamic modesty and morals carry penalties such as fines. Participation in Christian gatherings and activities that have not been authorized by the Mauritanian government is illegal. Proselytizing in Mauritania is illegal and may lead to deportation, arrest, prosecution, or incarceration.

**Importation of alcohol and pork:** Passengers caught attempting to bring alcoholic drinks or pork products into Nouakchott International Airport, including alcohol bought duty free on an inbound flight, may be subject to immediate fines, confiscation, and/or incarceration.

**Local currency:** The local currency is the ouguiya, and it may not be imported or exported. Credit cards can be used only at a few hotels in the capital, Nouakchott, and in the northwestern city of Nouadhibou. However, travelers are strongly advised to pay hotel bills in cash. ATMs are available in Nouakchott and other large cities but are also not secure.

**Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Travelers:** There are no laws that protect persons from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Under Mauritanian law, consensual same-sex sexual activity between men is criminalized and may be punishable by death, though the government has not enforced the death penalty in recent years. Consensual, same-sex sexual conduct between women is punishable by three months to two years in prison and a monetary fine. Other laws may be used to target persons based on real or perceived sexual orientation.

**Travelers With Disabilities:**While in Mauritania, individuals with disabilities will find accessibility and accommodation very limited. There are very few sidewalks or paved roads, and few buildings are wheelchair accessible.
