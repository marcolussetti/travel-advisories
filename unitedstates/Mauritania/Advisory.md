***Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.***

Reconsider travel to Mauritania due to **crime** and **terrorism**.  Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Do Not Travel To:

* Areas designated as off limits by the Mauritanian military due to **crime** and **terrorism**.

**Country Summary:** Violent crimes, such as mugging, armed robbery, and assault, are common. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crimes.

Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting places frequented by Westerners.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Mauritania as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside Nouakchott. U.S. government employees may travel only during daylight hours and are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times.

**Areas Designated Off-Limits by the Mauritanian Military – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These “No Movement Zones” are extremely dangerous due to their proximity to Mali, where armed groups engaged in an active insurgency carry out cross-border attacks into Mauritania. The government of Mauritania does not maintain a substantial presence in these areas and thus police are unable to respond to most incidents there. In addition, cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places. Since the boundaries of such areas frequently change, U.S. citizens should pay attention to all posted signs and notices of restricted entry. They should presume the following areas are off-limits:

* All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer
* All areas east of 08⁰ longitude (West of Greenwich) situated within 100km of the Mali Border
