Reconsider travel to Mauritania due to **terrorism** and **crime**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Do Not Travel To:

* Areas marked off-limits by the Mauritanian military. These areas are unsafe due to security risks and terrorist activities.
* All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer
* All areas within 100 KM of the Mali and Algeria Border

**Country Summary:** Violent crimes occur frequently outside the Tevragh Zeina neighborhoods in Nouakchott. They include mugging, armed robbery, and assault. Local police lack the resources to respond quickly and effectively to serious crimes. Transportation options and communication infrastructure are limited outside Nouakchott. little or no warning, targeting places frequented by Westerners.

**Terrorism**

Terrorist violence is a risk in Mauritania. This includes potential attacks and other activities. Visit the U.S. Department of State's country [reports on terrorism to learn more.](https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/mauritania#:~:text=Overview%3A%20Mauritania%20remained%20an%20excellent,on%20its%20soil%20since%202011.)

**U.S. Travel Limits and Emergency Services**

The U.S. government can only offer limited emergency services to U.S. citizens in Mauritania. This is due to travel rules for U.S. government employees, poor infrastructure, and few health facilities, especially outside of Nouakchott.

U.S. government employees can travel outside Nouakchott only during the day. They cannot walk alone outside of specific areas and times. U.S. government employees must get special permission to travel outside Nouakchott. This helps them move smoothly through security checkpoints on major roads.

**Areas Designated Off-Limits by the Mauritanian Military – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These “No Movement Zones” are very dangerous. They are near Mali, where armed groups are fighting an active insurgency. This violence may spill over the border into Mauritania. The government of Mauritania has little presence in these areas. Police cannot respond to most incidents.

Cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent in these areas. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places. The boundaries of these areas often change, so stay informed about restricted entry.
