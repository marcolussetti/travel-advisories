On August 31, 2021, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan suspended all operations. Please read the [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/afghanistan-advisory.html) for Afghanistan, which advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan for any reason due to terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping and crime, and advises U.S. citizens currently in Afghanistan to depart immediately via commercial means if possible.

U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to [AfghanistanACS@state.gov](mailto:AfghanistanACS@state.gov).

**Passport and Visas:**U.S. citizens must have a valid passport and Afghan visa to enter and exit Afghanistan. Travelers arriving without a valid visa are subject to deportation, confiscation of their passport, heavy fines, or detention.

**Dual Nationals/Afghan Heritage:**U.S. citizens born in Afghanistan of Afghan parentage are considered to be Afghan nationals and are not required to have an entry visa. U.S. citizens of Afghan parentage who were not born in Afghanistan must have a visa to enter Afghanistan.

**Registration:**Foreigners arriving in Afghanistan are fingerprinted during the immigration process. Foreign passengers arriving at the Kabul International Airport are expected to register with a representative of the Ministry of Interior’s Foreigners’ Registration Office.
