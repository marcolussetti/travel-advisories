For emergency services in Afghanistan, dial 119 or 100 for police; 102 for medical assistance; 112 for fire.

Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not present throughout the country
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities vary in quality and range of services and are generally below U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often require cash prepayment for services. Western-style private clinics can be found in Kabul offering a variety of basic emergency and routine preventative-type care, but their hours are limited, and such facilities may not be suitable for complex trauma cases or severe medical emergencies. Individuals without licenses or medical degrees sometimes operate private clinics, and there is no public agency that monitors their operations.

Travelers are strongly urged to obtain sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications prior to arrival. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available in Afghanistan. Travelers should be aware that many pharmaceuticals found in Afghanistan are counterfeits, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven.

The U.S. government does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Afghanistan.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:**In many areas of Afghanistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan will cover you outside of the United States, and that it specifically covers care when you are in Afghanistan. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Many insurance companies consider Afghanistan to be an active warzone and specifically exclude coverage for individuals residing or traveling there.

U.S. citizens are strongly recommended to obtain [supplemental medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) as medical transport out of Afghanistan can be prohibitively expensive. When selecting a medical evacuation provider, be sure to confirm that the company offers such services in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as a medical evacuation point. Please note that the U.S. governmentcannot pay your medical bills.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
