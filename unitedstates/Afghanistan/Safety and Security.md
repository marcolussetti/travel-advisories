# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to go to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Decades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Violent extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Local security forces, buildings housing ministries and other public sector institutions, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale terror attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential compound or hotel’s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack.

**Kidnapping/Hostage Taking/Wrongful Detention**: Violent extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity. Additionally, the threat of wrongful detention remains high as U.S. citizens have been detained and held for indefinite periods in Afghanistan under unclear or unjust circumstances.

**Demonstrations and Riots**: U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks.

**Property/Business Disputes:** Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes. Some have involved threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping, and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. government will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early in the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen in their absence, is recommended.

**Communications:** Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device.

**Crime:** Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. Embassy Kabul suspended operations on August 31, 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, including victims of crime.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in Afghanistan. The local equivalent to the U.S. “911” emergency line is “119” in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States.

Travelers should not expect or rely on significant assistance from local authorities in Afghanistan in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true for U.S.-based companies and their employees seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property may be seized, and personnel may be detained as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes.

**Tourism:** No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response services and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are very limited in-Afghanistan and may be entirely unavailable outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance that covers medical evacuation from Afghanistan.
