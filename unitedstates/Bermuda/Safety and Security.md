**Crime:** By comparison to the United States, Bermuda has a low to moderate crime rate. Recent crime statistics are available at the official website of the [Bermuda Police Service](http://www.bermudapolice.bm/). Valuables left unattended in public areas, in unsecured hotel rooms, or on rental motorbikes are vulnerable to theft. Criminals have been known to target visitors on motorbikes and at popular tourist attractions, and purse snatchings, perpetrated by thieves riding motorbikes, and muggings have occurred in the past. The back streets of the City of Hamilton have been the setting for assaults, particularly at night after the bars close.

Travelers should exercise caution when walking after dark or visiting out-of-the-way places on the island as they can be vulnerable to theft and assault, and because narrow and dark roadways can contribute to accidents.

Travelers should note the presence of gangs and illegal drug activity in Bermuda. There have been no reports of gang violence targeted towards visitors to Bermuda, although gang-related shooting incidents have occurred and continue to occur throughout the island.

**Beach Safety:** Swimming areas at some popular beaches around Bermuda can have dangerous rip currents, and swimming in the ocean is not the same as swimming in a pool or lake. Wind, waves, the change of the tide, the slope of the beach, and other factors can cause strong currents and difficult swimming conditions to be present in the water even on the calmest days. U.S. citizens have drowned in Bermuda due to these conditions. Only swim when there is a lifeguard present and always remain in sight of them. Do not dive into water of unknown depth. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming.  For more information, please visit [Beach and Ocean Safety | American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/water-safety/beach-safety.html).

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regards to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
