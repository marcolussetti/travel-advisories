**Road Conditions and Safety:**  Driving on the island is on the left, British-style, and the maximum speed limit is 15 mph in Hamilton and 21 mph on the rest of the island. Under Bermudian law, non-residents are not allowed to own, rent, or drive four-wheeled vehicles, except for a limited number of all electric rental mini cars that hold two passengers. Non-residents must rely on taxis, buses, or rental scooters.

**Traffic Laws:**  Traffic accidents involving motorbikes are common in Bermuda.  Any U.S. citizen visiting Bermuda who chooses to rent a motorbike or electric mini car should exercise extreme caution on the roadways as road conditions and local driving practices unfamiliar to U.S. drivers could increase the chances of mishap or injury.

**Public Transportation:**  There is a regular, island-wide public bus and ferry service, and daily and weekly passes are available at the central bus terminal, or Visitors’ Service Bureau or ferry terminal in Hamilton. Bus schedules can be viewed [here](https://www.gov.bm/bus), and ferry schedules can be viewed [here](http://www.marineandports.bm/).

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Bermuda’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Bermuda’s air carrier operations.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Bermuda should check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
