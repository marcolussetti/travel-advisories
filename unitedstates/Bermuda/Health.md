For emergency services in Bermuda, dial 911.

* Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Bermuda.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

The U.S. Consulate maintains a list of [doctors and hospitals](https://bm.usconsulate.gov/medical-information/?_ga=2.225168154.1065066930.1701179056-1169241530.1701179056). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:** Adequate medical care is available for routine procedures, though extremely expensive. The only hospital in Bermuda performs general surgery and has an emergency room and intensive care unit. Serious or complex medical programs will likely require medical evacuation to the United States. Most Bermudian health care providers including the local hospital do not accept overseas insurance and will expect payment at the time of service.

**Pharmaceuticals:** U.S. prescriptions are not honored in Bermuda.  It will be necessary to visit a Bermuda doctor and have a new prescription written if you need to have it filled in Bermuda. Most common medications are available locally upon presentation of a prescription from a Bermuda doctor.  If you are taking prescription medication, you must inform Bermuda customs officials at the point of entry. Medicines must be in labeled containers, and travelers should carry a copy of the written prescription and a letter from the physician or pharmacist confirming the reason the medicine is prescribed.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://www.gov.bm/ministry/health) to ensure the medication is legal in Bermuda.
