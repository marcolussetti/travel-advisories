# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws.  If you violate Bermuda’s laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Bermuda Customs routinely boards visiting cruise ships with drug sniffing dogs and will arrest persons found to have any illegal drugs in their cabin. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Bermuda are severe, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and/or heavy fines. Having a prescription for marijuana or any other drug currently illegal in Bermuda will not protect you from arrest or prosecution for possession of that illegal drug.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately.  See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** The Department of State warns United States citizens against taking any type of firearm, ammunition or component of a firearm into Bermuda. The Bermuda government strictly enforces its laws restricting the entry of weapons and ammunition. Entering Bermuda with a firearm, some bladed instruments, an ammunition magazine, or even a single round of ammunition is illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into the country unintentionally. Permission to import or own a gun in Bermuda must be sought in advance from the [Bermuda Police Service](http://www.bermudapolice.bm/). Any privately owned firearms must be secured at Bermuda Police Headquarters. Violations may result in arrest, convictions, and potentially long prison sentences. Pepper sprays and stun guns are considered dangerous weapons in Bermuda and are illegal.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Don’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Bermuda.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is available in the United States. Bermuda does not currently have legislation on access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. Very few hotels would be considered fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We recommend you always check with the hotel or property where you will be staying to see if their dimensions for rooms, doors, and bathrooms are ADA-compliant. Outside of the City of Hamilton, sidewalks are generally unavailable or not suitable for wheelchairs. Public ferries are handicap accessible, as are some of the public buses, but most bus stops are not. Handicap accessible taxis are available for hire in Bermuda.
