***Updated to reflect a new separate travel advisory from the Kingdom of Denmark.***

Exercise increased caution in Greenland due to **environmental hazards posed by extreme weather conditions**and**limited emergency services.**

**Country Summary:**The U.S. government’s ability to provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Greenland is extremely limited.

Greenland’s landscape includes vast stretches of territory remote from cities and settlements. The weather can be harsh, and resources to provide emergency services in areas distant from cities and large settlements, including search and rescue, are scarce. In some areas, search and rescue efforts could take several days to reach the site of an incident.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Greenland.html) for additional information on travel to Greenland.

If you decide to travel to Greenland:

* Obtain comprehensive travel, medical, and evacuation insurance; see our webpage for more [information on insurance coverage abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
* Travel with a professional guide or organization, such as those that are a member of the [Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators](https://aeco.no/), or, if organizing a private expedition, be self-sufficient.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive security messages and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html).
* Understand Greenland is a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland has assumed responsibility for the administration of health, education, taxation, and family and social matters (among other competencies), meaning these matters are handled differently than in Denmark.
* Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov) and [X/Twitter](https://x.com/travelgov).
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/greenland) related to your travel.
