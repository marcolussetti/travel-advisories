# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you could be deported, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are strict, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence can result in loss of your driver’s license and immediate detention in jail.

**Removal of Natural Resources:** Greenland has strict regulations on the extraction of natural resources, including all precious and semi-precious metals, stones, and gemstones. Check with local authorities before attempting to extract or export any of these materials.

**Products Derived from Mammals:** Many Greenlandic handicrafts and souvenirs are derived from mammals in the Arctic region. Generally, you may not import items such as polar bear and seal skins or products made from whale bones into the United States. For more information, see CBP’s article on [importing endangered species](https://www.helpspanish.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1020) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s [guide for travelers](https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FW-1019-A-Guide-for-Travelers-Buy-Informed.pdf).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex relations or the organization of LGB events in Greenland.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Greenland prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities for employment, education, and access to health care or other government services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, older lodging, and older infrastructure.

For addition information, please visit [Tilioq’s website](https://www.tilioq.gl/en/). Tilioq is a Greenlandic government organization that promotes full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Greenland.
