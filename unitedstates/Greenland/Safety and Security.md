# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Police Assistance:** Call +299 70 14 48 for police assistance.

**Environmental Hazards:**

* Greenland’s landscape includes vast stretches of territory remote from cities and settlements.
* Long periods of daylight and darkness, extreme cold, strong winds, and rapidly changing weather are common.
* Common threats include frostbite, dehydration, keratitis (eye damage from reflected sunlight), sunburn, and accidents.
* Emergency response capabilities, including search and rescue, are limited due to resource constraints, long distances, and natural hazards.  In areas outside of cities and large settlements, search and rescue efforts could take several days to reach the scene of an incident.

**Cruise Ship Travel**: If you are considering cruise ship travel to or around Greenland, you should:

* Understand search and rescue capabilities are limited.
* Be aware advanced medical care is not available in many areas of Greenland where cruise ships travel.  Cruise ships must coordinate with the Greenlandic Healthcare System to disembark passengers in need of medical attention in towns with medical facilities capable of treating the passenger.
* When choosing cruises off the coast of Greenland, check the operational records and the experience of captains and crews operating ships in Arctic waters.
* Follow the safety guidelines, advice, and instructions of your cruise operator.

**Search and Rescue:** Search and rescue capabilities in Greenland are limited, distances are vast, and the weather is harsh.   In some areas outside of cities and large settlements, first responders could take several days to reach the scene of an incident. Upon arrival, they may only be able to provide basic medical care and transportation to more advanced facilities.  In addition, the person in need of assistance will be billed for the cost of search and rescue efforts.  Travelers should obtain comprehensive travel, medical, and evacuation insurance prior to departure. See our webpage for more [information on insurance coverage abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Overland Travel and Hiking:**  Greenland’s landscape includes vast stretches of territory remote from cities and settlements.  The winter has periods of prolonged darkness, and the summer has periods of prolonged daylight.  Extreme cold, strong winds, and rapidly changing weather are common.

* Use only experienced guides, prepare a detailed itinerary, and inform the relevant authorities and your emergency contacts of your plans.
* Consider bringing a satellite phone, satellite personal locator beacon, and VHF radio.
* Understand the risks of glaciers, crevasses, polar bears, landslides, avalanches, and tsunamis.
* Permits are required for travel to Greenland’s Northeast National Park, treks across the ice sheet, and travel to isolated regions of Greenland.  Check the Expedition Office’s [website](https://exp.gl/) and [map](https://exp.gl/media/b5b84110-343b-4ba2-a432-786ced360fd0/PEWFYQ/map-large.png) of the areas of Greenland that require permits and instructions to obtain them.
* If you are unfamiliar with an area, you can easily become disoriented and risk prolonged, unplanned exposure to the elements.
* Greenland’s mountains are moderately high but technically difficult.  Familiarize yourself with ascent and descent routes.
* Local authorities will try to rescue people in distress, but search and rescue resources are limited.  Outside of cities and large settlements, it might take several days for local authorities to reach you.
* For more information on travel to Greenland, please review [Visit Greenland’s website](https://visitgreenland.com/).

**Polar Bears:**  Polar bears are active in many regions of Greenland and are extremely dangerous. Avoid any behavior that could provoke an attack. If you encounter a polar bear:

* Do not approach the bear; instead, leave the area and seek shelter.
* If you cannot leave the area safely, use a deterrent, such as making noise, jumping, waving your arms, and throwing things, to scare the bear away.
* Inform local authorities about the location of the bear sighting.

If you choose to travel in areas of Greenland frequented by polar bears, you should read Visit Greenland’s [polar bear guide for hikers](https://visitgreenland.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Infographic-Encountering-polar-bear-while-hiking-in-Greenland-by-Visit-Greenland.pdf), the Greenlandic government’s [polar bear guidelines](https://visitgreenland.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Final-Guidelines-for-encounters-with-polar-bears.pdf), and the International Polar Guides Association’s [polar bear safety recommendations](https://polarguides.org/uploads/general/recommendations/IPGA-Polar-Bear-Safety-Recommendations.pdf).

**Seals:** Six species of seals are common in Greenland. Seals are usually nonaggressive, playful, and curious. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends observing seals from distance of at least 150 feet. If you unexpectedly encounter a seal, remain calm, back away slowly, and avoid sudden movements. Never put your hand out to a seal. Seals carry several types of bacteria that are harmful to humans. If your skin is broken by a seal, you should seek medical attention immediately as you could contract [seal finger](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/alaska-science-forum/seal-finger), which can have lifelong implications.

**Muskoxen:**Muskoxen can weigh up to 850 pounds and are found in many parts of Greenland. Do not provoke or approach musk oxen. They are powerful animals and can become defensive if they feel threatened. For more information, see the Alaska Department of Game and Fisheries’ guide about [living with muskoxen](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=livewith.muskoxen).

**Tsunamis:** Landslides, icebergs, and glaciers can trigger tsunami-like waves with little warning and have caused loss of life, injury, and extensive damage to infrastructure. As icebergs melt, their center of gravity shifts, causing them to tip over and break. Glaciers that calve icebergs into fjords can also trigger tsunamis. You should:

* Be vigilant and comply with all signs and warnings when visiting coastal areas.
* Keep a safe distance from icebergs if you are in a boat or kayak.
* Understand that visiting a glacier’s ablation zone is extremely hazardous.  Exercise extreme caution and maintain a safe distance, especially if visiting this area by boat.

**Crevasses:** Glaciers are constantly moving, causing crevasses to form, especially within the top 150 feet where the ice is brittle. Crevasses can be difficult to see and are often covered by thin layers of snow. These snow bridges can be only a few inches thick and will not support the weight of a person or vehicle. New crevasses can open at any time, and you should not assume a previously traversed route is safe. Crossing a glacier is extremely risky, if you choose to travel on a glacier, you should:

* Hire an experienced guide.
* Travel with a team.
* Use proper equipment and purchase appropriate clothing.
* Read the U.S. Antarctic Program’s [Glacier and Crevasse Traverse Manual](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/ail/reading_docs/science/Glacier-Crevasse%20Rescue%20Manual_2019%5b26%5d.pdf) and [Field Manual on Glacier Travel and Crevasse Rescue](http://www.usap.gov/travelanddeployment/documents/FieldManual-Chapt18GlacierTravelandCrevasse.pdf).

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections of equipment and facilities are not common. Hazardous areas/activities are not always signposted, and staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities in the field. In the event of injury, adequate medical treatment is usually only available in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
