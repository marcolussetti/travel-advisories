**Health Facilities:** All health care in Greenland is public; there are no private medical providers or facilities. Public facilities are limited, and medical evacuation is required for serious illness or injury. Many professional staff will speak English; however, you should anticipate an English-speaking medical professional might not be available, especially in smaller settlements. Please refer to the Greenlandic Healthcare System’s [list of health centers](https://peqqik.gl/Kontakt/Sundhedscentre).

* Medical facilities and equipment are limited outside of Nuuk. Larger towns have small hospitals with a few doctors. Smaller towns often have medical clinics staffed by a single doctor. The majority of smaller settlements have a community member with basic medical training. In the event of an emergency, this person will coordinate further medical treatment.
* Greenland has four small regional hospitals in Aasiaat, Ilulissat, Sisimiut, and Qaqortoq, and a national hospital in Nuuk.
* As a tourist, you or your insurance company must pay for all health care and medical-related transportation in Greenland and home from Greenland. The U.S. government does not guarantee payment or pay for medical expenses.
* There is a private dentist in Nuuk able to assist tourists requiring emergency dental care.
* Medical evacuation is required for serious illness or injury
  + The Greenlandic Healthcare System has one air ambulance, a “King Air” with room for two stretchers, which is used to transport patients throughout Greenland. It is often in use and may not be available for immediate evacuation. If the “King Air” is not available, transport by helicopter or Dash 8 is an alternative, provided Air Greenland has an aircraft available.
  + Kangerlussuaq and Narsarsuaq are the only airports in Greenland that can accommodate ambulance jets. There are no hospitals in these locations, and close coordination with the Greenlandic Healthcare System is required to transfer patients to ambulance jets.
  + The Greenlandic Healthcare System can assist with transportation within Greenland or transportation to a hospital in Copenhagen with a payment guarantee.
* You must contact the Greenlandic Healthcare System prior to seeking treatment for a non-life-threatening emergency. If you appear at an emergency room unannounced for a non-life-threatening emergency, you may be turned away.

**Ambulance Service:** Ambulance service is limited in Greenland and only available in larger towns. Greenland has no established road system between towns and settlements.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors abroad do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance coverage abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html"). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel abroad.

**Evacuation Insurance:** The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation from Greenland. Medical evacuation is required for serious illnesses or injuries in Greenland and is costly.

**Adventure Travel:** Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).

**Prescription Medication:** Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Prescription medication can normally only be obtained at one of the four regional hospitals or at Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in Nuuk, and not all medications available in the United States are available in Greenland. If you unexpectedly need to fill a prescription in Greenland, you will need a prescription from a doctor in Greenland. Review the Greenlandic Healthcare System’s [information about importing medicine and list of authorized medication](https://peqqik.gl/Emner/Medicin/Udlevering-indfoersel-lovelige-laegemid).

**Over-the-Counter Medication:** A limited selection of over-the-counter medication is available in grocery stores.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-vaccines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
