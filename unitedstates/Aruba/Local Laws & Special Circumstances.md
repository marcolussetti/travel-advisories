# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

Aruba’s enforcement policy concerning drug possession differs significantly from the Netherlands. In Aruba, laws against possession of controlled substances are enforced rigorously, including against tourists in possession of marijuana for personal use.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

Local law is based on Dutch law, which allows for the detention of subjects during an investigation with the approval of a judge. People detained in Aruba do not have the option of posting bond for their release.

**Dual Nationality:** Dutch law, in principle, does not permit dual nationality. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For detailed information, contact the [The Netherlands Embassy](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/contact/embassies-consulates-general/united-states/embassy-washington-dc) in Washington, DC, or one of the [Dutch Consulates](https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/your-country-and-the-netherlands/united-states) in the United States.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Aruba.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** While in Aruba, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different than in the United States. Sidewalks and crossings in many areas are not wheelchair accessible, and many buildings lack ramps.

The law in the Dutch Caribbean prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access.  However, accessibility may be limited in some lodgings and general infrastructure.
