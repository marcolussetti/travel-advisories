Access to quality medical care is limited in Aruba, and facilities may not offer the health and service standards typically expected in the United States.

There is no decompression chamber in Aruba. Persons suffering from decompression sickness must be medically evacuated for proper treatment.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

A [list of medical facilities](https://cw.usconsulate.gov/medical-assistance/) in Aruba is available on our Consulate website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance and overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Critically ill patients requiring services unavailable in Aruba are transferred to neighboring countries, such as Colombia, at the patient’s expense. If medical evacuation is authorized by the patient’s insurance carrier or funded privately (approximately $15,000 – 25,000), patients can be transferred to the United States.

**Medicines**

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [Aruba](https://www.visitaruba.com/government)to ensure the medication is legal in Aruba. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

The variety of drugs available locally is smaller than in the U.S., and you may not be able to find all of your medications in Aruba. For most medicines, you will need a local prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The following diseases are prevalent:

* [Zika Virus](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html)
* [Dengue](http://www.cdc.gov/Dengue/)
* [Chikungunya](http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/)

Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/resources-for-travelers) regarding specific issues in Aruba.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Aruba.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
