# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Crime against tourists consists primarily of theft. The main targets are valuables left unattended in public areas (beaches, cars, hotel lobbies, etc.). Purses, cameras, passports, phones, and other handheld electronics are the most frequently stolen items. Take normal precautions to secure personal property. Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Keep a copy of your U.S. passport in a secure location in case the original is lost or stolen.

* Incidents of violent crime, including rape and armed robbery – although not common – do occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island.
* There is an increased risk of crime in the San Nicolas district, especially at night. Crimes against tourists are more common here.
* Car theft, especially of rental vehicles, can occur. Vehicle leases and rentals may not be fully covered by local insurance when a vehicle is stolen or damaged. Be sure you are sufficiently insured when renting any item.
* The legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate. Take standard safety precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars. Travel in pairs or groups, and, if you consume alcohol, do so responsibly. To avoid spiked drinks, do not leave your drink unattended or accept open containers from strangers.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Consulate for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 100.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, basic emergency medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. Critical injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
