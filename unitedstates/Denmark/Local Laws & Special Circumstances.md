# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws. If you violate them, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some crimes may be prosecuted in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice web page on extraterritorial crimes](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [web page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict; convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Driving under the influence may lead to confiscation of your driver’s license and immediate detention.
* Possession of weapons of any kind, including pocketknives and pepper spray, may result in criminal penalties.
* Your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution if you break the law in the Kingdom of Denmark.

**Danish Compulsory Military Service:** All male citizens 18 years of age and resident in Denmark must participate in a military draft.   Conscription periods vary from four to 12 months, based on the section of the armed forces to which you are assigned.

* Danish law mandates access to buildings, education, information, and communications for persons with disabilities.
* Public transportation can accommodate persons with disabilities, but many buildings and outdoor sites are not easily accessible for the disabled.
