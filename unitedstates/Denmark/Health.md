Excellent medical facilities are widely available in Denmark. Hospitals are modern, fully equipped, and most professional staff will speak English. Medical facilities in the Faroe Islands are generally well equipped, though more complex procedures could require evacuation to Denmark.

For life-threatening emergencies in Denmark and the Faroe Islands, dial 112.

* For non-life-threatening emergencies, you can call a medical helpline, staffed by English-speaking physicians and nurses, who will coordinate an appointment for you at an emergency room or health clinic. In greater Copenhagen, you can call 1813. In other regions of Denmark, consult the table below. If you appear at an emergency room with a non-life-threatening emergency without calling in advance, you could be turned away.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply abroad.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage abroad. Most care providers abroad only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for coverage abroad. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel abroad.

**Medical Evacuation:** We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription Medication:** If traveling with prescription medication, review the [https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/pharmacies/medicines-imported-from-abroad/](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flaegemiddelstyrelsen.dk%2Fen%2Fpharmacies%2Fmedicines-imported-from-abroad%2F&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C3c97b5026af04fd5ee9508dd6ae9736e%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638784273070868171%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=99s5mdVUC68eu4ChgWvsOpq0qjx3TXFKzlJncr5WhGc%3D&reserved=0)  to confirm the medication is legal in the Kingdom of Denmark.   Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Denmark.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
