# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack—including knives, firearms, and vehicles—to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship and associated institutions
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Organized crime groups operate in Denmark, including in and around Copenhagen. Travelers should be aware of their surroundings and immediately leave the area if they feel threatened. In response to crime, Danish police may establish “Search Zones” to stop and search individuals at random.

**Pickpockets** and **purse-snatchers** operate aggressively in areas frequented by tourists, on trains and buses, and at transit stations, including Copenhagen Central Station, Copenhagen Airport, and quays. Do not place any bags containing valuables, such as your passport or credit cards, on the ground or on the back of a chair in public places, such as restaurants, bars, and cafes. Monitor your personal electronics, which are particularly attractive to thieves. Review the [OSAC Crime and Safety Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/4fbcbb05-5b6b-4c1d-a49d-15f4aeb7913b) for more information on crime in Denmark.

When traveling or living in the Kingdom of Denmark, you should:

* Exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations.
* If stopped by the police, cooperate and be ready to present identification.

**Demonstrations** occur regularly in Denmark. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on holidays, or during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Large public gatherings can affect public and private transportation.
* Monitor local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules regarding best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to arrive and stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
