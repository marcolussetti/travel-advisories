# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Denmark is a party to the [Schengen Agreement](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).

* **We recommend your passport be valid for at least six months at the time of your entry into the Schengen area.** We recommend six months because your passport must be valid for at least three months after the date you intend to leave the Schengen area, and immigration authorities may admit you for a period of up to three months. For additional information about travel into and within Schengen countries, please see our [Schengen fact sheet](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html) and the [EU’s page on Travel Documents for non-EU Nationals.](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm)
* **You may enter Denmark for up to 90 days for tourism without a visa, regardless of whether you have stayed in another Schengen country before your entry into Denmark.** Review the [Danish Immigration Service’s page on Visa-Free Travel](https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Short-stay-visa/Visa-free-visits) for more information.
* If you are a **student or prospective student**, your student visa will allow you to stay in Denmark for the standard duration of your educational program.
