# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:** U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport at time of entry.  
  
**NOTE:** Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Montserrat, as well as proof of anticipated departure from the island. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Montserrat on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.  
  
**HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Montserrat.
