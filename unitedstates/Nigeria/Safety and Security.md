# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Please see our most recent [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/nigeria-travel-advisory.html) for more details.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime**: Muggings, assaults, burglaries, car-jackings, rape, kidnappings, and extortion occur regularly. Law enforcement authorities usually respond slowly and often do not have the resources to provide investigative support to victims.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens beyond Abuja and Lagos and their immediate surrounding areas. U.S. government employees may be subject to travel constraints as security conditions warrant.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams**:  See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Nigeria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Inheritance notices
* [Nigerian Letter or “419” Fraud](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/nigerian-letter-or-419-fraud)

**Victims of Crime**:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Abuja or Consulate General in Lagos for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112, and contact the Embassy at +(234)(9)461-4328 or Consulate General at +(234)(1) 460-3400. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Justice in Nigeria may be uneven. Many crimes go unsolved. Others may not be prosecuted to a successful conclusion for the victim.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. citizen victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.

* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Provide information on [victims’ compensation programs in the United States](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).
* Provide information on victims’ assistance programs in Nigeria:
* National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons ([NAPTIP](https://www.naptip.gov.ng/))
* Women Trafficking and Child Labor Eradication Foundation ([WOTCLEF](https://wotclef.org.ng/index.aspx))
* Women at Risk International Foundation ([WARIF](http://warifng.org/))
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Even within major cities, the limited number of first responders and extreme traffic congestion can cause lengthy delays in response time. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. You should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment for serious conditions.  U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Maritime Security**: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.
