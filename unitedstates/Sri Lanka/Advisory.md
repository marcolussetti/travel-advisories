Exercise increased caution in Sri Lanka due to **civil unrest** and **terrorism.**

**Country Summary:** Protests over the economic and political situation in Sri Lanka can erupt at any time.  In some instances, police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters. U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, that could turn violent with little or no warning.

Terrorist attacks have occurred in Sri Lanka, with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote areas.
