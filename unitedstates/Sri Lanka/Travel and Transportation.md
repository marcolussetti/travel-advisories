**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States. Vehicular traffic in Sri Lanka moves on the left (British style). Traffic in Colombo can be congested with narrow two-lane highways. Roads are often crowded with trucks, buses that are not driven well, and many other types of vehicles. You might see ox carts, bicycles, and newer four-wheel-drive cars all sharing the same road. Unexpected roadblocks and one-way streets are common and may not be clearly marked. Many visitors hire cars and drivers for longer trips. If you decide to hire a “tuk-tuk” or similar three-wheeled vehicle, make sure to use one with a meter or agree on the price before the ride. This will help you avoid problems when you reach your destination. If you are renting a vehicle, you should specifically request one with working seatbelts.

Heavy rain sometimes causes flooding, which can make roads inaccessible for several days and increase the risk of landslides.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting you around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. The GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Public Transportation:**The Embassy does not recommend using public buses due to safety concerns.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information. Visit the website of Sri Lanka’s [national tourist office](https://www.srilanka.travel/) and national authority responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Sri Lanka’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:**U.S. citizens who arrive by yacht or private boat should be aware that all marine harbors are high security zones. Travelers arriving by sea should be prepared for Sri Lankan navy officials to inspect their vessels and should always wait for radio clearance before coming into port.

Mariners planning travel to Sri Lanka should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
