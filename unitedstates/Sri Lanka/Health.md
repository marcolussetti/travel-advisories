For emergency services in Sri Lanka, dial 1990.

Ambulance services are widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. They are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

See our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

Check the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Traveler Advice for [Sri Lanka](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/sri-lanka?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

* Review all sub-sections. These include Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center). CDC Traveler Advice provides advice on medical considerations including:
  + Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
  + Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
  + General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.lk/) to ensure the medication is legal in Sri Lanka.

**Vaccinations**: Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recommended vaccines for the region include those against Japanese encephalitis, typhoid, and, for some travelers, rabies (pre-exposure prophylaxis).

**Air Quality**: Visit [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates and [ZephAir](https://zephair.stategdi.cloud/locations) for additional locations.

**Health facilities in general:** There are six large hospitals in the Colombo area, including four facilities with emergency medical and trauma service:

* Asiri Surgical Hospital
* Lanka Hospital
* Asiri Central Hospital
* Government-run National Hospital of Sri Lanka

Medical facilities outside Colombo are limited. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Generally, government-run hospitals provide free healthcare services to any walk-in patient. The availability of medical supplies is inconsistent. Travelers should always carry necessary prescription medications with them. Serious medical conditions can require evacuation to the United States or to a nearby country with more advanced medical facilities.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:** In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Infectious Diseases:** Several mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are present in Sri Lanka. Dengue fever is widespread in Sri Lanka’s Western Province, where the capital Colombo is located. Adequate mosquito protection is strongly advised to prevent this serious illness.
