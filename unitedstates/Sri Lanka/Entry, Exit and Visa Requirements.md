# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens visiting Sri Lanka must have either an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) or a visa to enter Sri Lanka.

U.S. citizens intending to visit Sri Lanka for purposes of tourism or transit require an approval notice from Sri Lanka’s [Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) System](https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/), onward/return ticket, and proof of sufficient funds. The ETA system is available online or at the port of entry; however, visitors are strongly urged to use the online system to avoid lengthy delays at the port of entry. This travel authorization allows for a stay up to 30 days.

U.S. citizens intending to visit Sri Lanka for short-term business activities such as participating in business meetings, engaging in business negotiations, or attending conferences and workshops are required to obtain a business ETA. Business ETAs can only be obtained from the nearest Sri Lankan Embassy or Consulate before arrival in Sri Lanka, or at the port of entry in Sri Lanka.

U.S. citizens intending to visit Sri Lanka for religious or volunteer work or for local employment must obtain entry visas from the nearest Sri Lankan Embassy or Consulate before arrival in Sri Lanka. These visas are not available at the port of entry or through the online system.

All visitors staying beyond the expiration date of their visa must obtain an extension from the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo and pay the relevant visa fees or apply for an online [Visa Extension](https://eservices.immigration.gov.lk/vs/home.php)
