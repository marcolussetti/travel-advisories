# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:**While in Pakistan, you will encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Road infrastructure outside major cities is subject to weather and poor maintenance. The information below about Pakistan is provided for general reference only, and it might vary in a particular location or circumstance.

**Traffic Laws:**Traffic in Pakistan moves on the left; the opposite of U.S. traffic. Roads are crowded, drivers are often aggressive and poorly trained, and many vehicles, particularly large trucks and buses, are poorly maintained. Local drivers may drive head-on in your lane of traffic if they believe it helps them get to their destination more quickly. Animals, horse carts, bicyclists, and pedestrians can pose roadside hazards in some areas. Roads, including most major highways, also suffer from poor maintenance and often have numerous potholes, sharp drop-offs, and barriers that are not sign-posted. Drivers should exercise extreme caution when traveling at night by road, since many vehicles do not have working headlights or dimmers, and many roads are not illuminated or signed. We recommend driving with experienced local drivers or guides.

**Public Transportation:**We recommend travelers remain cautious if using trains, taxis, and other forms of public transportation or online ride hailing services. For security reasons, U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using all forms of public transportation. See the Safety and Security section above.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.  Visit the website of [Pakistan’s national tourist office](http://www.tourism.gov.pk/) and [Pakistan’s national highway authority](http://nha.gov.pk/en/).

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Pakistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:**  Mariners planning travel to Pakistan should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
