# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The Government of Pakistan requires all travelers age 12 and over to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

All travelers are subject to random COVID-19 testing at all points of entry/exit.  This policy is in effect until further notice and affects all international airports.  U.S. citizen travelers are not exempt from this requirement and may be tested for COVID-19.

Those testing positive for COVID-19 with the rapid test at the point of entry to Pakistan will then have a sample taken for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and be given home isolation instructions.  Travelers should not expect to be returned to their previous destination, nor quarantined at the Port of Entry/Exit.

Requirements for entry and exit:

* Valid passport
* Valid Pakistani visa
* Dual nationals only: National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP)

Obtain your visa at the Pakistani Embassy or a Consulate prior to initiating travel to Pakistan. Visit the [Embassy of Pakistan](https://embassyofpakistan.com/) website for the most current visa information, and please understand that the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Pakistan cannot assist you with Pakistani visa issues.

All U.S. government employees and immediate family members on U.S. government orders must follow appropriate procedures for official and personal travel to Pakistan. All official U.S. government travel requests must be submitted via the normal country clearance process and will be limited to mission-critical travel only. U.S. government employees wishing to conduct unofficial travel to Pakistan must contact the appropriate office in their home agency to determine whether there are any limitations or restrictions.  Official U.S. government travelers must be aware that operational and personal security policies for official U.S. government personnel change frequently.

**Dual Nationals:** Be aware that different visa requirements may apply if you hold both U.S. and Pakistani citizenship. For more information see the Embassy of Pakistan’s information regarding [National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) and Pakistan Origin Cards (POC)](https://id.nadra.gov.pk/identity-documents/identity-nicop/)

U.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you travel to Pakistan on a NICOP or POC card, you will be considered a citizen of Pakistan, which may limit the amount of assistance and communication we can provide should you be arrested. For more information see [Government of Pakistan Directorate General of Immigration and Passports](http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/Immigration.aspx).

You must obtain advance permission from local or federal authorities to travel in:

* Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)
* Various districts in Azad Kashmir
* Province of Balochistan

Stay in compliance with Pakistani immigration regulations. If you overstay your visa or violate the terms, you may be detained, arrested, fined, and/or imprisoned. For further details see the [Ministry of Interior website](http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/Visa.aspx) or call +92-51-920-7290.

Keep copies of your U.S. passport data page, Pakistani visa or ID card, and Pakistan immigration entry stamp with you at all times. Consider downloading these documents to your mobile phone in case of emergency.

**Vaccinations:** With the exception of a COVID-19 vaccination, no routine vaccines are required when entering Pakistan from the United States, but proof of polio vaccination within one year may be required to exit Pakistan. See the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/) for recommended vaccinations and health tips for travel to Pakistan.
