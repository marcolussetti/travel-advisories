The Government of Pakistan requires travelers age 12 and over be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pakistan reports Pakistan has endemic Wild Polio Virus. The government of Pakistan requires polio vaccination for some longer stays. Healthcare facilities and infrastructure is poor, especially outside major cities. Travelers are advised to have medevac insurance, to include repatriation of remains. Both medevacs and repatriations of remains for non-Pakistani citizens require Pakistani government permission.

Basic medical care is available in major Pakistani cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities in cities vary in quality and range of services and may be below U.S. standards; facilities in rural areas are consistently below U.S. standards. Medical facilities require pre-payment for services, and most do not accept credit cards.

Effective emergency response to personal injury and illness is virtually non-existent in most of Pakistan. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel.

If you are hospitalized, a friend or family member will be expected to attend to your basic needs. There is generally no nursing staff or equivalent. For this reason, it is recommended never to travel alone to Pakistan. Outside major cities, English is not spoken by most medical providers and hospitals.

Pakistani hospital officials will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is hospitalized. Even if made aware of a medical situation, in some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to travel restrictions.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [doctors and hospitals](https://pk.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). However, we do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for [Pakistan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/pakistan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

* [Tuberculosis](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/tb/default.htm)

There is a risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV, in Pakistan. Travelers are urged to use the same cautionary and protective health measures they would in their own country. For emergency services in Pakistan, **dial** **15.**

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Travelers to Pakistan should obtain supplemental insurance to cover possible medical evacuation and repatriation of remains. If you plan to engage in high-risk outdoor activities in Pakistan, it is essential that you engage the services of a travel risk and crisis management provider.

Care providers in Pakistan do not accept insurance.  With the exception of State and military hospitals, providers will require payment before treatment. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Vaccinations**

 Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/pakistan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Visitors and foreign residents should bring sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available, there is a high incidence of fake pharmaceuticals, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Pakistan to ensure the medication is legal in Pakistan.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) websites for more information.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant environmental problem across Pakistan. Throughout the country, air quality varies considerably by city and fluctuates greatly depending on the season and local weather patterns. We encourage you to consult with your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. It is typically at its worst during the winter in Pakistan. Anyone who travels to areas where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens;
* People over 65 years of age;
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease; and
* People who work or are active outdoors.

Air quality data for major cities in Pakistan can be found on the U.S. Embassy’s [website](https://pk.usembassy.gov/air-quality-data/).

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Pakistan.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Water Quality**

* Throughout Pakistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
* Sanitation in most restaurants is inadequate. Diarrheal illnesses are common. Travelers to Pakistan are at risk for other infectious diseases as well. More information about these illnesses and how to protect against them can be found on the [CDC webpage for Pakistan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/pakistan)

**Adventure Travel:** Pakistan’s mountains and glaciers make it a tempting destination for adventure enthusiasts. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting visitors lost or injured in such remote areas can be difficult. In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing in the Karakoram mountain range, where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute. Costs for emergency rescues start at $15,000, and payment is required prior to commencement of a search operation.

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).

**Altitude**

Some areas in Pakistan, especially K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) in the Karakorum mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
