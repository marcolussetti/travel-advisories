# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Violent extremist groups within Pakistan continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and other Westerners are known to congregate or visit, including:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Government facilities
* Schools and universities
* Shopping malls and markets
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by Westerners and tourists
* Public transportation hubs/stations
* Minority neighborhoods
* Outdoor recreation areas.

Terrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, security forces, and religious minorities.

We recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations.

Attacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military and police installations, and airports. Primary tactics of terrorists include suicide operations, shootings, and bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), while other actions include but are not limited to assassinations, carjackings, kidnappings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day. However, the U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports.

The U.S. Embassy and Consulates regularly assess security situations and restrict the movements of official personnel as necessary.  Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission (COM) security responsibility. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates prohibit personnel under COM security responsibility from using public transportation or taxi services. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates also prohibit such personnel from visiting houses of worship.

Official U.S. government personnel visiting Pakistan are authorized to stay overnight in certain local hotels in Islamabad, and some other areas of the country.  Avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official U.S. government personnel on official travel/orders.

Follow media coverage of local events and maintain good situational awareness and operational security wherever you travel in Pakistan. If you feel that your life is in danger in Pakistan, we advise you to report the threat to local police authorities and consider immediately changing locations or departing Pakistan.

**Crime:**All travelers are advised to dress conservatively, with arms and legs covered, and to avoid walking alone. We recommend avoiding travel on the streets late at night. Urban crime can be organized or opportunistic and conducted by individuals or groups. It can include fraud, theft, robbery, carjacking, assault, and burglary. Incidents of crime and levels of violence are higher in low-income residential and congested commercial areas but are seen in wealthier areas as well. Pickpocketing, theft, and larceny are common on buses and trains at all hours of the day.

Take precautions to avoid crime, including:

* Locking home and vehicle doors
* Varying routes and schedules
* Keeping bags or valuables under your legs away from passing vehicle traffic and ensuring that bag straps are not visible
* Traveling in groups
* Being accompanied by someone with the ability to speak the local language if you travel outside urban areas
* Carrying your mobile phone

If you are assaulted, flee to a safe area and report the situation to local authorities by going directly to a police station or dialing **15**.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to local, national, or international current events, including on politically significant holidays.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Demonstrations, political rallies, or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. U.S Embassy and Consulate personnel are routinely instructed to avoid areas of any demonstration. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates.

The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General generally do not message or post information about routine demonstrations but will disseminate known information regarding demonstrations or unrest that pose a potentially specific threat to U.S. citizens, including U.S. government personnel in country.

Celebratory gunfire may occur at any time but is most likely to occur during wedding celebrations, which are frequent from October to May, and on holidays such as New Year’s Eve. Although the likelihood of being struck is remote, falling rounds can cause injury or death.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 15 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(92)(51) 201-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Police responsiveness varies widely, and crimes often go unsolved or unprosecuted.

Dual U.S-Pakistani nationals may not be recognized as U.S. citizens by local authorities and may be treated as Pakistani nationals by the police and the courts.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or the Consulates in Karachi or Lahore for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not regularly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
