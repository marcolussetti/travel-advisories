# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  U.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. The U.S. government does not intervene with local authorities or advocate for particular outcomes on behalf of private individuals in legal matters.

Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local laws. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.htm)  and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings or structures, particularly sensitive places like military installations, cantonments, and nuclear sites, but the law on this subject is vague and applied inconsistently.

It is illegal to import alcohol into Pakistan without prior coordination with the government and even then, it is permissible only under very specific circumstances. Travelers entering Pakistan with alcohol face *potentially severe* penalties. Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in imprisonment and other severe penalties.

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Pakistan are severe, and those convicted can expect lengthy imprisonment, heavy fines, and possible capital punishment.

Exit controls, or bans on departing the country, are frequently used as a condition of bail.

**Civil Matters**: The Embassy often receives reports of property disputes and cannot become involved in civil matters.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

Pakistani law enforcement authorities will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is arrested or detained, unless you request they do so. Pakistan’s regulations governing the travel of foreign diplomats and the procedures for gaining access to arrested individuals have delayed consular access in the past. In some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to security-related travel restrictions.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Uzbekistan.html#ExternalPopup) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:**See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:**Same-sex sexual conduct is a criminal offense in Pakistan. While the government rarely prosecutes cases, society generally shuns LGB persons, and violence and discrimination against LGB persons occur frequently.

The penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, imprisonment (sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment), or both. No laws protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and LGB persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for additional details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  Even in major cities, accessibility for persons with physical disabilities is difficult.  Pakistani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, **but** the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Do not expect public transportation, lodging, communication/information, or general infrastructure in Pakistan to have the same accessibility standards found in the United States. The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for equipment and devices is limited, especially outside major population areas. Services for persons with disabilities may also be limited outside the largest cities.

**Students:**  See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General often receive reports of U.S. citizens subjected to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and forced marriage in Pakistan. There are also cases of individuals having their own and their children’s passports confiscated by spouses, parents, or other family members and having their freedom of movement severely restricted. Local police are not consistently responsive to reports of such cases. Nonetheless, if you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with a Pakistani non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance.

If you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the [U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women](https://www.justice.gov/ovw).

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Pakistan
