**Road Conditions and Safety:**While in Lithuania, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Roads in Lithuania range from well-maintained two-to four-lane highways connecting major cities, to small dirt roads crossing the countryside.

**Traffic Laws:**You may drive in Lithuania for up to 90 days with a U.S. driver’s license.

* Seat belts are mandatory for the driver and all passengers. Children under the age of three must be seated in the back seat in a child seat appropriate for their age and size.
* Driving under the influence is considered a very serious offense and carries heavy penalties. The legal limit in Lithuania is the equivalent of 0.04% BAC.
* You must have at least your low beam lights on at all times while driving.
* Pedestrians have the right of way at crosswalks.
* When involved in a traffic accident, Lithuanian law requires you to leave your vehicle where it is and immediately notify the police (112).
* Drivers must carry a driver’s license, insurance, registration, etc. in the vehicle at all times.
* The phone number for roadside assistance is 8-800-01414 from a regular phone. 1414 from a GSM mobile phone.

**Public Transportation:**Public transportation is considered safe and is readily available via taxi, Uber, or bus. If utilizing taxi services, we recommend that travelers place a request via phone, app, or hotel to ensure their safety. As in every situation, travelers should be aware of their surroundings, specifically within large crowds where petty theft could occur.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Lithuania, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Lithuania’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners traveling to Lithuania should check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
