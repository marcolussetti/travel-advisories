Medical care in Lithuania has improved, but facilities may be limited outside urban areas.

Medical facilities do not always meet Western standards. Payment is expected upon admission at private hospitals*.*

For emergency services in Lithuania, dial 112 (English-speaking operators are available)

Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Please review the Lithuanian rules for importing medication into Lithuania [here](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flrmuitine.lt%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fkeleiviams%2Fvaistai%23en&data=04%7C01%7CGiauqueI%40state.gov%7Cb201b1a9aef24be47bd908d87733468f%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637390409408855300%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Hxl628Kw9E29mSZ%2Biojb1IEATBzJsBIbxRXDmPeBam8%3D&reserved=0).

The Lithuanian government does not require HIV testing for U.S. citizens. Sexually transmitted diseases are a growing public health problem.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
