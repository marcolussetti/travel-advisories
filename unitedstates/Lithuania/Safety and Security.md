# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries, including Lithuania, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

Foreigners, ethnic minorities, and members of the LGB community have been victims of harassment, physical assaults, and even robbery. This tends to occur late at night near bars and nightclubs.

Marches and protests do occur, especially in larger cities. You should avoid areas where protests are taking place.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common, particularly at popular tourist sites and restaurants, and on public transportation. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, using the jostling of people as a distraction.

* Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe.
* Thefts from cars and car thefts occur regularly. Do not leave valuables in rental cars.
* Avoid walking alone at night.
* Only use taxi services arranged by phone.
* Avoid using automatic teller machines (ATMs) in isolated or poorly lighted areas; use the buddy system and indoor bank ATMs when possible.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of metropolitan areas, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
