**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116)’s website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Lithuania are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
