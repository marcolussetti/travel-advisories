# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Since the imposition of the National Security Law (NSL) on June 30, 2020, the PRC has targeted a broad range of activities it classifies as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities under the NSL. In 2024, the Hong Kong government enacted the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO), which codified offenses for treason, sedition, theft of “state secrets,” and external interference. These laws purport to cover offenses regardless of citizenship or location, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC and/or the administration of Hong Kong to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. U.S. citizens could be subject to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans. On multiple occasions, Hong Kong authorities have offered cash awards that unjustly target overseas democracy advocates, including a U.S. citizen and other individuals based in the United States. PRC security forces operate in Hong Kong and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong judiciary.

**Drug and Alcohol Enforcement:** PRC law enforcement authorities have no tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana and **products containing cannabidiol, also known as CBD**. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC and Hong Kong are severe, and convicted offenders face long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty.

Hong Kong strictly prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol. Violations can lead to immediate criminal charges and/or detention.

**Demonstrations:**Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as violating Hong Kong law, including the National Security Law, could result in criminal charges.

We strongly caution U.S. citizens to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.

If you decide to travel to Hong Kong:

* Monitor local media, local transportations sites and apps like [MTR Mobile](https://www.mtr.com.hk/mtrmobile/en/) or [CitybusNWFB](https://www.citybus.com.hk/home/), and the [Hong Kong International Airport website](https://www.hongkongairport.com/) for updates and traffic advisories.
* Avoid the areas of the demonstrations.
* Exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.
* Avoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.
* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Keep a low profile.

Hong Kong has a low crime rate. Even so, you should exercise caution and pay particular attention to personal belongings while in crowded areas and traveling on public transportation. Violent crime, though rare, does occur.

* Take routine safety precautions.
* Report any concerns to the local police.
* Call “999,” the local equivalent to “911,” in an emergency.

Mace, pepper spray, stun guns, bullets, switch blades, knuckle-dusters and other self-protection weapons are banned in Hong Kong.

Be alert to criminal schemes, such as internet, phone, dating, and financial scams. See the [U.S. Department of State's](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at “999” and contact U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau at +(825) 2523-9011. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may first wish to contact U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/victims-of-crime/?_ga=2.112844290.745774761.1730957984-708834691.1718595781).

We can:

Hong Kong has a crime victim compensation program available to U.S. citizens who are victims of crime in Hong Kong. For more detailed information on the program and its requirements, please see the [Hong Kong Social Welfare Department webpage.](https://www.swd.gov.hk/en/index/site_pubsvc/page_socsecu/sub_criminalan/) More resources for victims of crime in Hong Kong are available in our [Help for U.S. Victims of Crime in Hong Kong](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/help-for-u-s-citizen-victims-of-crime-in-hong-kong-sar/) information sheet.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau and/or the [Hong Kong police](https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/index.html) for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated, and best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage. Professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout Hong Kong. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. We encourage U.S. citizens to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
