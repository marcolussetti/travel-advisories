# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to Hong Kong laws, including certain PRC laws applied to Hong Kong. If you violate Hong Kong laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities before practicing or operating a business.

**Arrest Notification:**

* If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau immediately.
* Hong Kong must notify a U.S. consular officer within four days if a U.S. citizen is arrested if you have traveled on a U.S. document. However, this does not always occur in a timely manner.
* The PRC and Hong Kong do not recognize dual nationality. The PRC and Hong Kong may prevent the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulates General from providing consular services to dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens with familial or historical ties to the PRC and/or Hong Kong. Please review our page on [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) for more information on the limits on consular notification and access to dual nationals.
* A U.S. consular officer may be the only authorized visitor during your initial detention period.
* Detention may last many months before a trial.
* U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau is unable to represent you in a legal matter.
* See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information on arrests overseas.

Hong Kong law provides for an independent judiciary, but Beijing’s actions have eroded the judiciary’s independence and ability to uphold the rule of law, particularly in cases designated as involving national security. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC and Hong Kong may be subject to scrutiny from PRC state security and Hong Kong local law enforcement. In Hong Kong, police have the right to detain you for questioning if you are not carrying your passport.

Some crimes committed overseas can be prosecuted in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [U.S. Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

**Assisted Reproductive Technology:** Hong Kong strictly forbids surrogacy. Surrogacy contracts are not valid under local law and will not be enforced. Reproductive technology used for medical research and profit is strictly controlled.

**Controlled Items in Hong Kong:** Hong Kong strictly enforces its regulations on controlled items transiting Hong Kong. This includes temporary importation and re-export. Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) thoroughly screens luggage loaded onto aircraft in Hong Kong. This applies to all baggage regardless of whether the passenger is departing or transiting. If the authorities discover weapons or ammunition of any kind, the police will investigate the owner of the luggage, who may be arrested or detained. Weapons and ammunition include mace, pepper spray, stun guns, bullets, air gun pellets, switch blades, handcuffs, self-defense batons, knuckle-dusters, and other self-protection weapons.

If you bring controlled items into Hong Kong without the necessary Hong Kong permits, the goods may be seized, and you may be prosecuted. The penalty for trafficking in dangerous drugs can be life imprisonment and/or a heavy fine. You must also declare liquors, tobacco, cigarettes and cigars, methyl alcohol, and merchandise imported for commercial purposes. There are no currency restrictions for travelers. Please refer to the [Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department](https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/service-enforcement-information/passenger-clearance/prohibited-controlled-items/index.html#:~:text=The%20commonly%20found%20prohibited%20%2F%20controlled,poultry%2C%20eggs%20and%20powdered%20formula.) for more details.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of controlled and/or prohibited items:

* dangerous drugs

* ammunition
* weapons
* fireworks
* strategic commodities
* rough diamonds

U.S. Customs and Border Protection encourages the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) carnet document for the temporary admission of professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for exhibitions and fair purposes. For additional information, please visit the [U.S. Council for International Business website](https://uscib.org/) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection web page on [Traveling with Samples](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/clearing-cbp/business-government-samples).

Please see our [Customs Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) sheet for general information.

**Dual Nationality:** Dual nationality is not recognized under [PRC nationality law](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/chinese/law.html). Be mindful of the following special circumstances for dual nationals when traveling in the region.

Enter Hong Kong on your U.S. passport to ensure U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau can provide consular assistance in case of arrest or other emergencies. Regardless of your travel documents, if you are a dual national, or otherwise have familial or historical ties to the PRC, it is possible that Hong Kong authorities will assert that you are a PRC citizen and deny your access to U.S. consular representatives if you are detained.

Your child will be considered a PRC citizen if one or both parents are PRC nationals, regardless of U.S. citizenship.

If traveling onward to mainland China, enter mainland China on your U.S. passport to ensure U.S. consular protection. See our [China International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/china.html) page for more information.

For further information on consular protection and [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html), please refer to our website.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Such products are illegal in the United States and purchasing them may also violate local law. You may be subject to fines or must give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Cruise Ship Passengers:**Please see our [Cruise Ship Passengers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/cruise-ship-passengers.html) page for safety information and travel advice.

**Earthquakes:** Earthquakes occur throughout the PRC and have affected Hong Kong in the past. Check here for information about [earthquake preparedness](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html).

**LGB Travelers:** Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in the PRC and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation though homosexuality has been decriminalized. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. There are growing LGB communities in some of the largest cities in the PRC and violence against LGB individuals in the PRC is relatively rare. See [Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for Hong Kong](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/hong-kong/) and read our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html).

**Pets:** You must have a permit to bring dogs and cats into Hong Kong. Dogs and cats imported from the United States may be exempted from quarantine under certain circumstances. Please find more information on importing pets on the [Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department website.](https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/index.html)

**Political Activity:**Participating in unauthorized political activities, including participating in unauthorized public protests, or writing or reposting social media posts, even when posted outside of Hong Kong and PRC, or other online publications critical of the government,may result in detention, criminal charges, and/or PRC government-imposed restrictions on future travel to the PRC and/or Hong Kong.

**Social Media:** Social media accounts are widely monitored in the PRC and Hong Kong. Social media posts—even content posted outside of Hong Kong—that local authorities deem illegal may result in criminal charges against both the poster of the material and the administrator of the social media forum.

**Students:** See our [U.S. Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Surveillance and Monitoring:** While less prevalent than in mainland China, security personnel carefully watch foreign visitors and may place them under surveillance. Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, Internet usage, and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without the owner’s consent or knowledge.

**Transferring Money to/From Hong Kong:**The U.S. Department of State may be able to help transfer funds to a destitute U.S citizen overseas through our office in Washington, D.C. More information on this process is available on our [Sending Money to Destitute U.S. Citizens Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/sending-money-abroad.html).

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Sidewalks often do not have curb cuts, and many streets can be crossed only via pedestrian bridges or underpasses accessible by staircase. Assistive technologies for blind people and those with other vision disabilities are unreliable, and access to elevators in public buildings can be restricted. Public restrooms in places visited by tourists usually have a least one accessible toilet.

Hong Kong law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. This applies in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. The government generally enforces these protections. The law requires access to buildings, information, and communications for persons with disabilities. The [Hong Kong Social Welfare Department](https://www.swd.gov.hk/en/) is primarily responsible for coordinating and funding public assistance programs to persons with disabilities. The [Hong Kong Tourism Board](https://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/index.html) publishes “[Accessible Hong Kong](https://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/plan/traveller-info/accessibletravel.html),” a guide for visitors with disabilities and the [Hong Kong Transport Department](https://www.td.gov.hk/en/home/index.html) publishes [A Guide to Public Transport for People with Disabilities](https://www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/services_for_the_people_with_disabilities/index.html). In addition, the Hong Kong government created [Cyberable](https://cyberable.swd.gov.hk/en/index.html) to provide one-stop information for persons with various disabilities.

**Weather:** Hong Kong is subject to strong typhoons and tropical storms, usually from July through September. The [Hong Kong Observatory](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/index.html) has an excellent notification and monitoring system and issues typhoon warnings when warranted and heavy rainstorm and hot weather alerts frequently. If Hong Kong announces a Typhoon Signal 8 or above, or a Black Rainstorm Warning, the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau will be closed for services. You may find additional information on typhoon and storm preparedness on the [Hurricane Preparedness](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/typhoon-tips/) and [Natural Disasters](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) pages of the Bureau of Consular Affairs website.

For current information, please consult the [Joint Typhoon Warning Center](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html) and the [National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/?cpac).
