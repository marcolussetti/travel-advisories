[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Hong Kong Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/index.html) website for the most current visa information.

Find information on [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html), [prevention of international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention.html), and [customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) on our website.

To enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong), you need:

* A passport that is valid for at least one month beyond the date of your intended stay.
* Adequate funds to cover your stay without working locally.
* Evidence of onward/return transportation.

You only need a visa if:

* You plan to stay for more than 90 days.  If needed, you can apply for a visa extension at the Hong Kong Immigration Department.
* You plan to work or study in Hong Kong.  You must get a visa before arriving in Hong Kong.  Please contact the [Hong Kong Immigration Department](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/index.html) for more information.

You must have a valid passport and People’s Republic of China (PRC) visa to enter mainland China from Hong Kong.  Further information on travel in the PRC and the Macau Special Administrative Region is available on our [China International Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/china.html) and [Macau International Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Macau.html) pages.

**West Kowloon Train Station:**The West Kowloon Train Station is the end of the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL).  Once you pass through the Hong Kong immigration exit on the way to mainland China, either inside the train station or on the train itself, you are in mainland China’s area of authority where immigration and law enforcement matters are handled by mainland authorities and not by the Hong Kong authorities.  Likewise, if you are arriving from mainland China, you have not entered Hong Kong until you pass through the Hong Kong immigration entry checkpoint; any legal matters occurring before that point would be handled by mainland authorities.
