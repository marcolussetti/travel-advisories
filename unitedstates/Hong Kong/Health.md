For emergency services in Hong Kong, dial 999.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**Quality of Care:**Good medical facilities are available, and there are many Western-trained physicians. Hong Kong emergency service response times for police, fire, and ambulances are good.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our [Insurance Providers for Overseas Coverage page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) website for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Payment and Insurance:** Travelers will be asked to pay a deposit prior to admission to hospitals in Hong Kong to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals and clinics generally accept credit cards.

U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong & Macau maintains a list of local [English-speaking doctors and hospitals](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Medication**: Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Prescription drugs are widely available in Hong Kong, although names may vary. You need a prescription from a doctor in Hong Kong to purchase medications locally. Bring prescription medications to cover your stay in Hong Kong or plan to see a physician in Hong Kong to obtain a new prescription. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Hong Kong](https://www.gov.hk/en/nonresidents/) to ensure the medication is legal in Hong Kong.

**Air Quality**: The air quality in Hong Kong varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically worse in the summer.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens;
* People over 65 years of age;
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease or diabetes; and
* People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
