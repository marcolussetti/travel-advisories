**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States.

* Traffic moves on the left.
* Speed limits vary depending on location.
* Use of seatbelts is mandatory.
* You can drive using your U.S. driver’s license for up to a year.  If you hold a valid U.S. driver’s license and have resided in the United States at least six months, you can apply for a Hong Kong driver’s license. Visit the [Hong Kong Transport Department](https://www.td.gov.hk/en/home/index.html) for further details.

**Traffic Laws:**Many traffic violations are like those in the United States, including penalties for reckless driving, driving under the influence, and using a hand-held device while operating a vehicle. Hong Kong law requires that all registered vehicles carry valid third-party liability insurance.

**Public Transportation:**Approximately 90 percent of the population in Hong Kong depends on public transport. Taxis, buses, and the mass transit railway (MTR) are readily available, inexpensive, and generally safe. The MTR, an underground railway network, is the most popular mode of public transport, carrying an average of 3.5 million passengers a day.  
  
**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed Hong Kong’s Civil Aviation Department (CAD) as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Hong Kong's air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s Safety Assessment Page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Hong Kong should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Hong Kong ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.
