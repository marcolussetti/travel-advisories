# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: The EN4 toll road between Maputo and South Africa is well-maintained. The road network connecting provincial capitals is in fair condition, but can be riddled with potholes and other obstacles. Vehicles on certain sections of the EN1 roadway in Sofala and Manica provinces and the EN6 between Beira and Chimoio have been shot at and the Government of Mozambique has instituted convoys on some stretches of the road. U.S. Embassy officials are restricted from traveling in Sofala or Manica on the EN1 between the Save River (in the south) and the city of Caia (in the north) and on the EN6 between Beira and Chimoio. Restrictions are also in place on the EN7 from Nova Vanduzi to Luenha.

* U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling outside cities after dark because of the increased risk of banditry, poor road conditions in some areas, poor maintenance of many vehicles in the country (e.g., no headlights or rear lights), as well as the threat imposed by livestock grazing on roadsides and intoxicated drivers.
* Travel outside Maputo often requires a four-wheel drive vehicle, which creates an additional security risk since these vehicles are high-theft items. Public transportation is limited and often has poor safety standards.

**Accidents** Serious traffic accidents are one of the greatest threats to U.S. citizens in Mozambique. Accidents involving drivers and pedestrians are common and sometimes fatal. The potential for accidents increases at night due to unseen holes and obstructions, poor lighting conditions, pedestrians on the highways, and other vehicles driving without headlights. If a serious accident occurs or if a driver hits a pedestrian, crowds quickly gather.

* **Mozambican law requires parties to an accident to render assistance**; however, you should exercise your best judgment. Render assistance if necessary and practical, but only if you feel you can do so without placing yourself at risk.
* Report the accident to the nearest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Traffic Laws**:Drivers should obey police signals to stop at checkpoints, which are common throughout Mozambique. Foreigners visiting Mozambique for more than 90 days are required to have an International Driver’s License or to obtain a Mozambican driver’s license.  
  
**Public Transportation**: The U.S. Embassy advises U.S. citizens not to use “*chapas*” (local minibuses) as a method of transportation due to frequent, often fatal accidents involving these vehicles.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mozambique, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mozambique’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
