Updated to change overall Travel Advisory Level from 2 to 3 and to add the civil unrest risk indicator due to ongoing demonstrations.

**Do Not Travel To:**

* Certain districts in Cabo Delgado and Nampula Provinces due to **terrorism**.

**Country Summary:** Protests frequently occur throughout the country and can quickly become violent. Most protests occur in Maputo, and some have turned violent. Protesters have also engaged in rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Police responses to protests and large gatherings can quickly become violent, including the use of live ammunition and tear gas. Conversely, police may refuse to maintain public order. Protests may temporarily block major roads, including border crossings and roads leading to airports, making travel unpredictable.

Violent crime, such as muggings, is common.

Terrorist groups in northern Mozambique continue to be active. Attackers may strike public areas with little or no warning.

Mozambique’s health infrastructure is weak, medicine availability is variable and often in short supply. Hospitals remain open, roads leading to the airports are intermittently blocked by protesters, potentially impacting medical evacuation efforts.
