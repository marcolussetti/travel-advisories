Updated to reflect change in overall travel advisory level from 3 to 2 due to decrease of election related protests, and addition of Niassa Special Reserve to Do Not Travel section.

Exercise increased caution when traveling to Mozambique due to **health issues**, **crime, civil unrest,** and **terrorism**. Some areas have greater risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel To:**

* Cabo Delgado Province, the Niassa Special Reserve inside Niassa Province, and certain districts in the north of Nampula Province due to **terrorism**.

**Country Summary:**Unplanned protests remain possible throughout the country and can quickly become violent. Protests may temporarily block major roads, including toll booths and border crossings.

Violent crime, such as mugging, is common.

Mozambique’s health infrastructure is weak, medicine availability is variable and often in short supply. Local medical facilities may lack basic resources and supplies, and may require cash payment up front. There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Mozambique. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

Terrorist groups in northern Mozambique continue to be active. Attackers may strike public areas and tourist destinations with little or no warning, sometimes taking hostages. Upscale lodges in remote areas which cater to international big-game hunters have been targeted. Security and police forces may be slow to respond.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) for additional information on travel to Mozambique.

If you decide to travel to Mozambique:

* Avoid all but emergency travel between sunset and sunrise.
* Avoid demonstrations and crowds.

* Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html#_blank).
* Visit the CDC page for the [latest Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel and return to the United States.
* We highly recommend you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
* Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* Have travel documents up to date and easily accessible.
* Keep a low profile.
* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.

**Cabo Delgado Province, the Niassa Special Reserve within Niassa Province, and certain northern districts in Nampula Province – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Terrorists continue to conduct and plot attacks on government forces, villages, and key supply routes in Cabo Delgado Province and the bordering districts of Memba and Erati in Nampula Province. Cabo Delgado’s capitol city of Pemba is vulnerable to attack due to the proximity of violent extremist forces and their increasing sophistication. Upscale hunting lodges in and around the Niassa Special Reserve have been specifically targeted by terrorists with hostages taken.

Although prior terrorist attacks centered around securing resources from government forces, travelers should be aware of their surroundings, especially in large public places.

Be aware of increased government security checkpoints in Cabo Delgado Province.

If you must travel to the affected areas of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, and Nampula Provinces, consider hiring a security firm.
