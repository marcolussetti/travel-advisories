# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to host country laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested or imprisoned.  It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not wherever you go.

* Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.
* **Carry your passport with you at all times. You can be taken in for questioning if you cannot present your passport.**
* Photography of some government buildings may be illegal. Ask before taking pictures.
* Driving under the influence can land you immediately in jail.
* Your U.S. passport will not help avoid arrest or prosecution.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.  
  
**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).  
  
**LGB Travelers:** Mozambique is a very tolerant society. Consensual same-sex relations are not criminalized and there is increasing space in public conversation regarding LGB issues. There remains, however, some societal stigmatization and room for progress in terms of full equal treatment, such as in the registration of LGB groups. Seeour[LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.  
  
**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Although the government legislatively mandates access to public buildings, transportation, and government services for persons with disabilities, few buildings are accessible.

* Restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings have stairs at the entrance without wheelchair ramps, except perhaps at a few major hotels and retail areas.
* Pedestrian paths and transportation are extremely difficult for persons with disabilities.
* Sidewalks are not commonplace and, if they exist, are poorly maintained and dangerous to walk on at night.
* Pedestrian crossings are infrequent and drivers seldom obey traffic signals.
* Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf).

**Women Travelers:**

* **Rape:** The law prohibits rape, including spousal rape, but it is not effectively enforced and is largely unknown in rural areas where the majority of rapes take place. Penalties range from two to eight years’ imprisonment if the victim is 12 years of age or older and 20 to 24 years’ imprisonment if the victim is under 12, according to the new penal code.
* **Domestic Violence:** The law prohibits violence against women. Domestic violence against women, particularly spousal rape and beatings, remain widespread. Abuse of a spouse or unmarried partner is punishable with one to two years in prison, or a greater penalty if in conjunction with another crime.
