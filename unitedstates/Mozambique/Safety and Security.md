# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Please read the full [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mozambique-travel-advisory.html) for Mozambique.

Road travel outside the city after dark is dangerous. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling outside the major cities after dark by car, and are encouraged not to travel outside the city alone. You should be vigilant when you travel in Mozambique and if you travel to/from South Africa, as both countries have high crime rates.

**Crime:** Street crimes, including mugging, purse-snatching, and pick-pocketing are common in Maputo and in secondary cities. Carjackings are rare, but still occur.

* **Pedestrians have been mugged** at all hours of the day. Avoid isolated areas and walking at night, even in well-known tourist areas.
* Avoid walking along the Marginal south of the Southern Sun Hotel and Avenida Friedrich Engels and Rua Caracol.
* Avoid walking along roads bordered by wooded areas, as criminals may hide there.

**Johannesburg International Airport:**

* Secure your bags. Use an airport plastic wrapping service.
* Avoid placing currency and high value items in checked luggage when transiting.

**Landmines:** Mozambique was declared free of all known landmines in 2015; however, there could remain unknown mines in very rural areas. Seek local information before going off-road outside major cities.

Information about **specific safety and security issues** can be found on the U.S. Embassy Maputo’s [website](https://mz.usembassy.gov/).  
  
**Victims of Crime:**

Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at +258 21-49-0723. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

* replace a lost/stolen passport

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Fraud:**The U.S. Embassy in Maputo has received reports of scams which originate online, and involve promises of large inheritances that require international travel. Victims of this type of scam are asked to deliver suitcases from one location to another, and become unwitting narcotics traffickers. Be skeptical about financial promises made by an online contact, and never carry anything that you did not pack yourself.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) page for more information on scams.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  There is some tourism infrastructure, often operated by expatriates, but the host government has limited capacity to regulate.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified, either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the relevant field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical treatment, especially outside normal working hours.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
