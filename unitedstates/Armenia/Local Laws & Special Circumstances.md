# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

Please review the State Department’s page on [Arrests or Detention of U.S Citizens Abroad.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) In addition, many people accused of crimes are held in local prisons in pretrial detention for between two and twelve months with the possibility of posting bail while waiting for a court hearing.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, **ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately**. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* **Possession, trafficking, or the use of narcotic drugs, including marijuana, are illegal**. A prescription for **medical marijuana** will not protect you from prosecution. If you are arrested for a drug offense, you could face detention during the investigation, which can take years to resolve, and a prison sentence after conviction.
* **Electronic cigarettes and related paraphernalia may be perceived as drug related.**
* Armenia does not allow the import of various psychotropic drugs.

**Customs and Exports**:

* Local officials may occasionally seek bribes to perform basic duties.
* Customs authorities may enforce regulations concerning the import/export of items like firearms, pornography, and communications equipment. Please refer to the [Armenian Customs Service](https://www.src.am/am) for further information.
* The export of items of historical value, such as paintings, carpets, and old books, requires advanced authorization from the [Armenian Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, and Sports](https://escs.am/en).

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection [website](https://www.cbp.gov/) and U.S. Department of Justice [website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**Dual nationals**:

* Armenian legislation permits Armenian citizens to hold dual citizenship. Even if you naturalized in the United States, **the Government of Armenia may still consider you an Armenian citizen**. Children born in the United States to two Armenian citizens may also be considered Armenian citizens. Please consult the Armenian government’s [website](https://www.mfa.am/en/citizenship/) on citizenship and read the [Armenian law on citizenship](http://parliament.am/legislation.php?sel=show&ID=1731&lang=eng).
* **Armenian law requires that Armenian citizens enter and depart Armenia on Armenian passports.** Individuals who are dual citizens, or could be, should consult with the [Embassy of Armenia](http://usa.mfa.am/en/) in Washington prior to traveling.
* **Armenian males over the age of 18 are subject to mandatory military service.**Penalties for evading military service include **jail time** and a **substantial fine**. Young dual-citizen U.S.-Armenian men are advised to **consult with the** [Embassy of Armenia](http://usa.mfa.am/en/) prior to traveling. There have been instances where dual nationals have been detained at the airport upon arrival until they can resolve their military service issues.

**Traveling to Play Sports:** If you are traveling to play sports in Armenia, remember that you are subject to local laws. Prior to traveling, please understand the terms of your contract and have plans for after your contract ends. If you require legal assistance the U.S. embassy maintains a [list of local attorneys](https://am.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/attorneys/?_ga=2.27990715.669549644.1543507865-748600773.1498233143). The U.S. Embassy cannot offer legal services.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no antidiscrimination laws protecting LGB individuals in Armenia. Although hate crime provisions exist within Armenia’s criminal code, they are not evenly enforced to aid in the prosecution of crimes against LGB persons. Individuals face the potential of discrimination and harassment by state and private actors. The Department of State’s Human Rights Report documents that LGB persons experienced physical violence, threats of violence, blackmail, and harassment. Police were often unresponsive to reports of abuse against LGB individuals and at times, themselves mistreated LGB persons.

See the [LGB travel information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section six of the [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Armenia law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities but does not fully define “disability.” This law is not consistently enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility issues may include accessible facilities, access to services, and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure, including hospitals, government buildings, and transportation centers. These issues are universal throughout the country, including in Yerevan. There are limited sign language interpreters available. Contact the U.S. Embassy in Armenia to receive this information.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Informal taxis pose threats to people unfamiliar with local conditions, especially to women traveling alone. There have been occasional reports of taxi drivers sexually harassing single, female travelers. See our travel tips for [women travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).
