Outside major cities, medical facilities in Armenia are limited. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [English-speaking doctors.](https://am.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) **Elderly travelers** and those with **existing health problems** may be at risk from **inadequate medical facilities**.

For emergency services in Armenia, dial 911.

Ambulance services are

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in Yerevan
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/armenia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) for Armenia.

  + Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* Review the [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/armenia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including:

The risk of diarrheal disease is high throughout Armenia. Food and water precautions are recommended. Additionally, cases of [brucellosis](https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/index.html) from consuming unpasteurized dairy products have been reported.

**We do not pay medical bills.** **Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.**Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Payment is made at the time of service with a credit card and then receipts are submitted later.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Armenian Ministry of Health](http://www.moh.am/) or the [National Institute of Health](https://new.nih.am/) to ensure the medication is legal in Armenia.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/armenia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons in Armenia. It is typically at its worst in the winter, with smog and particulate pollution in or near cities. Consider the impact air pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://am.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
