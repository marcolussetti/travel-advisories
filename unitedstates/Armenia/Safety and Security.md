# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism page.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html)

**Natural Disasters**: Armenia is prone to earthquakes and landslides. For more information read our [page on Crises and disasters abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_.html).

**Crime:** Crime is relatively low, and violent crime is infrequent. When police are called, they routinely show up; however, they generally do not speak English. **Vehicle break-ins** and **theft** are rare but are the most common crimes. Police indicate that there is a criminal group in Yerevan that targets foreigners and burglarizes rented apartments when the victims are away.

* Matters involving **commercial and investment disputes** can take months or years to resolve as they work their way through the civil courts. The U.S.-Armenia Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) provides that in the event of a dispute between a U.S. investor and the Republic of Armenia, the investor may take the case to international arbitration.
* **Credit card fraud and ATM card skimming occurs**.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the police and then the [U.S. Embassy](https://am.usembassy.gov/embassy/yerevan/) at (+374) 10-494-585 during business hours and (+ 374) 10-494-444 after hours.

Report crimes and requests for emergency services to local authorities by **dialing 911**. English speaking operators are available. Also contact the [U.S. Embassy](https://am.usembassy.gov/) to report your situation.

**Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime**.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Armenia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer. If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.

Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting (kidnapping, arrested, medical emergency)
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs. U.S. citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy in Armenia. Telephone and electronic communications are subject to surveillance at any time and without advisory, which may compromise sensitive information.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Local resources for victims of domestic violence include shelters, medical assistance, and legal aid. Victims of domestic violence may contact [Women’s Support Center](https://www.womensupportcenter.org/) at + (374) 099-887-808 which provides assistance to victims of domestic violence and the [Light House shelter](https://armenianlighthouse.com/) at + (374) 93-327-834, + (374) 43-500-503, or “20-80” which provides shelter and support to victims. In cases of sexual violence or domestic violence, victims may contact the [Women’s Resource Center](https://womenofarmenia.org/) at + (374) 077-991-280 and +374 94 565626, from 9:00 AM to midnight. Victims may also contact [New Generation NGO](https://ngngo.net/en/contact-us-2/) at +374 60378989 or +374 60478989.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may be unable to access areas at a distance from major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
