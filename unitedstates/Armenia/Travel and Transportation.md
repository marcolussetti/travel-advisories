**Road Conditions and Safety:**The information below is provided for general reference only. Road conditions in Armenia differ significantly from those in the United States. Exercise caution when driving in Armenia. Reckless driving is common. Drivers frequently ignore traffic laws.

* **Avoid traveling at night** due to poor road conditions and limited emergency response resources. PedestriaFns often cross dark streets away from designated pedestrian crossings while wearing dark clothing.
* **Yield to aggressive drivers** to reduce your risk of being a victim of aggression. Police may seek bribes during traffic stops.
* Winter travel can be hazardous, especially in mountainous areas.
* Practice defensive driving and watch out for **drunk drivers**, especially on the weekends.
* **Primary roads** are frequently in poor condition with stretches of missing pavement and large potholes. Some roads shown as primary roads on maps are unpaved and can narrow to one lane. Maps may be inaccurate.
* **Secondary roads** are normally in poor condition and are often unpaved. Roads may not have signs. Police and emergency medical services may take a long time to reach remote regions.
* Gasoline quality ranges from good, at reliable stations in cities, to very poor. Do not buy gasoline and other fuels sold out of jars, barrels, and trucks by roadside merchants.
* **Driver’s licenses** from the United States are **not valid** for driving in Armenia. For more information on obtaining an Armenian driver’s license, please visit this [website](http://diaspora.gov.am/en/pages/134/driving).
* Exercise caution on roads near the border with Azerbaijan. Be aware that some portions of the road may cross international boundaries without notice. Roads may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice.

**Traffic Laws:**In case of an accident, all vehicles must remain in place and stay until the arrival of the police. Tourists should always carry a copy of their passport.

Driving regulations are often ignored by drivers, and, as a result, accidents are common. The driving culture is aggressive. Pedestrians and bicycles may not be granted the right of way.

**Public Transportation:**Public transportation, while inexpensive, may be unreliable and uncomfortable. Traveling by local unregistered taxis without meters can also prove difficult if a price is not negotiated ahead of time.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Armenia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Armenia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
