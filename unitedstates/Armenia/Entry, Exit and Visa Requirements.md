# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**You need a valid passport to enter Armenia**. U.S. citizens are allowed visa-free entry to Armenia for up to 180 days per year. For visits of longer than 180 days, you must apply for a residency permit through the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Visit their [website](https://www.mfa.am/en) for the most current visa information.

* **Armenian law requires that Armenian citizens, including dual nationals, enter and depart Armenia on Armenian passports**. Even if you naturalized in the United States, **the Government of Armenia may still consider you an Armenian citizen**. Children born in the United States to two Armenian citizens may also be considered Armenian citizens. Please read the information about Armenian citizenship at the website of the [Embassy of Armenia](https://usa.mfa.am/en/consular-reception/)and also review the Dual Nationality information in the “Local Laws and Special Circumstances” section below.
* If you possess an Armenian “special passport” (a residency permit), you still need a valid U.S. passport to enter Armenia. Border guards have refused to admit U.S. citizens carrying “special passports.” Please visit the [Embassy of Armenia](https://usa.mfa.am/en/consular-reception/) website for further details.

**Border with Azerbaijan:** The border with Azerbaijan remains closed andthe U.S. embassy has prohibited embassy employees and their families from non-essential travel to certain border regions due to the ongoing Armenia-Azerbaijani conflict, see the current [Armenia Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/armenia-travel-advisory.html) for details.

**Border with Turkey**: The land border with Turkey remains closed and is patrolled by Russian Border Guards.

**Border with Iran:**See the [Iran travel advisory.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iran-travel-advisory.html) **The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel to Iran** due to arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. The Department of State maintains its [“Do Not Travel”](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iran-travel-advisory.html) advisory, noting the “very high risk of arrest and detention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly U.S.-Iranian dual nationals.”

**Russian Arrest Warrants:** Armenia routinely shares information about foreign visitors with Russian law enforcement and security services. U.S. citizens may be detained by Armenian authorities upon entry or exit based on Russia law enforcement or security service information. Former and current U.S. government and military personnel with prior travel to Russia may face increased scrutiny.

**Traveling Through Europe:** While Armenia is not located in the Schengen area, many flights to Armenia originate in that area of Europe. If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay**.
* If you plan on transiting a Schengen country review, our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html)..
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
