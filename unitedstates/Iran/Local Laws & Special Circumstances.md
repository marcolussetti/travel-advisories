# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Long prison terms and solitary confinement are common as are punishments including execution, amputation, flogging, blinding, stoning, and fines. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Examples of local laws that you may be unfamiliar with include:

* Former Muslims who have converted to other religions, as well as persons who encourage Muslims to convert, are subject to arrest and possible execution;
* Drinking, possession of alcoholic beverages, and drugs are illegal. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Iran are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Iran executes many people each year on drug-related charges. Penalties for the possession, use, or smuggling of alcoholic beverages may include fines, jail time, or flogging;
* Men and women must adhere to the government-sanctioned dress code; this includes covered hair, arms, and legs for women. The government considers the failure to adhere to its dress code and public displays of affection to be crimes;
* Relations between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal, as are adultery and sex outside of marriage, which are punishable by the death penalty;
* Data storage devices (e.g. DVDs, SD cards) depicting sexual relations and magazines showing unveiled women are forbidden;
* Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited and could result in serious criminal charges, including espionage, which carries the death penalty;
* Importation of pork products is banned; and
* Insulting the government or Muslim faith is strictly forbidden, including on social media. Such violations of Iranian law may result in imprisonment.

Carry a copy of your U.S. passport (biodata page and page with Iranian visa) and some other form of identification with you at all times so that, if questioned by local officials, proof of U.S. citizenship is readily available.

If you are arrested while in Iran, request that the police and prison officials notify the Foreign Interests Section at the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran immediately to ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances. Under Iranian law, detainees may also request legal representation, although the authorities sometimes fail to allow timely access to attorneys.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal:** The Iranian government reportedly has the names of all individuals who filed claims against Iran at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal at The Hague pursuant to the 1981 Algerian Accords. In addition, the Iranian government reportedly has compiled a list of the claimants who were awarded compensation in the Iran Claims Program administered by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Iranian government has allegedly been targeting award-holders who travel to Iran. Some former claimants have reported being questioned by Iranian authorities upon their entry into Iran as to the status of payment of their respective awards with a view to recouping the award money. The Iranian government has also reportedly threatened to prevent U.S. claimants who visit Iran from departing the country until they repay their award.

**Dual Nationality:** U.S. citizens who also possess Iranian citizenship are subject to laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Iran, such as military service or taxes. Iranian-citizen males aged 18-34 are required to perform military service, unless exempt. Young men who have turned 17 years of age will not be allowed to leave Iran without completing their military service.

**Money:** Non-Iranian credit cards and bank cards cannot be used in Iran. You will not be able to access U.S. or foreign bank accounts using ATMs in Iran. You can exchange U.S. dollars for rials, either at banks or with certified money changers. There is no Western Union or similar institution, and bank transfers are not possible. Due to economic sanctions on Iran, U.S. financial institutions have been known to block or freeze accounts accessed via the Internet from Iran.

**Communication:** Pre-paid overseas calling cards are available at most newsagents. The Internet is widely used in Iran. There are Internet cafes in most hotels; however, usage may be monitored. The Iranian government blocks access to many social media sites.

**Sanctions:** U.S. government economic sanctions prohibit most economic activity between U.S. citizens and Iran. The U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has posted to its website [frequently asked questions (FAQs)](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs) that provide guidance on U.S. sanctions related to Iran.

**LGB Travelers**: Same-sex relationships in Iran are criminalized and are punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. LGB individuals are often subject to violence and the law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or recognize LGB] individuals, couples, or families.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Iran prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and access to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

Women in Iran lack certain basic rights such as the freedom to choose their style of dress and restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly. Gender-based violence is more common in Iran than the U.S., especially in rural areas, and reports of this violence in recent years have steadily increased. “Honor killings” or other harmful practices involving mostly women killed by their male relatives in the name of preserving the family’s “honor” are known to occur. There are also reports of fathers or relatives forcing their female family members to enter a marriage against their will. Domestic violence remains a taboo subject in Iran, and Iranian law does not prohibit domestic violence. Hijab enforcement in Iran is becoming stricter. The Government has deployed Hijab enforcers in public to ensure compliance. Hijab defiance has led to assault, arrest and even death.
