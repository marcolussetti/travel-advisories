For emergency services in Iran, dial 115.

Ambulance services are

* Widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards;
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment; and
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Iran.

Basic medical care and medicine are available in the principal cities but may not be available in rural areas in Iran. Medical facilities do not meet U.S. standards and sometimes lack medicine and supplies.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/iran) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* Companies offering surrogacy services, an unregulated industry, are misrepresenting the security situation in Iran. Private companies that arrange such visits and services put U.S. citizens at risk.
* If you are considering traveling to Iran to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html). Carefully consider the length of time needed to obtain a newborn’s required civil documents to avoid any unintended overstay of your visa.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Iran particularly in Ahvaz, Tehran, and Zabol. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens;
  + People over 65 years of age;
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
  + People with heart disease or diabetes; and
  + People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Water Scarcity:** Iran has a water scarcity issue throughout the country, largely impacting rural communities. Iran is prone to significant droughts in the hot summer months. In cities outside of Tehran, water may be harder to obtain given the availability in those regions and larger water reserves servicing the capital. Tap water in Iran is relatively safe, however it is recommended to consume bottled water, which is regularly available.
