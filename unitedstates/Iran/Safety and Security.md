# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

As noted in the [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iran-travel-advisory.html) for Iran, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran face a significant threat of kidnapping or arrest and detention on spurious charges.

U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Advisory should exercise caution throughout the country, but especially in the southeastern region where foreigners have been victims of criminal gangs. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to areas within 100 kilometers of the border with Afghanistan, near the Iraq border, and generally anywhere east of the line from Bam and Bandar Abbas toward the Pakistani border.

**Terrorism:** In Iran, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Additionally, Iran is a designated state-sponsor of terrorism.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Foreigners occasionally become victims of petty street crime, including robberies and bag-snatchings, in Iran. There have been reports of robberies by police impersonators, usually in civilian clothing. Insist on seeing the officer’s identity card and request the presence of a uniformed officer/marked patrol car. Travelers should take the following precautions:

* Do not surrender any documents or cash;
* Make a copy of your U.S. passport (biographical data page and the page with your Iranian visa) and keep it separate from your original passport;
* Do not carry large amounts of hard currency while on the streets;
* Keep important documents such as passports and valuables in hotel safes or other secure locations;
* Take pre-booked taxis, which are safer than those hailed from the street;
* Check with your hotel or tour guide for information on local scams; and
* Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, purchasing them may also violate local law.

**Demonstrations** occur sporadically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Past demonstrations have turned violent.

* As demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, computers, fax machines, and other electronics may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. The Iranian authorities may also confiscate cell phones, computers, and other devices. U.S. citizens should consider not taking electronic devices to Iran or deleting personal information from them beforehand.

**Disaster Preparedness:** Iran is prone to earthquakes, many of them severe. To learn more about the seismic regions of Iran, including the most recent earthquakes, please visit the [U.S. Geological Survey website](https://www.usgs.gov/).

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/romance-scams) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:**

Report crimes to the local police by dialing 110 and contact the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section at (98) (21) 2254-2178. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Iran is: 115 for ambulance service, 125 for fire, and 110 for police. English speakers, however, are generally unavailable.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

The Department of State, through the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section, can:

* Replace a stolen or lost passport;
* Help you find appropriate medical care;
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police;
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent;
* Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms;
* Provide a list of local attorneys;
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States;](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html) and
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section for assistance. U.S. citizens should note that the Foreign Interests Section may be able to provide limited assistance only and that Iranian law does not prohibit domestic violence.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
