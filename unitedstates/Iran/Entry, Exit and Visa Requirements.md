# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Before traveling to Iran, please consider the current [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iran-travel-advisory.html).

The Travel Advisory for Iran is Level 4, Do Not Travel. The Department of State recommends U.S. citizens do not travel to Iran due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens. Exercise increased caution due to wrongful detentions.

Iranian authorities continue to wrongfully detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly U.S.-Iranian dual nationals, on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities have also prevented the departure of U.S. citizens from Iran. U.S. citizens of Iranian origin should consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. Iranian authorities routinely deny dual nationals access to the Foreign Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran because they consider dual nationals to be solely Iranian citizens.

U.S. passports are valid for travel to Iran. However, U.S.-Iranian dual nationals must enter and exit Iran on Iranian passports. As indicated above, the Iranian government does not recognize [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) and will treat U.S.-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens. Iranian authorities may consider some U.S. citizens – even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves to be Iranian – to be Iranian nationals.

U.S. government employees, including contractors, are strictly prohibited from traveling to Iran without prior authorization from the Department of State.

U.S.-Iranian dual nationals should obtain, in their Iranian passports, the necessary visas for the countries they will transit on their return trip to the United States so that if the U.S. passports are confiscated in Iran, they may depart Iran with their Iranian passports. These individuals can then apply for new U.S. passports in the country they are transiting.

U.S. citizens residing in Iran on permanent resident visas must obtain an exit permit each time they depart Iran, regardless of the period of stay. All Iranian passport holders are required to pay an exit tax. More specific information on Iranian passport and exit permit requirements may be obtained from the [Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan](https://daftar.org/) in Washington, D.C.

The Iranian civil code states that women who marry Iranian men acquire Iranian nationality. If the marriage takes place in Iran, the woman’s U.S. passport may be confiscated by Iranian authorities. A woman must have the consent of her husband to leave Iran or, in his absence, consent from another suitable authority. The Foreign Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran can provide only limited assistance if a U.S. citizen woman married to an Iranian man encounters difficulty in leaving Iran. In addition, if marriage to an Iranian citizen is not officially recognized by the Iranian government, the couple will be committing the crime of adultery if they travel together, the maximum penalty for which is death.

Please contact the Swiss Embassy or appropriate Iranian authorities for special circumstances cases involving divorce and custody rights in Iran.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Iran. If you intend to reside in Iran, you must submit to a blood test, which may include an HIV test, in order to apply for a residency permit. Permits will be refused if the HIV test is positive.
