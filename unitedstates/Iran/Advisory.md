***Updated to reflect changes to the “If you decide to travel to Iran” section, add warnings about Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and surrogacy, and updated information on detention risks.***

Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of **terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens,** and **wrongful detention.**

**Country Summary:** Do not travel to Iran for any reason.U.S. citizens in Iran face serious dangers. They have been kidnapped and wrongfully arrested. Some have been held for years on false charges, subjected to psychological torture, and even sentenced to death. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran.

The Department of State has determined that U.S. nationals traveling to Iran are at significant risk of wrongful detention.  Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain U.S. nationals without warning or any evidence they committed a crime.  This includes dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, students, journalists, business travelers, academics, and individuals with U.S. military or government experience.  Charges include espionage and posing a threat to national security.  U.S. nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran.  Having a U.S. passport or connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone.

Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals.  In particular, Iranian authorities consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.

**Terrorism**

Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran.  ISIS and related groups have taken responsibility for bombings and other attacks in the country.  The risk of terrorism and deadly harm to bystanders continues.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy**

Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are grossly misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry.  Private companies that organize these visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger.  Iranian surrogacy providers have also been known to misrepresent U.S. citizenship law; if a child born overseas to a surrogate is not genetically or gestationally related to a U.S. citizen parent or the spouse of a U.S. citizen, the child will not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth and will not be able to obtain a U.S. passport to leave Iran.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) that bans U.S. flights to, from, or through Iran’s airspace.  This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Iran.   U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices for more information](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html) for additional information on travel to Iran.

**If you decide to travel to Iran:**

* Review your personal security plan and visit our website for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html).
* Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Iranian nationality.
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your loved ones to access them.
* Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones.  This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).
* Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones.  This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.  Review this [list](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html) of documents to prepare for your trip.
* Check local media for breaking events.  Be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/) to receive alerts from the Department. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel and return to the United States.
* Prepare a backup plan for emergency situations.  Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
