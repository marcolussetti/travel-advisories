**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road signs are limited and drivers often fail to yield to pedestrians, even at painted crosswalks.

Speeding and reckless driving are fairly common. Drivers can encounter nighttime drag racing on main thoroughfares and livestock on roads both day and night. Roads in Tortola's interior can be steep and extremely slippery when wet. Travelers planning to drive across the island should consider requesting four-wheel drive vehicles and should ensure that tires and brakes are in good operating condition on any rental vehicle.

**Traffic Laws:** Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. Seatbelts are required by law and cell phone use while driving is prohibited.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation consists of mini-buses and taxis.
