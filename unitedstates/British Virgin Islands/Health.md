**We do not pay medical bills**

* Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas. Doctors and hospitals will expect immediate cash payment for health services.
* Medical facilities in the British Virgin Islands do not meet U.S. standards. There is no hyperbaric chamber in the BVI.
* A volunteer organization, Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR), responds 24-hours to medical emergencies at sea or on the outer islands. VISAR transports casualties to the nearest point for transfer to ambulance. Reach VISAR at SOS (767) or call on Marine Channel 16.

**Medical Insurance**

* Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.
* If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [the British Virgin Islands](https://bvi.gov.vg/list-of-visitor-services) to ensure the medication is legal in the British Virgin Islands. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in the British Virgin Islands.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
