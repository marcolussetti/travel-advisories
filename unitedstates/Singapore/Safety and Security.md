**Crime:** In Singapore, you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you. Travelers should be aware of the following penalties for certain crimes in Singapore:

* Jaywalking, littering, or spitting - possible arrest
* Vandalism - mandatory caning (a form of physical punishment).
* Immigration violations - possible imprisonment, caning, or fines
* Drug-related crimes- severe penalties, including the death penalty or caning.
* Illegally possessing or carrying firearms, or committing crimes with firearms – severe penalties.
* Sex crimes or sexually inappropriate behavior – possible imprisonment, caning or fines. Lewd, unwanted behavior, including inappropriate comments, messages, or photography toward women who find it offensive may result in fines and imprisonment (“insulting the modesty of woman”). Laws regarding unwanted physical contact of any kind (“outrage of modesty,” molestation) are gender neutral, and punishments are generally more severe.
