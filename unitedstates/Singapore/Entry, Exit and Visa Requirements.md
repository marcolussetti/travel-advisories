# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

To enter Singapore, you need a passport that is valid for at least six months beyond the date of your intended stay. If you plan on regional travel beyond Singapore, make sure that your passport is valid for at least six months beyond the date you plan to enter other countries in the region. You do not need a visa for tourist or business visits up to 90 days.

Visit the [Embassy of Singapore](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/washington) website for the most current visa information.

All travelers are required to submit the SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with Electronic Health Declaration no more than three days (including the day of arrival) before arriving in Singapore, except: those transiting/transferring through Singapore without seeking immigration clearance; and residents travelling through the land checkpoints.

SGAC submission is free of charge. Please visit [Singapore’s immigration services website](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) to submit the SGAC.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Singapore. Foreign workers applying for an employment pass are required to undergo a medical screening for HIV/AIDS. A positive test will result in the rejection of a foreign worker’s application.

Please visit [the CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) for immunization information.
