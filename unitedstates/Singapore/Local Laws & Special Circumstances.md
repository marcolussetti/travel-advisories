# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, put in prison, or even caned. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

If you are suspected of consuming or possessing **illegal drugs**, police may:

* Conduct unannounced drug tests and property searches, including upon entry into Singapore
* Require you to provide a urine or blood sample on short notice
* A positive finding or an unwillingness to participate can lead to:
* Denial of entry into Singapore
* Detention
* Confiscation of your passport while under investigation

Singaporean authorities may arrest and convict any permanent residents of Singapore even if they have consumed illegal drugs outside of Singapore.

Singapore does not recognize dual nationality beyond the age of 22, and it strictly enforces universal national service for all male citizens and permanent residents. To determine if you will have a national service obligation, you should contact the [Ministry of Defense](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/).

**Drunk and disorderly conduct** can lead to a SG$1,000 fine or imprisonment. It is illegal to drink alcohol in a public place between 10:30 pm and 7:00 am. The areas of Geylang and Little India are designated as “Liquor Control Zones” where drinking in public places is prohibited all weekends, on public holidays, and on the eve of public holidays.

**Public Demonstrations:** Public demonstrations are legal only at Speakers’ Corner in Hong Lim Park, and most outdoor public assemblies require a police permit. Singapore amended its laws in April 2017 to forbid foreign nationals who are not permanent residents from observing permitted public demonstrations, assemblies, and processions at Speakers’ Corner. The law does not distinguish between participants and observers, so anyone at Speakers’ Corner could be considered part of an event. Penalties may be severe, including large fines and/or imprisonment.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** The Singapore Convention of Jehovah’s Witness and the Unification Church continue to be banned by the Singapore government. All written materials published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, publishing arms of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, remained banned by the government.

**LGB Travelers:** Singapore does not recognize same-sex unions. The Penal Code criminalizes any “act of gross indecency” between two men and prescribes a sentence not exceeding two years for those found guilty under this law. The Singaporean government has stated that it will not enforce this section of the Penal Code, but it remains on the statute books. The government issues permits for open air events that openly champion LGB issues on a limited basis, but new regulations restrict foreign involvement. LGB individuals may have difficulty gaining employment in certain sectors of the civil service. The [Ministry of Manpower](https://www.mom.gov.sg/) does not issue dependent passes (work permits) to partners in lesbian and gay relationships, even if legally married in another country.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Singapore has established a comprehensive code of standards for barrier-free accessibility, including facilities for persons with physical disabilities in all new buildings, and has mandated the progressive upgrading of older structures. The[Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)](https://www.msf.gov.sg/) is responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities and implementing programs and services in the disability sector.
