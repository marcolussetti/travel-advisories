# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic drives on the left in Turks and Caicos. Primary roads are in generally good condition, while secondary roads are often unpaved. Hazards such as blind intersections, road work, unmarked changes in road conditions, and a lack of familiarity with roundabouts may cause problems while driving. At a roundabout, drivers are required to give way to those on their immediate right and those who enter the roundabout first. Animals often wander on the roads, presenting a hazard to drivers, especially at night.

**Traffic Laws:** You need a valid driver’s license to drive in Turks and Caicos. A valid U.S. or [International Driving Permit](http://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) is good for up to a month, after that a local Turks and Caicos license from the [Department of Road Safety](https://gov.tc/dmv/) is required. Speed limits are 20 mph in town and side roads, and 40 mph on the highway. The use of seatbelts is mandatory. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal. Traffic accidents are on the rise and are often fatal. For emergencies, call 999 or 911 for police.

**Public Transportation:** There is no public transportation, but taxis are readily available. Only use marked taxis and wear your seatbelt. Car and scooter rentals are available but you must have a valid driver’s license and be 21 years or older. There is a government tax on all car and motor scooter rentals (insurance is extra).

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Turks and Caicos’ Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of TCI’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Turks and Caicos should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=ZH8vhpMLsRlhyYmGhsQmq712yBFWrSvYnnNWfPFbZHtddspH3KzQ!863626413!-1887722738?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).
