There are two hospital facilities on Providenciales and Grand Turk managed by InterHealth Canada that are able to handle non-life threatening medical needs. However, serious medical problems may require medical evacuation by air to neighboring countries or the United States.

The repatriation of the remains of U.S. citizens who die in Turks and Caicos can take weeks to return to the United States because Turks and Caicos does not always have a pathologist available to perform autopsies. Periodically-scheduled nonresident foreign pathologists often travel to Turks and Caicos to perform this public service.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare or Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medicines:** If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Government of Turks and Caicos](https://www.gov.tc/) to ensure the medication is legal in Turks and Caicos. Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
