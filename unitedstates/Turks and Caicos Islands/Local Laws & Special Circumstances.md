# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Firearms, Ammunition, and other weapons are not permitted in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI).**TCI authorities strictly enforce all firearm related laws; penalties include a minimum custodial sentence of twelve (12) years according to the [TCI Firearms Ordinance](https://www.gov.tc/agc/component/edocman/laws/revised/2014/18-09-firearms-ordinance-2?Itemid=). Declaring the weapon in your luggage with an airline carrier does not grant permission to bring the weapon into the Turks and Caicos Islands.

If a U.S. citizen illegally brings a firearm or ammunition into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the U.S. Embassy will not be able to secure their release.  All foreign nationals are subject to TCI law and must follow local law enforcement procedures. Please read more information on the Department of State’s page for Travelers With Firearms [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some offenses are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Nassau immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Penalties for possessing, using or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and/or heavy fines.
