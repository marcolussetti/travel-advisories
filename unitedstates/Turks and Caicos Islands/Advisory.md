***Updated to reflect information on traveling with firearms and ammunition.***

Exercise increased caution in the Turks and Caicos Islands due to **crime**.

**Country Summary:** Most crime occurs in Providenciales. Police may have limited investigatory resources. U.S. Embassy Nassau, located in The Bahamas, provides consular services (including assistance to victims of crime) for U.S. citizens in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Firearms and ammunition, **including single bullets brought by mistake in carry-on bags or luggage**, are illegal. **Police strictly enforce these laws,** even at the airport when travelers are leaving. Travelers face arrest, jail time, and heavy fines. Some U.S. citizens have been detained and unable to depart for several weeks or more after being found with bullets in their luggage. Offenders can face 12 years or more in prison. Though the law allows for some exceptions and discretion, the Department of State cannot guarantee your release.
