# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** American citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in the Eastern Caribbean islands. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the U.S., use the below personnel security measures while traveling:

* Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes.
* Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit locations.
* Go out in groups or with a companion and restrict nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues.
* Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers.
* Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes.
* Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash.
* Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police to report immediately.
* Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season.
* Use added caution when attending crowded events, celebrations, music festivals, etc.
* Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of “date rape” drugs in furtherance of criminal activity.
* Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules.
* Do not engage in illegal activity.

**\*Abide by the above security measures at all times, be aware of your surroundings in all areas, and use added vigilance while in isolated areas where tourists do not normally frequent.**

**Domestic Violence**

**Hurricanes:** Hurricane season generally runs from June through November, although hurricanes can occur outside that period. Monitor local weather reports closely.

**Tourism:**Regulation across the tourism industry varies, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not uniformly occur across all tourism operators. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. U.S. citizens are encouraged to discuss safety and security measures with tourism operators. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities or major tourism zones. First responders may be unable to access areas outside of major cities or major tourism zones.The ability to provide urgent medical treatment may be limited. Critical injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
