# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Public Demonstrations:**Demonstrations and rallies are common in South Korea, particularly near the U.S. Embassy, Seoul City Hall, and areas surrounding military installations. You should avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or rallies. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

**North Korea (The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, DPRK):**An armistice agreement, monitored by the United Nations, has maintained general peace on the Korean peninsula since 1953. Tensions occasionally flare up because of provocative acts by North Korea, including ballistic missile and nuclear tests and limited armed incursions into ROK-held territory. Some provocations have escalated into geographically limited skirmishes. South Korea routinely conducts military training exercises and civil defense drills. North Korea often issues strongly-worded and threatening messages, frequently in connection with these exercises. Please see our [Fact Sheet on North Korea](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2792.htm).

**Weather-related Events:** Heavy rains and flooding may occur during the June - August monsoon season or the May - November typhoon season. See general information about natural disaster preparedness at the U.S. [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/disaster) website.

If the Embassy becomes aware of any specific and credible threat to the safety and security of U.S. citizens, we will inform you through our website, social media, and email.

**Crime:** For most visitors, South Korea remains a very safe country. Common crimes occur more frequently in major metropolitan areas, tourist sites, and crowded markets.

* Take routine safety precautions.
* Pay attention to your surroundings.
* Report any concerns to local police.

Violent crime is not common; however, remain vigilant:

* Exercise caution in crowded entertainment, nightlife, and shopping districts.
* If traveling at night, consider traveling in groups.
* Use legitimate taxis or public transportation only.

**Victims of Crime:** Call 112 for emergency assistance or to report a crime to local authorities. Call 02-397-4114 to contact the U.S. Embassy. We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care;
* Assist you in reporting a crime to police;
* Contact relatives or friends on your behalf;
* Explain Korean judicial procedures in general terms;
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution;
* Help you find accommodations and flight arrangements to the United States;
* Replace a lost or stolen passport.

**Sexual Assault:** The Embassy regularly receives reports of sexual assault from U.S. citizens. Most cases involved young women assaulted by acquaintances they met on social media, dating, or messaging apps. Alcohol is often involved, and Korea’s low overall crime can create a false sense of security.  Specialized hospital units and police are available in South Korea to assist victims, however services in English and responsiveness to the crime are not always consistent. In general, sex crimes are not punished as harshly in South Korea as in the United States and the road to prosecution is a challenging one for victims.

**Domestic Violence:** Victim’s assistance resources or battered women’s shelters exist in Seoul and other urban areas but may be limited in rural areas. Most are government administered and require a police referral. Call 112 for emergency assistance or 1366 to reach Korea’s 24-hour domestic violence hotline. Victims may also contact the Embassy, tel. (+82) 2-397-4114.

**Lost or Stolen Passports:**If your passport is stolen, file a report at the nearest police station.

**Don't buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if widely available.** It is against South Korean law to purchase these goods and against U.S. law to bring them into the United States. The [Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) has more information.

**Avoid fraud and scams:** See [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety) websites for more information.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
