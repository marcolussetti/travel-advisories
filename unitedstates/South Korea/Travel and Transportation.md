**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads are well-paved, traffic signals functional, and most drivers comply with basic traffic laws. South Korea has a significantly higher traffic fatality rate than the United States. Causes of accidents include excessive speed, frequent lane changes without signaling, running red lights, aggressive bus drivers, and weaving motorcyclists. It is recommended that you photo document any traffic accidents.

Be aware that motorcyclists may drive on sidewalks, and drivers do not always yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks.

**Traffic Laws include:**

* International driving permit (or ROK license) is required for all drivers.
* Left-hand turns prohibited except with green arrow.
* Seat belts and car seats are mandatory.
* Motorcycle passengers must wear helmets.
* Automobile drivers are presumed to have some fault in accidents involving pedestrians.
* Expect long waits at police stations while police investigate any incidents.
* Police may take your passport or detain you during an investigation.
* Even if negligence is not proven, criminal charges may be filed.
* Blood-alcohol content of 0.03% or higher is considered legally intoxicated.
* Police regularly set up DUI checkpoints. Drivers are required to submit to breathalyzer tests; refusal can result in cancellation of your license.
