***Updated to reflect information on demonstrations and ongoing physician shortage.***

Exercise normal precautions when traveling to the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea).

**Advisory summary:** Large-scale demonstrations related to the domestic political situation may occur with little notice, potentially disrupting transportation and other essential services.

Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high. North Korea continues to conduct missile launches and other military activities that may increase tensions. Travelers should monitor local developments and remain vigilant. The South Korean government conducts civil emergency drills throughout the year.
