# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or focused on vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime**:  Street crime is a serious problem, and violent crime happens on a regular basis. Muggings and purse snatchings are known to occur along the beach at night and even during the day. Be aware of your surroundings, do not display large amounts of cash in public, avoid unlit areas at night, keep your car locked at all times, do not resist, and willingly hand over your possessions. The police and the military actively patrol the Ghana border due to higher crime levels. Although the border is open 24 hours, it should be avoided after dark.

**Vehicle Searches**:  At official checkpoints during night patrols, Togolese security officials prefer that you approach with your interior light on, headlights dimmed, and have your driver’s license and ID card ready. Police may inspect your car and look through the windows. Avoid giving your original passport to the police when possible. Solicitations for money or food should be ignored.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams**:  See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Togo. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offersBank overpayments

**Victims of Crime**:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 117 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (228) 22-61-54-70 and after hours at +(228) 90 25 84 78.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://tg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/victims-of-crime/).

We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.

**Domestic Violence**:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Local law does not specifically address domestic violence, and police generally do not intervene in abusive situations.

**Tourism:** Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not easily accessible in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Maritime Security**:  Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.
