# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. The U.S. Embassy will not intervene in private contract or family law disputes in Togo, and you must seek the recourse of the Togolese judicial system, even if you are a U.S. citizen.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://tg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information. The Government of Togo may refuse to recognize the U.S. citizenship of dual national Togolese citizens arrested in Togo.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: Local law forbids “acts against nature committed with an individual of one’s sex,” widely understood to mean same-sex sexual activity. If you are convicted of engaging in consensual same-sex sexual activity, you may be imprisoned and/or fined. However, the U.S. Embassy has not witnessed Togolese prosecutions against U.S. citizens for same-sex activity to date.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: The Togolese government does not mandate accessibility to public or private facilities for persons with disabilities, although some buildings may have ramps and wider entrance ways.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**: Women travelling alone are encouraged to take similar precautions as they would in any large U.S. city while in the country. Travel in groups and be extra vigilant after dark, particularly in the beach and central market areas of Lomé.
