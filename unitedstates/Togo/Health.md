Togo no longer requires documentation related to COVID-19 (such as proof of vaccination, negative PCR test, or antigen test when entering or exiting Togo.

However, it is recommended to passengers, when leaving Togo, to verify the current COVID-19 requirements in their destination country to ensure compliance.

Travelers aged 12 and up are encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to observe health precautions.

Medical facilities and services in Togo are severely limited, including in the major cities of Lomé and Kara. The standard of care, including basic medical services, such as imaging or blood tests, is much lower than that of the United States and even neighboring Ghana. If you have a recurring or limiting medical condition that requires regular consultation or treatment by a medical professional, you should not travel to Togo.

You should carry adequate supplies of any needed prescription medicines, along with copies of your prescriptions, the generic name of the drugs, and a supply of preferred over-the-counter medications. You may encounter shortages of routine medications, and supplies and counterfeit medications are a frequent problem.

Refer to the CDC website for [health information for travelers to Togo](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/togo).

For emergency services in Togo, dial:

* Police – 117
* Gendarmerie – 172
* Fire (sapeurs pompiers) – 118
* Main Lomé Hospital Sylvanus Olympio – 22 21 25 01 (most suitable for trauma)
* Embassy’s Duty Officer – 90 25 84 78
* Ambulance services are:
  + not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
  + Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. The Togolese government does not maintain a website with prohibited medications, but usually if the medication is legal in France, it is legal in Togo.

**Vaccinations**:  Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health Facilities in General**:

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not available.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals**:

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescriptions in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states)websites for more information.

**Non-Traditional Medicine**:

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Togo. Ensure that you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Water Quality**:

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
* Do not swim or bathe in or drink fresh or brackish water in streams, rivers, waterfalls, or lakes in Togo. Both Guinea Worm and Schistosomiasis are common in Togo, and contracted primarily through exposure to fresh water, even if the body of water is fast moving or is partially salty.

**Adventure Travel**:

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-the-extreme).
* Most adventure travel in Togo involves the ocean – swimming, whale watching, fishing, surfing, and wind surfing. Travelers coming to Togo for ocean-based recreation should use caution when engaging in these activities in a new area. The undertow is extremely strong, particularly from January to May, across the entire Bight of Benin, which includes Ghana, Benin and Togo. Water depths are variable, and water that may appear shallow near the coast can suddenly deepen due to variations in sand or wave formations. Togo has no emergency capability to respond to swimmers in distress, near drownings, or stranded or capsized vessels.

**General Health**:

The following diseases are prevalent:

* [Malaria](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/malaria)
* [Yellow Fever](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/yellow-fever)
* [Typhoid](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/typhoid)
* [Dengue](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/dengue)
* [Travelers’ Diarrhea](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/travelers-diarrhea)
* [Rabies](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rabies)
* [Meningococcal Meningitis](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/meningococcal-disease)
* [Tuberculosis](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/tuberculosis)
* [Schistosomiasis](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/schistosomiasis)
* Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – recommended mosquito repellents, and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. Travelers should carry their own mosquito repellent according to CDC recommendations. The Embassy cannot guarantee the quality and the side effects of the repellent products available locally.

**Air Quality**:  The air quality in Togo varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  During the annual harmattan season, when winds blow dust in from the Sahel, followed by a subsequent burn season, when farmers routinely burn their fields, air quality can reach hazardous levels in Togo (Dec- Feb).  Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
