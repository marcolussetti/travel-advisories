**Do Not Travel To:**

* Northern border region due to **terrorism**.

**Country Summary:**  Crime continues to be a major public security concern in Côte d’Ivoire. Violent crime, such as carjacking, robbery, and home invasion, is common in some areas.  Local police often lack resources to respond to serious crimes.

Violent extremist activity occurs in Burkina Faso and Mali near the border with Côte d’Ivoire.  Terrorism concerns in the northern region remain due to its proximity to these countries.

Travelers should avoid demonstrations, protests, political rallies, and large crowds.  These events can become violent.  Demonstrators and security forces may clash suddenly.  Police may use tear gas or other force to break up crowds.

Piracy with armed robbery and kidnapping for ransom are significant threats to ships operating near Côte d’Ivoire.  U.S. citizens on ships in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of West Africa should be cautious.

Health care in rural areas is below U.S. standards.  There are often shortages of medicine and medical supplies in public and private health facilities.

The U.S. government is limited in its ability to provide emergency assistance to U.S. citizens outside Abidjan.  U.S. Embassy staff are not permitted to drive outside major cities at night.  Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CotedIvoire.html) for more information on travel to Côte d’Ivoire.

**Northern Border Region – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

The main terrorist threat to Côte d’Ivoire is from a group called Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM is linked to al-Qa’ida. JNIM mostly operates in the Sahel region, including Burkina Faso and Mali.  The threat from JNIM has in the past reached northern Côte d’Ivoire, near the border with Burkina Faso.  Attacks have happened in the Savanes and Zanzan Districts, including Comoé National Park.  These attacks have mainly targeted Ivoirian security forces, but civilians have also been targeted.  In 2021, Al-Qa’ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) carried out 17 small-scale attacks that killed approximately 20 people.  After these attacks, the Côte d’Ivoire government increased security in northern Côte d’Ivoire.  Since 2021, there have been no attacks.
