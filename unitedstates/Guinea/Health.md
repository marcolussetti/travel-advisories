Medical facilities are poorly equipped and extremely limited, both in the capital city and throughout Guinea. Medicines are in short supply and of questionable quality, with counterfeiting of medication a serious issue. Sterility of equipment should not be assumed, and treatment is frequently unreliable. Some private medical facilities provide a better range of treatment options than public facilities but are still well below western standards. Trauma care is extremely limited. Food and water safety concerns are among the most common causes of illnesses in the country. Sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, are common.

For emergency services in Guinea, dial 117.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation from Guinea to Europe or the United States can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

If traveling with prescription medication, always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

[Malaria](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/malaria) is prevalent throughout the country. Antimalarial prophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

You should:

* Carry and use insect repellents containing either 20 percent DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon, eucalyptus, or IR3535.
* Treat clothing and tents with permethrin.
* Sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.
* Use antimalarial prophylaxis.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in Conakry, Guinea. Consider the potential impact of seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution on your health and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season, which begins in late October and continues into late May. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Guinea.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
