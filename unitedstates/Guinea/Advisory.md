*Updated to reflect change in Travel Advisory from a Level 3 to a Level 2 and removing the “E” (time-limited event) indicator related to the catastrophic 2023 fuel depot explosion and its after-effects.*

Exercise increased caution in Guinea due to **crime**, **civil unrest**, and **inadequate health infrastructure**.

**Country Summary:**There is considerable risk of crimes of opportunity in Guinea, especially in Conakry, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft of valuables from vehicles, assaults, and residential burglaries. Travelers should be especially alert in crowded areas where people congregate, such as markets.

**Demonstrations** and **protests** occur unpredictably in Guinea and occasionally result in violence. If traveling outside the Conakry peninsula, make all efforts to complete your travel before nightfall. There are increased safety hazards and security concerns at night. U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission authority are restricted from traveling between cities after dark and are unable to provide emergency services at night.

Guinea’s **health infrastructure** is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Local drinking water is unsafe, pharmacies are not well regulated, locally available medications may be unsafe, and necessary healthcare may not be available.
