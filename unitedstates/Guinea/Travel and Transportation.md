# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Border Crossings**: Most border crossings are controlled jointly by Guinean armed forces, gendarmes, police, and immigration officials, but are lightly patrolled. Complete paperwork and visas are required to cross land borders.

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Guinea’s road network, which is only partially paved, is underdeveloped and unsafe. Roads and vehicles are poorly maintained, road signs are insufficient, and roads and vehicles are frequently unlit. Livestock and pedestrians create constant road hazards. These conditions worsen after dark. During the rainy season, generally from May to October, flash floods can make some roads temporarily impassable. The police and the military often set up roadblocks, making travel within and between cities difficult from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

Drivers and passengers of vehicles involved in accidents resulting in injury or death have experienced extra-judicial actions (i.e., mob attacks), official consequences such as fines and incarceration, and/or confrontations with the victim’s family.

Avoid traveling after dark outside of populated areas due to the risk of roadside crime, roadblocks, and road hazards. Roadside assistance is not available in Guinea.

**Traffic Laws**: Drivers in Guinea are generally unaware of traffic laws and routinely ignore road safety rules.

**Public Transportation**: Guinea has no reliable, safe public transportation. Taxis, including small cars and larger vans, are poorly maintained and overcrowded. Taxis frequently stop and start without regard to other vehicles, drive down the wrong side of the road, and weave in and out of lanes. Motorcycles overwhelm the roads and are dangerous to riders and other vehicles and pedestrians. Hired vehicles and drivers are available from agencies at major hotels in Conakry.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel**: Mariners planning travel to Guinea should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website,](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
