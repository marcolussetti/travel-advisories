# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Guinea are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. It is common for criminal cases to take months, if not years, to reach a verdict.

U.S. citizens have been arrested for assault after fighting with police officers who stopped them for questioning. If you are stopped by the police, follow their instructions and request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately.

U.S. citizens have been arrested or detained for non-payment of local debts to individuals and businesses.

U.S. citizens have been arrested or detained for illegal import/export activities related to mining products.

The U.S. Embassy cannot represent you, pay your legal costs, pay your debts, provide legal advice, or get you out of jail.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Dual Nationality**: If you hold Guinean nationality in addition to U.S. nationality, and are arrested or detained in Guinea, the Guinean government is not required to provide notification or access to the U.S. Embassy. However, Embassy personnel will request access should we learn of an arrest. Find more information on travelers with dual nationality here <https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html>.

**Customs**: Guinean customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the temporary import or export of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, mining products, and ivory. Some items may require a special export permit. You should contact the [Embassy of Guinea in Washington](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Guinea.html#ExternalPopup), DC for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Currency**: The local currency is the Guinean franc (GNF). Travelers may not depart Guinea carrying more than 100,000 GNF (currently about $11.00 USD) or more than $5,000 USD or the equivalent in Euros. Guinea has a cash economy. ATMs are available and credit cards are accepted at some larger hotels and larger supermarkets in Conakry, but should be used only at reputable hotels, stores, and banks. Cash advances on Visa credit cards are available at various branches of BICIGUI, a local bank. Inter-bank fund transfers are possible at BICIGUI branches but can be difficult and expensive. Money transfers from the United States have worked successfully in the past. Western Union has numerous offices in Conakry and throughout Guinea, and MoneyGram also has an office in downtown Conakry.

**Photography**: Visitors should restrict photography to private gatherings and should obtain explicit permission from the Guinean government before photographing military and transportation facilities, government buildings, or public works. Photographing without permission in any public area may result in arrest or a dangerous confrontation with people who find being photographed offensive.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Guinea. Penalties include fines and jail time of up to three years in prison.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in education, employment, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of government services. However, the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be extremely limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. These limitations are notable across the country.

* *Travelers with disabilities should make careful arrangements prior to travel for any necessary equipment, devices, or service providers as these are generally unavailable in Guinea.*

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**: Rape, spousal rape, and domestic violence are all crimes in Guinea punishable with fines or imprisonment. However, these crimes are common and underreported. Indictments are rare and police are unlikely to intervene.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is illegal. However, abundant evidence exists that FGM/C is still being practiced despite the ban.
