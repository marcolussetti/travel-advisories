# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime**: Burglaries and break-ins are common, as are purse snatchings and other street robberies. Many robberies occur in taxis. Follow routine personal security considerations such as locking doors, windows, and employ security alarms. U.S. citizen employees of the Embassy are prohibited from using local taxis.

Motorists have occasionally encountered improvised checkpoint barricades manned by uniformed military or police personnel who demand money and search through personal belongings, confiscating items of value. See Victims of Crime section to report incidents.

Do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport or hotels as these individuals may be seeking opportunities to rob visitors of their bags, purses, or wallets. You should arrange to be met at the airport by hotel personnel or business contacts.

Keep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Soldiers staffing checkpoints at night and police at intersections during the day will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.

**Demonstrations**: Political tensions remain high since the 2021 military coup.  Protests around governance, utility and fuel problems, and labor disputes are common, causing disruptions to traffic and commerce.  Some prior protests have escalated into violence.  Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents.

You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.

**Scams**: See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

Commercial scams are on the rise and can create legal difficulties for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens have reported being detained by local authorities based on complaints by local business partners and/or as an attempt to extract additional payment. Scams can also target private business personnel and non-governmental organization employees, often with offers to sell diamonds or gold. In general, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The funds cannot be recovered.

Other common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy.

Report crimes in person at the nearest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(224) 655-10-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.
