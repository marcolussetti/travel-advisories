**For emergency services in Georgia, dial 112** (the equivalent of 911 in the United States)

**Ambulance services** are not widely available outside Tbilisi and training and availability of emergency responders may fall below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**Limited Medical Services in Rural Areas:**In the event of injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. **U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.** See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html "Insurance Providers for Overseas Coverage").

**We do not pay for medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most health care providers in Georgia only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) website for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription**.** Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.ge/en/) to ensure the medication is legal in Georgia**. Georgia strictly regulates types and quantities of prescription medications that may be brought into the country.** **Travelers carrying prohibited prescription drugs have been detained and face heavy fines or arrest.**

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Georgia.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution is a significant problem in Tbilisi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if necessary. Georgia has installed and maintains air quality monitors around the country. Real-time data is available at: <https://air.gov.ge/en/>.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health Facilities in General:**

* Adequate healthcare facilities are available in Tbilisi, although below U.S. standards. Outside major cities, medical facilities in Georgia are limited.
* **Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.** Credit card payment is not always available.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Georgia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* **The Georgian government has announced it intends to pass legislation that would ban surrogacy for foreigners starting January 1, 2024.** Breaking the law will be a criminal offense. Currently, the law is in draft form and several issues related to surrogacy services, including if and how pre-existing contracts with ART facilities and surrogates in Georgia would be honored, will not be known until the law is passed. You might not be able to receive a refund if you enter into a contract for surrogacy services. Babies born through illegal arrangements might be prevented from leaving Georgia. Before you commit to a surrogacy arrangement, seek independent legal advice. [A list of local attorneys](https://ge.usembassy.gov/legal-assistance/) in Georgia who have expressed interest in assisting U.S. citizens can be found on Embassy Tbilisi’s website.
