**For emergency services in Georgia, dial 112** (the equivalent of 911 in the United States).

Ambulance services are rare outside Tbilisi. Training and the number of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital. They do this rather than wait for an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/georgia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) webpage and general Traveler Advice for [Georgia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/georgia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.

**Limited Medical Services in Rural Areas:**Medical services are limited in rural areas. If you are injured, treatment is usually only available in or near major cities. First responders usually can't access rural areas. They also can't provide urgent medical care there.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Check that your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most health care providers in Georgia only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) website for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**We strongly recommend**[**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)**to cover medical evacuation.**

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, with your doctor’s prescription**.** Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.ge/index.php?lang=1) to ensure the medication is legal in Georgia**. Georgia strictly regulates types and quantities of prescription medications that can be brought into the country.** **Travelers carrying prohibited prescription drugs have been detained and faced heavy fines or arrest.**

**Vaccinations:** Get all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of English-speaking doctors](https://ge.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) and hospitals in Georgia.  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution is a significant problem in Tbilisi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if necessary. Georgia has installed and maintains air quality monitors around the country. Real-time data is available at: <https://air.gov.ge/en/>.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Georgia.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).

**Health Facilities in General:**

* Adequate healthcare facilities are available in Tbilisi, although below U.S. standards. Outside major cities, medical facilities in Georgia are limited.
* **Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.** Credit card payment is not always available.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Hospital “emergency rooms” may not be capable of dealing with significant trauma events, nor may they provide all services 24/7.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy:**

If you are considering traveling to Georgia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology or surrogacy, we strongly encourage you to read our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

* **Please contact the U.S. Embassy at** [**AskConsulTbilisi@state.gov**](mailto:AskConsulTbilisi@state.gov) ***two* *months* in advance of your intended departure** **with your newborn** to prepare for and secure a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) and passport appointment.
* **We cannot confirm a CRBA or passport appointment until you are in possession of a valid local birth certificate.**
* Some families who have traveled to Georgia for ART or surrogacy services in the past two years have experienced **extensive delays** **of up to nine months** to return to the United States with their newborn.

**Please be advised that the Georgian Ministry of Health was unable to provide Embassy Tbilisi with a comprehensive list of all fertility clinics operating - ostensibly under its oversight - in Georgia. The Ministry of Health also could not provide Embassy Tbilisi with the requirements to register as a licensed fertility clinic here.**

Clerical errors by surrogacy agencies have significantly delayed local birth certificate issuance until the family’s case passes through the Georgian court system. Per local law, children born via IVF/surrogacy cannot exit Georgia unless the local birth certificate is issued by the House of Justice, which is verified by the border police at departure.

Some families have reported significant unexpected/unplanned costs associated with these delays and with their ART/surrogacy agencies’ services. Some families have reported pre-arranged contracted services with some agencies not being what was promised when delivered in Georgia. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene on the behalf of U.S. citizens in Georgian legal proceedings associated with ART, surrogacy, or any other private matters.

Finally, some clinics in Tbilisi have been the subject of high-profile criminal investigations related to egg harvesting and mistreatment of surrogates. We recommend families conduct extensive reviews of Georgian ART, surrogacy, and health providers.

**Other:**

* Travelers with **existing health problems** may be at risk because of inadequate medical facilities.
* There is a significant risk of**rabies**in Georgia. The CDC recommends some travelers complete the [rabies vaccine](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/georgia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) series prior to arriving in country.
* Some spices made in Georgia contain high levels of lead. Buy spices only from recognized U.S. or international makers.
* Georgia has a high rate of Hepatitis C. Be careful if you plan to get a tattoo, piercing, dental work, or other procedure that exposes you to blood. Ensure the provider uses proper sterilization procedures.
* Ensure food is cooked thoroughly to reduce the risk of **food-borne illness.**
* **Georgia has eight venomous snake** species that are active between March and October. Few medical facilities have antivenin serum. **Treat all snakes as potentially venomous.**

**Tuberculosis** is prevalent in Georgia. Visit the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Georgia.
