# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: **You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be fined, arrested, deported, or imprisoned.** Individuals establishing a business or praticing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

If arrested, you may be held in pre-trial detention for up to nine months. Review the State Department’s page on [Arrests or Detention of U.S Citizens Abroad.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html)

Furthermore, some lawsare also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://ge.usembassy.gov/contact/)for further information.

Notification to U.S. Embassy Tbilisi of the arrest of U.S. citizens is typically significantly delayed in Georgia. In addition, the Georgian police have the authority under the Administration Violation Code to detain individuals for up to 24 hours without court intervention and 48 hours with court approval (this is referred to as “administrative detention”). There are no due process rights assigned during an administrative hold, meaning the person has no right to counsel.

**Special Circumstances**: Georgia has strict regulations concerning:

* **Possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs** in accordance with Georgian laws and controlled substance classifications. **Penalties are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.**
* The import or export of alcohol, tobacco, jewelry, religious materials, art or artifacts, antiquities, and business equipment.
* **Export of items of historical value**, such as artwork, antiques, jewelry, or paintings. You must obtain a license. Contact the [Embassy of Georgia](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Georgia.html#ExternalPopup) or see our [customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) webpage.
* **Firearms** cannot be imported into Georgia.
* Georgian law prohibits the **sale of real property** (land and houses) in the occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Prior owners may have the right to reclaim the property in the future.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. If you attempt to bring counterfeit or pirated goods into the United States you may incur a fine or have the items seized. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

* [Faith-Based Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/faith-based-travel.html)
* [International Religious Freedom Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/rpt/index.htm) – see country reports

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex sexual conduct or the organization of LGB events in Georgia. However, traditional cultural attitudes result in LGB individuals often facing discrimination and harassment. Some LGB persons in Georgia have been targets of attacks. In addition, violent anti-LGB protests have occurred in Tbilisi, including in response to public LGB related events.

See our [LGB travel information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of the [Department of State’s Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: Georgian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the government does not enforce the law effectively. In July 2020, Georgia adopted legislation on the rights of persons with disabilities that establishes principles to guide the government’s implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The government has until this year (2023) to develop an implementation action plan and 15 years to complete accessibility of government buildings, infrastructure, and services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. **Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.**
