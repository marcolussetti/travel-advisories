# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: **You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be fined, arrested, deported, or imprisoned**. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://ge.usembassy.gov/) for further information.

**Notification to U.S. Embassy Tbilisi of the arrest of U.S. citizens is typically significantly delayed in Georgia.** In addition, the Georgian police have the authority under the Administration Violation Code to detain individuals for up to 24 hours without court intervention and 48 hours with court approval (this is referred to as “administrative detention”). There are no due process rights assigned during an administrative hold, meaning the person has no right to counsel.

If arrested, you may be held in pre-trial detention for up to nine months. Review the State Department’s page on [Arrests or Detention of U.S Citizens Abroad.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html)

**Special Circumstances**: Georgia has strict regulations concerning:

* **Possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs**. **Penalties are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.**
* The import or export of alcohol, tobacco, jewelry, religious materials, art or artifacts, antiquities, and business equipment.
* **Export of items of historical value**, such as artwork, antiques, jewelry, or paintings. You must obtain a license from the [Minister of Education, Science, Culture and Sport](http://www.mes.gov.ge/). Contact the [Embassy of Georgia](https://ge.usembassy.gov/) or see our [customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) webpage.
* **Firearms** cannot be imported into Georgia.
* Georgian law prohibits the **sale of real property** (land and houses) in the occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Prior owners may have the right to reclaim the property in the future.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. If you attempt to bring counterfeit or pirated goods into the United States, you may incur a fine or have the items seized. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** Consensual same-sex conduct is legal in Georgia, although the government recently passed legislation that outlaws so-called “gay and lesbian propaganda.” This includes barring: same-sex couples from adopting, sex change surgery, distribution of pro-gay and lesbian materials, and gay and lesbian-related public gatherings (see below). Traditional cultural attitudes result in gay and lesbian individuals often facing discrimination and harassment. Some gay and lesbian persons in Georgia have been targets of attacks. Violent anti-gay and lesbian protests have occurred in Tbilisi, including in response to public gay and lesbian-related events.

On December 1, 2024, a new law “[*On the Protection of Family Values and Minors*](https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/6283110?publication=0)” entered into force in Georgia. The law restricts speech about trans-gender rights, same-sex relationships, and incest. The law:

* Bans teaching or talking about these topics in educational programs and places.
* Bans showing ads, broadcasts, or sharing anything about these topics with minors.
* Bans public events that support or talk about these topics.
* Defines marriage as only between a man and a woman, doesn’t allow same-sex unions to be registered or recognized as marriage, and does not recognize such unions from other countries.
* Doesn’t allow someone to adopt a child if they don’t identify as their biological sex, identify as a different sex than they were born, or aren’t heterosexual.

See our [Gay and Lesbian travel information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and Section 6 of the [Department of State’s Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: Georgian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the government does not enforce the law effectively. In July 2020, Georgia adopted a law on the rights of persons with disabilities. The law sets principles to guide the government's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In 2023, the Government of Georgia approved an Action Plan for the Protection of Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which imposes obligations to complete accessibility of government buildings, infrastructure, and services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. **Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.**
