Exercise normal precautions in Georgia. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel To:**

* The Russian-occupied Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia due to risk of **crime, civil unrest,** and **landmines**.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Georgia.html) for additional information on travel to Georgia.

If you decide to travel to Georgia:

* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) (STEP) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Georgia/Detail) for Georgia.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel and return to the United States.
* We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel.  Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.

**South Ossetia and Abkhazia – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Russian troops and border guards occupy both South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions.  The precise locations of administrative boundary lines are difficult to identify.  Entering these areas could lead to arrest, imprisonment, or a fine. Violent attacks and criminal incidents occur in the region.  Landmines are a danger to travelers near the boundary lines of both territories.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Georgia are prohibited from traveling to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Do not travel to these areas for any reason.
