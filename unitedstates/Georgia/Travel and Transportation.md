# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Road conditions in Georgia differ significantly from those in the United States. Many roads are in poor condition with stretches of road missing pavement and having large potholes. **Driving at night** can be dangerous due to varying road and traffic conditions, poor lighting, and the presence of open range livestock.

* **Avoid traveling at night.** U.S. Embassy official travel at night outside of urban areas is prohibited, except for emergencies.
* **Exercise caution when driving in Georgia at all times**. Reckless driving is common, and drivers frequently ignore traffic laws.
* **Be careful when crossing streets, as pedestrians are not given right-of-way**.
* **Winter travel can also be hazardous**, especially in mountainous areas.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the right. Speed limits range from 80 to 110 km/hr. (50 to 69 m/hr.) on highways and 30 to 70 km/hr. (19 to 44 m/hr.) on urban thoroughfares. Motorists are not permitted to make right turns at red traffic lights.

* Wear seat belts when driving. **Children under four** must travel in child-safety seats. **Children under twelve** may not ride in the front seat.
* **There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol**. Anything above a blood alcohol content of 0.0% is illegal.
* Vehicle safety inspections are being phased in since January 2018, but there are still many vehicles on the road in poor condition or lacking basic features such as working lights.
* The Georgian Patrol Police maintain traffic safety in Georgia, but enforcement of traffic regulations is inconsistent.

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation, while inexpensive, may be unreliable and uncomfortable.  Minibuses (“marshrutkas”) are often overcrowded, poorly maintained, lack seat belts, and are frequently involved in accidents.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) and the website of the [Georgian National Tourism Agency](https://gnta.ge/)for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Georgia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Georgia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Georgia.html#ExternalPopup).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Georgia should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
