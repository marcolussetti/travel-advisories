# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Road conditions in Georgia differ significantly from those in the United States. Many roads are in poor condition with stretches of road missing pavement and having large potholes. Driving at night can be dangerous due to varying road and traffic conditions, poor lighting or lack of headlights, and the presence of open range livestock in the road.

**Avoid traveling at night.** U.S. Embassy official travel at night outside of urban areas is prohibited, except for emergencies.

* **Exercise caution when driving in Georgia at all times**. Reckless driving is common, and drivers frequently ignore traffic laws.
* **Be careful when crossing streets, as pedestrians are not given right-of-way**.
* **Winter travel can also be hazardous**, especially in mountainous areas.
* **Snow tires** or chains are required on all vehicles traveling in mountainous terrain during the winter.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the right. Speed limits range from 80 to 110 kmph (50 to 69 mph) on highways and 30 to 70 kmph (19 to 44 mph) on urban thoroughfares. Motorists are not permitted to make right turns at red traffic lights.

* Wear seat belts when driving. **Children under four** must travel in child-safety seats. **Children under twelve** may not ride in the front seat.
* **There is zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol**. Anything above a blood alcohol content of 0.0% is illegal.
* Georgia began inspecting vehicles for safety in 2018, but there are still many vehicles on the road in poor condition.
* The Georgian Patrol Police maintain traffic safety in Georgia. They do not consistently enforce traffic rules.

**Public Transportation**: Public transit is cheap, but may be unreliable and uncomfortable. Minibuses, called "marshrutkas," are often overcrowded, poorly maintained, lack seat belts, and are often in accidents. U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from riding in marshrutkas.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Georgia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Georgia should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
