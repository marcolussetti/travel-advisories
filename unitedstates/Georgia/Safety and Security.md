# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations continue to plot possible attacks throughout Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas:**The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, de facto local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around the areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. Follow the guidance in our [**Travel Advisory for Georgia**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/georgia-travel-advisory.html) and **do not travel** **to these regions.** If you choose to travel there, you should be aware:

* U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia or South Ossetia. **We are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in either territory.**U.S. government employees also are restricted from traveling within five kilometers of the administrative boundary line (ABL) dividing these regions from Tbilisi-administered territory.
* The administrative boundary line (ABL) of South Ossetia is not clearly marked in many places and frequently moving in other places. **There is an elevated risk of wandering into South Ossetia unknowingly while hiking, particularly on the ABL’s eastern side**, which could result in detention by security forces.
* Unexploded ordnance left over from previous conflicts pose a danger near the administrative boundary line of South Ossetia.
* You may only legally enter these regions from the Georgian side, per Georgian law.
* **You may be arrested, detained, imprisoned, and/or fined by Russian, Georgian or *de facto* authorities if you enter without proper documentation.**
* Medical services in the occupied territories are extremely limited. Hospitals do not accept credit cards or medical insurance, have little to no infectious disease control, and lack medicine.
* There are no commercial airports in either region making air ambulance evacuations impossible during medical emergencies.
* It is illegal to undertake any type of economic activity in Abkhazia or South Ossetia that requires permits, licenses, or registration, per Georgian law. Laws also ban mineral exploration, money transfers, and international transit via Abkhazia or South Ossetia.

**Pankisi Gorge:** The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk) because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest. There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to this region or within five kilometers of it. While the Georgian government has had success in combating terrorism within its borders, U.S. citizens should remain vigilant. ISIS recruiting has occurred in Pankisi in the past, and some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region.

**Crime**: Criminals may target foreigners. Take precautions against becoming a victim of crime as you would in any large city.

* **Firearms** are readily available in Georgia, assailants may be armed, and disputes with firearms could occur.
* **Alcohol consumption** is prevalent and has been attributed to escalating or exacerbating otherwise minor disputes.
* **Carrying pocket knives or other cutting devices in Georgia is illegal under most circumstances**.  You may be detained or cited if found in violation.
* There has been an increase in reports of “**confidence scams”** where a traveler who orders drinks or food in a bar or restaurant is presented with a bill for exorbitantly high sums and then physically threatened if they do not pay. These are sometimes combined with “**romance scams**” wherein a traveler is taken to these establishments by someone they met online through a dating or other social meetup site.
* U.S. and other visitors have reported occurrences of **sexual assault** in Georgia.
* **Avoid walking alone at night**.
* **Exercise caution** when riding alone in private taxis or “marshrutka” mini buses.
* Maintain a low profile, do not carry large amounts of cash, and do not draw unnecessary attention to yourself.
* Use caution at **ATMs**, and always check for skimming devices or other tampering.
* Avoid using **public WIFI networks or internet terminals** as they did not protect your data or personal information.
* **Foreign visitors report having items stolen from locked hotel rooms.** Review additional information on crime threats in the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) [Georgia Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Georgia/Content/Detail/Report/fa87e38f-15ab-45fc-b791-1d145986975e).

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredicatable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
  + Security alerts about demonstrations can be found on the Embassy’s website [here](https://ge.usembassy.gov/).

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112, and contact the [U.S. Embassy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/contact/) in Tbilisi at (+ 995) (32) 227-7724 (after hours + 995 32 227-7000).

The [Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs](https://police.ge/en/home)(MOIA) operates a 24-hour emergency response center similar to 911 (dial 112) and transfers emergency calls to the fire and rescue service, police, or the nearest medical emergency center. Most dispatchers speak only Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.

**Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.**The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement or legal authority overseas, nor can it investigate crimes in Georgia. U.S. embassy staff are prohibited by federal regulation from acting as agents, attorneys, or in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of U.S. citizens involved in legal disputes overseas.

These may be available through a government agency known as [Atipfund Georgia](https://atipfund.moh.gov.ge).

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are not routine. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by host government orby recognized authorities in the field. . In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

**Personal Safety in Remote Areas:** If you intend to **camp**, **climb**, or **hike** in the mountains or any remote area in Georgia:

* Research local conditions in advance.
* Go with a companion or a group. Avoid traveling alone.
* Provide route and contact information to someone not traveling with you.
* Maintain communication with your family and friends.
* If in trouble, call the emergency number 112. Most dispatchers speak Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.
