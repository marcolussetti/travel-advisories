# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations continue to plot possible attacks throughout Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Georgia’s proximity to Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and the Russian North Caucasus region (all of which have experienced some measure of recent terrorist-related activity) continues to be of concern. While Georgia has made strides with respect to border control and integrity, its geographic location makes it a natural transit area for individuals from these regions. Foreign fighters from Georgia, or who transited Georgia, have joined ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.

Terrorist recruiting has occurred in the Pankisi Gorge area of Georgia in the past. Some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region. Georgia substantially updated and expanded its counterterrorism legislation in 2015. In 2018, authorities detained, prosecuted, and sentenced several Georgian nationals affiliated with Chechen ISIS member Akhmet Chataev, following his death in a 2017 counterterrorism operation. Operations in Tbilisi and Pankisi led to the detention and conviction of eight individuals on terrorism charges.

**Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas:**The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, *de facto* local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around these areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. **Follow the guidance in our**[**Travel Advisory for Georgia**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/georgia-travel-advisory.html)**and do not travel to these regions.** If you choose to travel there, you should be aware:

* **U.S. Embassy personnel are not permitted to travel within five kilometers of the Administrative Boundary Lines (ABLs) dividing Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Tbilisi-administered territory unless on approved official business and with the use of a fully armored vehicle. Personal travel on major highways within the five-kilometer border zone is not restricted.** These lines divide the regions from territory administered by the Georgian government.
* South Ossetia's administrative boundary line (ABL) is not clearly marked in many places and has and can be moved. **Hikers risk accidentally wandering into South Ossetia, particularly on the ABL’s eastern side.** This could result in detention by Russian security forces.
* There are dangerous unexploded weapons from past conflicts near the administrative boundary line of South Ossetia.
* Per Georgian law, you can only enter these regions from the Georgian-administered side, not from Russia.
* **If you enter without proper documentation, you may be arrested, detained, imprisoned, and/or fined**.
* Medical services in the occupied territories are very limited. Hospitals do not accept credit cards or medical insurance. They have little to no infectious disease control and lack medicine.
* Air ambulance evacuations are impossible because there are no commercial airports in either region.
* It is illegal to undertake any type of economic activity in Abkhazia or South Ossetia that requires permits, licenses, or registration, per Georgian law. Laws also ban mineral exploration, money transfers, and international transit via Abkhazia or South Ossetia.

**Pankisi Gorge:**The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk). There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to the Pankisi Gorge region because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest.

**Crime**: Criminals may target foreigners. Take precautions against becoming a victim of crime as you would in any large city.

* **Alcohol consumption** is prevalent and may escalate otherwise minor disputes.
* **Carrying pocketknives or other cutting devices in Georgia is illegal**.  You may be detained or cited if found in violation.
* **“Confidence” and “romance” schemes.** Refuse invitations from strangers to come into bars or nightclubs. These ploys lure individuals into bars, where hustlers extort travelers for large amounts of cash, threatening physical harm if the travelers refuse to pay for exorbitantly priced drinks. There are reports of criminals using dating apps to lure unsuspecting individuals to locations that coordinate with the “date” to take advantage of the victim by extorting money. These scams are common, and the Embassy advises caution.
* U.S. and other visitors have reported occurrences of **sexual assault** in Georgia.
* **Avoid walking alone at night**.
* **Be careful** when riding alone in private taxis or “marshrutka” minibuses.
* **Keep a low profile.** Do not carry lots of cash. Do not draw attention to yourself.
* Avoid using **public WIFI networks or internet terminals** because they do not protect your data or personal information. Consider using a VPN if you connect to public WIFI.
* There continue to be reports of street children begging, hassling, and behaving aggressively toward foreigners. The Embassy is aware of incidents where groups of street children approach and distract unsuspecting U.S. travelers.
* Organized crime remains an issue; high-profile arrests of Georgian nationals involved with transnational criminal groups continue to occur throughout Europe. Street gangs and drug dealers are common in Tbilisi and other urban areas of Georgia. These groups do not specifically target foreigners.
* Financial crimes in the form of credit card fraud against individuals and larger targeted attacks against banks and other financial institutions are common.
* Use caution at **ATMs** and always check for skimming devices or other tampering.

Safety Concerns for Women Travelers​:

* **Women travelers have been sexually harassed and assaulted in Georgia.** These incidents often take place afterhours in bars, clubs, or restaurants and alcohol and/or drugs is at times a factor. The Embassy recommends using a buddy system and exercising caution when travelers are alone and with a group of unknown people. In addition, women should use reputable taxi services and sit in the back seat and always carry a cellular phone to facilitate contacting police or a trusted individual in case of emergency.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may happen in response to political or economic issues, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas near demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Security alerts about demonstrations can be found on the Embassy’s website [here](https://ge.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes)pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobiles devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable and U.S. based. **Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.**

**GPS Navigation Apps** are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using **dating apps/online dating websites** abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the [U.S. Embassy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/) in Tbilisi at (+ 995) (32) 227-7724 (after hours + 995 32 227-7000).

The [Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA)](https://police.ge/en/home) runs a 24-hour emergency response center like 911 (dial 112). It transfers emergency calls to the fire and rescue service, police, or the nearest medical center. Most dispatchers speak Georgian and Russian, but they will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.

**Mobile 112 App:** Any person on the territory of Georgia can download and use the 112 mobile phone app. The main advantage of the app is the ability to determine the location of the user. The app is free of charge and is compatible with Android and iOS platforms. It is available in five languages, including English.

**Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.** The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement or legal authority overseas. It cannot investigate crimes in Georgia. Federal regulation prohibits U.S. embassy staff from acting as agents, attorneys, or in a fiduciary role for U.S. citizens in legal disputes overseas.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.  Local resources for victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or human trafficking include a hotline (dial 116-006), temporary shelters, medical and rehabilitation services, interpretation and legal assistance. These may be available through a government agency known as [Atipfund Georgia](http://atipfund.gov.ge/).

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are not routine. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

**Personal Safety in Remote Areas:**If you intend to **camp**, **climb**, or **hike** in the mountains or any remote area in Georgia:

* Research local conditions in advance. Landslides are common during periods of heavy rain and could create unanticipated obstacles.
* Go with a companion or a group. Avoid traveling alone.
* Provide route and contact information to someone not traveling with you.
* Maintain communication with your family and friends.
* If in trouble, call the emergency number 112. Most dispatchers speak Georgian and Russian, but, they will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.
