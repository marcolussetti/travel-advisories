# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** While in Cyprus, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States, though modern motorways link the major cities.

* **Traffic moves on the left side of the road** – the opposite direction most U.S. citizens are used to. **Pedestrians** should be extra careful and look both ways before crossing roads.
* Secondary roads, especially in mountainous areas, tend to be narrow and winding, and not as well maintained as major highways.
* Speeding, tailgating, overtaking, and the running of caution lights, though illegal, are common and are major causes of accidents.
* Road safety conditions in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots are similar to conditions in the south, except that the road network is less developed.
* **Insurance purchased in the government-controlled area is not valid in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots**, but insurance for that area may be purchased at the UN buffer zone checkpoints.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Traffic laws, signs, and speed limits are consistent with the standards used throughout Europe.
* **The use of seat belts (in front seats) and child car seats is mandatory**.
* **The use of cellular phones while driving is prohibited** unless used with some form of hands-free kit.
* **Motorcyclists** are required to wear **helmets**.
* You must have **liability insurance**.

**Public Transportation:** There are few public buses and no rail lines in Cyprus. Taxis are widely available.

See our [road safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information, as well as the website of Cyprus’ [national tourist office](https://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/).

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Cyprus, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Republic of Cyprus’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning to travel to Cyprus should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=ZH8vhpMLsRlhyYmGhsQmq712yBFWrSvYnnNWfPFbZHtddspH3KzQ!863626413!-1887722738?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).
