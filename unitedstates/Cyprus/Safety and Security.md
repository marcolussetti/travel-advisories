# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**U.N. Buffer Zone:**

* **Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to enter the United Nations buffer zone at any place other than a designated crossing point.**
* **Never photograph military installations** or anything that could be perceived as being of a security interest. Pay particular attention to areas marked with “no photography” signs. **Police on both sides of the island strictly enforce these restrictions**.

**Terrorism:** Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Terrorist groups, including their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack -- including edged weapons, pistols, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:** Cyprus generally has low crime rates.

* **Be alert and always aware of your surroundings and of your personal belongings.** Criminals often target those who are distracted, alone in an isolated area, or impaired.
* Do not leave any valuables unattended or out in public view.
* **Avoid so-called “night clubs” (topless bars),** as they reportedly employ women trafficked to Cyprus for sexual exploitation. Night clubs have presented foreign patrons with grossly-inflated bar tabs, threatening customers who refuse to pay.
* **Scams:** Financial crimes conducted over the internet have increased as scammers attempt to convince you to send them money. These fraudulent schemes can include:
  + Claims that make it appear you are helping a loved one or a friend who has been injured or is in trouble
  + Online dating/social networking services
  + Inheritance notices
  + Work permits/job offers
  + Bank overpayments

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
