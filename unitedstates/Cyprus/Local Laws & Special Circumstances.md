# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. **Possession of a U.S. passport will not prevent you from being detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned.**

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-extraterritorial-sexual-exploitation-children) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

**Travel in the Area Administered by Turkish Cypriots:**

* See Entry, Exit, and Visa Requirements above.
* The Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to you in this area is limited.
* Immigration officials at Larnaca Airport have occasionally turned around non-EU citizens who announce their intention to stay in hotels or villas determined by the Republic of Cyprus to be on land belonging to displaced Greek Cypriots. For more information on this issue and a full list of such properties, visit the webpage of the [Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in the United States.](http://www.cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=page&cid=1029)
* Car insurance purchased in the government-controlled area is not valid in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots. If you travel north of the UN buffer zone, you must have separate car insurance that can be purchased at the crossing points.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in the Republic of Cyprus or in the area administered by the Turkish Cypriots. Despite broad legal protections, LGB individuals sometimes face societal discrimination and few are open about their sexual orientation. Although public attitudes tend to be socially conservative in Cyprus, the U.S. Embassy has not received reports of violence against LGB travelers.

Seeour [LGB travel information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section six of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**

* The People with Disabilities Law mandates that public buildings and tourist facilities built after 1999 be accessible to all.
* Older buildings frequently lack access for persons with disabilities.
* Narrow or nonexistent sidewalks and lack of transport, parking spaces, accessible toilets, and elevators all pose problems for persons with disabilities.
* Republic of Cyprus law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services.
* For information on accessible travel in Cyprus, visit the [Accessible Cyprus](http://www.visitcyprus.com/index.php/en/practical-information/accessible) page of the Cyprus tourist office website.
