Visit the [Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus](https://www.cyprusembassy.net/visa.html) website for the most current visa information.

**Traveling Through Europe:** The republic of Cyprus is a member of the European Union but is not a party to the Schengen Agreement. However, if you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay** if you plan on transiting a Schengen country. Review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need s**ufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* You may enter the Republic of Cyprus for up to **90 days** **for tourism or business purposes** **without a visa**. For stays longer than 90 days, you will need a temporary residency visa.

Since 1974, the southern part of Cyprus has been under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part of Cyprus, administered by Turkish Cypriots, proclaimed itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) in 1983. The United States does not recognize the “TRNC,” nor does any country other than Turkey. A buffer zone patrolled by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus separates the two sides. For U.S. citizen travelers:

* **Enter and exit the Republic of Cyprus ONLY** at Larnaca and Paphos airports and at the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The Republic of Cyprus **does not consider** entry at Ercan Airport in the north to be a “legal” entrance into Cyprus.
* You **cannot receive a residency permit** from the Republic of Cyprus to reside in the area north of the UN buffer zone.
* You can cross the buffer zone and enter the Turkish Cypriot-administered area by showing a valid U.S. passport at one of the recognized checkpoints. You can stay in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area for less than 90 days. The Republic of Cyprus **does not recognize** residence permits issued by Turkish Cypriots. If you stay in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area for over 90 days, **you may be detained** by Republic of Cyprus immigration or police, or denied entry into the government-controlled part of the island.

**Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of the Republic of Cyprus.** There are no restrictions for short-term tourist stays and no HIV testing on entry. Authorities will not grant a residence permit for work or study to a U.S. citizen who tests positive for HIV.
