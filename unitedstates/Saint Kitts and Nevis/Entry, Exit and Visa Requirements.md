# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:** U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport to enter Saint Kitts and Nevis. No visa is required for stays up to 90 days if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself.

Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Saint Kitts and Nevis, as well as proof of anticipated departure from Saint Kitts and Nevis. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Saint Kitts and Nevis on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.

**All** passengers by air or sea must complete the eTA prior to travelling to the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis at [www.knatravelform.kn](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knatravelform.kn%2F&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7Cadf05f9fadf0456e285308ddcf69fae8%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638894776269303963%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=vO6EwcKsSoUEBOPwm05VIlEo9VzYtjstoqHDuANjjTw%3D&reserved=0) or via the eBorder – St. Kitts & Nevis app which is available on iOS and Android.  The cost of the eTA is US $8.50 (increases to US $17.00 from 1 September 2025) and all major credit and debit cards are acceptable.  Application for the eTA can be done 3 months prior to travel date with approval within 24 hours.

**HIV and AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV and AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Please contact the [Embassy of Saint Kitts and Nevis](https://www.embassydc.gov.kn/) before you travel for more information.
