**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills for overseas travelers.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas. We strongly recommend travelers obtain [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Medical facilities in Saint Kitts and Nevis do not meet U.S. standards, and medical transport can take hours to respond. St. Kitts has two hyperbaric chambers.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.
