# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Major roads are in average to poor condition, and drivers may encounter wandering animals and slow moving heavy equipment. Drivers often stop in the middle of the roadway without warning, so you should always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and watch for signs of sudden braking. Automobiles may lack working safety and signaling devices.

Please refer to our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:** Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. There is relatively little police enforcement of traffic regulations. Travelers are required to obtain a visitor's driver’s license, which may be obtained from the Traffic Department or the Fire Station for a small fee on presentation of a valid home or international license.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation consists of mini-buses and taxis. Established, reasonable fares are available from airport dispatchers and local hotels.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for regulating aviation safety and security for the government of Saint Kitts and Nevis, as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Saint Kitts and Nevis’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Saint Kitts and Nevis.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Saint Kitts and Nevis should exercise caution. Mariners planning travel to Saint Kitts and Nevis should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maritime.dot.gov%2Fmsci-advisories&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1e56c9bdae304311c6ee08dcd2762f87%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638616652251499337%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TVKlu%2FJ8rW7ddAXXwaf9LBnM7vqDT73uSorHSd8cP6c%3D&reserved=0 "https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories") and [alerts](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maritime.dot.gov%2Fmsci-alerts&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1e56c9bdae304311c6ee08dcd2762f87%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638616652251505206%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=vtHoV9J22Y6vs3ygh22En1uoWSZnkMQF0bqbcjd7He4%3D&reserved=0 "https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts").
