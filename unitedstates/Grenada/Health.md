Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the U.S. can cost thousands of dollars. Ambulance service is available, but response times vary greatly. Pharmacies are usually well stocked and prescription medicine is available. A hyperbaric chamber is available in Grenada.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.
