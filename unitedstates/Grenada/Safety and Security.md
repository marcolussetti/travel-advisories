# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted for crime in the Eastern Caribbean islands. However, crimes of opportunity such as petty larceny, burglary, automobile break-ins; as well as incidents of violent crime, such as murder, sexual assault, robbery, shootings, and drug related crimes do occasionally occur. As you would in any major metropolitan area of the United States, use the below personnel security measures while traveling:

* Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, on beaches, unsecured in hotel rooms, or in rental homes.
* Avoid walking alone, especially at night, on beaches, and in isolated or poorly lit locations.
* Go out in groups or with a companion and restrict nighttime activities to established safe and reputable venues.
* Use only clearly marked taxis and avoid rides with strangers.
* Stick to well-lit and well-traveled routes.
* Avoid displaying flashy jewelry, expensive electronics, and large amounts of cash.
* Be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you see something suspicious or unusual contact local police to report immediately.
* Use added caution when shopping in crowded areas, especially during the holiday season.
* Use added caution when attending crowded events, celebrations, music festivals, etc.
* Do not leave drinks unattended in public venues as this could create a potential vulnerability for the use of “date rape” drugs in furtherance of criminal activity.
* Do not be predictable; vary your daily routes and schedules.
* Do not engage in illegal activity.
* For boaters: Be wary of unfamiliar persons or crafts approaching your boat, whether at anchor or at sea.

Exercise appropriate caution after dark and when using buses or taxis. Take taxis to and from restaurants and ask whether the driver is a member of the Grenada Taxi Association (GTA). GTA members are required to pass additional driving tests and receive training from the Grenada Tourism Board. They are generally reliable and knowledgeable about the country and its attractions.

Victims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (473) 407-2495.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, hospitals are able to provide urgent medical treatment, though very serious injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
