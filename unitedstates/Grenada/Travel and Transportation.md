# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads are mostly narrow and winding, with many blind corners, narrow or no shoulders, and steep drops into the sea. There are few sidewalks. Road lighting varies, compounding dangers at night. Road signage is inadequate. Drive slowly and with caution.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. Seat belts are required, and violators may be fined EC$1,000 (US$400).

We recommend you get a local temporary driver’s license. In an accident, you may be fined if you do not have a local driver’s license, regardless of who is at fault. Vehicle rental companies may assist in applying for a temporary driver’s license.

**Public Transportation:**Small boat owners may offer to take you to, and between islands. Before accepting, check to be sure that the boat carries life preservers and a radio.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for regulating aviation safety and security for the government of Grenada, as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Grenada’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Grenada should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=ZH8vhpMLsRlhyYmGhsQmq712yBFWrSvYnnNWfPFbZHtddspH3KzQ!863626413!-1887722738?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).
