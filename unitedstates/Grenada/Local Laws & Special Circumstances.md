# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* If you use foul language in the presence of a police officer, you may be arrested and prosecuted.
* Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods. These are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Money:** It is difficult to cash personal U.S. checks in Grenada. If accepted, they will take approximately six weeks to clear by a local bank. Major credit cards are widely accepted, and ATM facilities are available at all banks. Most hotels and restaurants take U.S. currency; however, change will be in local currency.

**Customs:** See our [Customs](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) webpage for information on import restrictions.

**Climate:** Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes have been known to occur outside that period. During hurricane season, visitors are advised to monitor local weather reports closely in order to be prepared for any potential threats. Grenada is also located in a seismic zone, so earthquakes and tsunamis are possible. See our [website](https://bb.usembassy.gov/weather-alert-for-u-s-citizens-hurricane-season-2023/?_ga=2.201457876.412365303.1701781344-1550049776.1701781344) on disaster preparedness for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Grenadian law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men, with potential penalties of 10 years’ imprisonment. Prosecutions based on these laws are rare. Grenadian society is generally intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Individuals with mobility issues may find accessibility difficult. Although the law does not mandate access to public buildings or services, building owners increasingly incorporate accessibility access into new construction and renovated premises. Since public transportation is privately owned, the law does not mandate any special consideration for individuals with mobility issues.
