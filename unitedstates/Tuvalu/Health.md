For emergency services in Tuvalu, dial **911**.

* Medical and dental care is very limited in Tuvalu. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Serious medical problems are referred to health professionals and hospitals in Guam or Hawaii.
* Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost thousands of dollars. Doctors and hospitals often expect payment “up front” prior to service or admission.

Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.
