[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

* Medical and dental care is very limited in Tuvalu. Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Serious medical problems are referred to health professionals and hospitals in Guam or Hawaii.
* Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost thousands of dollars. Doctors and hospitals often expect payment “up front” prior to service or admission.

For emergency services in Tuvalu, dial **911**.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
