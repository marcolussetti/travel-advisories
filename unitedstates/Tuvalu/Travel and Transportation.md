# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Traffic moves on the left in Tuvalu. The main roads on Funafuti are paved, but other roads on other islands are generally unpaved. Animals and pedestrians walking in the road make night driving on unlit secondary roads hazardous. For specific information concerning Tuvalu driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the [Tuvalu Permanent Mission to the United Nations](https://www.un.int/tuvalu/).

**Traffic Laws:**Driving while intoxicated is illegal and punishable by fine or imprisonment. Exercise caution, as traffic tends to move slowly.

**Public Transportation:**The main forms of public transportation are taxis or motorcycles.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Tuvalu’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:**  Mariners and passengers planning travel to Tuvalu should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Tuvalu. Until those concerns can be addressed, the U.S. Coast Guard advises that mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Tuvalu should exercise caution.
