# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Traffic moves on the left in Tuvalu. The main roads on Funafuti are paved, but other roads on other islands are generally unpaved. Animals and pedestrians walking in the road make night driving on unlit secondary roads hazardous. For specific information concerning Tuvalu driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the [Tuvalu Permanent Mission to the United Nations.](https://www.un.int/tuvalu/)

**Traffic Laws:**Driving while intoxicated is illegal and punishable by fine or imprisonment. Exercise caution, as traffic tends to move slowly.

**Public Transportation:**The main forms of public transportation are taxis or motorcycles.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Tuvalu, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Tuvalu’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)
