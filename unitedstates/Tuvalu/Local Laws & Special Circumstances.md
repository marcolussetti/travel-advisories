# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/)website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/)for further information.

**Currency:** The Australian dollar is the legal currency in Tuvalu. The Tuvalu National Bank accepts traveler’s checks and most major currencies, including U.S. dollars.

You should be prepared to pay cash for hotel bills and all other services, since credit card services are not available. There are no ATMs on Tuvalu, so it may not be possible to withdraw cash from overseas bank accounts.

**Cyclone Season:**The official cyclone season is November through April. The [Fiji Meteorological Service](https://www.met.gov.fj/index.php?page=public)maintains a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Nadi serving the Southwest Pacific Region. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available at the [State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-can-you-do-crisis-abroad/natural-disasters.html), as well as from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/)website.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**

Tuvalu prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disability. Supplementary state services to address the special needs of persons with disabilities are very limited.

There are no mandated building accessibility provisions for persons with disabilities. The only multi-story government building has elevators, but they are not always operational. There are no elevators in private multi-story buildings.
