# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Tuvalu has a low crime rate. However, visitors should review their own personal security practices, be alert to any unusual activity around their homes or businesses and report any suspicious incidents to local police authorities.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:**Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +679 331 4466, or after hours at +679 772 8049. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near Funafuti. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
