# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**The U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of Juba, even in emergencies, is extremely limited.**

Land mines remain a hazard, especially outside of Juba.

Armed conflict between various political and ethnic groups continues throughout the country.

* Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba.
* Be vigilant when traveling outside of cities and avoid travel along border areas.
* Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.
* Monitor local/international news and [consular messages](https://ss.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.

**Crime: The population has ready access to weapons due to years of civil war, inter- and intra-ethnic conflict, and political unrest.**

**In Juba**,the most frequently reported violent crimes include armed robbery, carjacking, and home invasion. Criminals target people who are walking, driving, traveling alone or in small groups, especially at night. Most criminal incidents affecting Westerners appear to target victims based on perceived wealth and vulnerability rather than nationality. Criminals frequently wear security service uniforms, carry military weapons, and use the ruse of security check points or official business to stop individuals or gain access to compounds.

**Outside Juba**, road ambushes and roadside crime are common and often involve violence. Violent crimes (murder, armed robbery, home invasions, cattle raiding, kidnapping) and non-violent petty theft and fraud are pervasive.

Throughout the country, crimes of opportunity include:

* Muggings
* Pickpocketing
* Theft from vehicles
* Fraudulent currency exchanges

Thefts usually occur near restaurants, banks, or other areas in proximity of foreigners.

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.
* Do not display cash or valuables.
* Dress conservatively.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location.
