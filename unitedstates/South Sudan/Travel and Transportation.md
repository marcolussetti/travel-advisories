# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**There are very few paved roads; most are narrow, rutted, and poorly maintained. Roads are often impassable during the rainy season (March to November). Pedestrians and animals in the roadways, excessive speed, erratic driving, lack of street lights, and overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles pose additional risks.

When driving in remote areas, travel during daylight hours only and use convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the threat of roadside criminals. Carry spare tires, parts, fuel, and provisions. Service stations are separated by long distances. Professional roadside assistance service is not available.

**Checkpoints:** Approach all vehicle checkpoints with caution, especially after dark or during times of heightened political or military tensions, and do not attempt to evade them. Even stops at checkpoints operated by the government of South Sudan may become hostile or violent.

Keep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Anyone staffing checkpoints will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.

**Landmines:** Years of conflict have left the threat of unexploded ordnance, including landmines, as a hazard on or near major roads. Stay on main roads marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

**Traffic Laws:** An international driver's license and third-party liability insurance from the government is required. Those convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol face fines, jail sentences, and corporal punishment.

**Accidents:** If involved in an accident resulting in death or injury, report the incident to the nearest police station or police officer as soon as possible. Remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly. Many local drivers are uninsured.

**Public Transportation:** You should hire private transportation from a reputable source. The use of public transportation (small buses, vans, or motorbike taxis “boda-bodas”) is off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel and should be avoided whenever possible. Drivers of these vehicles frequently have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Schedules are unpublished and subject to change without notice. There is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in South Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of South Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
