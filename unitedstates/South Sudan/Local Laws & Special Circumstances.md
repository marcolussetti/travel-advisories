# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

South Sudan’s security services commit arbitrary arrests and often detain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens. Extortion is common.

Security forces often operate outside civilian control and do not always follow laws governing due process and treatment of detainees.

U.S. citizens may have little recourse to justice should they be detained. Legal proceedings can be lengthy and subjective.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

South Sudanese law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals and dual nationals in detention.

If you have reason to believe a U.S. citizen may be detained or incarcerated in South Sudan, do not assume the Embassy is already aware. Contact the Embassy and provide as much information as possible.

**Journalism:** Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan and have been killed while covering the conflict. They have also reported being detained with no due process or deported from the country with no warning.

**Controlled Items:** Certain items which are normal and legal to possess elsewhere are tightly controlled in South Sudan. Bringing them into the country without government permission, or even traveling internally with them, can result in extra scrutiny by security officials, the confiscation of your items, and your arrest.

Metal detectors, which can be used for prospecting, are tightly controlled, especially if you are traveling to an area where mining takes place. Some forms of communication equipment such as satellite phones (commonly referred to by their trade names: Thurayas or Iridiums) are required to be registered with the government. Imports of any form of military material or “dual-use” items including their components are highly scrutinized, even if commercially available; this includes commercial drones.

U.S. citizens should contact the [Embassy of the Republic of South Sudan](http://www.southsudanembassyusa.org/) for questions regarding what equipment they may or may not import into the country and how to obtain authorizations for specific equipment or to bring in large sums of cash.

**Dual Nationals:** The Embassy recommends all dual nationals obtain visas for their U.S. passport covering the duration of their stay in South Sudan. If staying longer than a typical visa will allow, dual nationals are strongly encouraged to obtain a five-year residency permit. These documents are available for a fee at any local Government of South Sudan Immigration office.

**Aid Workers:** Consult with the security personnel representing your organization. Compounds housing aid workers have been breached and aid workers, including U.S. citizens, have been the targets of shootings, ambushes, violent assaults, harassment, and robberies.

**Currency:** The South Sudanese pound (SSP) is the official currency. It is a cash exclusive society. Carry sufficient funds in to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. ATMs draw on local banks only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. U.S. currency that is damaged or issued prior to 2006 is not accepted.

**Photography:** For any photography, amateur and professional, a permit is required and may be obtained from the Ministry of Interior for $50. Even with a permit, you must be careful taking pictures, as police have arrested and physically assaulted tourists for using a camera. In addition, traveling with professional photography equipment will trigger extra scrutiny regardless of occupation.

* Never take pictures of government buildings, vehicles, or persons in uniform.
* Do not take pictures of infrastructure such as bridges or airports.
* Keep your camera concealed and do not take random photos in public.
* Do not take photos of South Sudanese without their permission and be courteous of those who shy away from having their pictures taken.

**LGB Travelers:**Same-sex sexual relations are considered illegal in South Sudan with penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, if consensual. If non-consensual, the penalty is up to 14 years’ imprisonment. Societal discrimination against LGB persons is widespread, and there are no known LGB organizations.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Women suffer from high levels of sexual violence, including abduction, rape, and forced marriage. The law does not prohibit domestic violence. Spousal abuse is common and police seldom intervene.
