Medical facilities, medicine severely limited.

For emergency services in DRC, dial **112** for the police and call a local private hospital for medical assistance. A list of [medical providers](https://cd.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/) is available on the U.S. Embassy website.

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country except by private medical providers in major cities.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. All care providers expect payment in U.S. dollars before treatment.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance covers you overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental medical insurance with medical evacuation coverage.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html)

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of [DRC](http://www.dgm.cd/) to ensure the medication is legal in DRC.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in DRC. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season from May to October. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in DRC.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health facilities in general:**

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://cd.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Hospitals and medical professionals may require cash payment.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight and food services and supplies are the responsibility of the patient. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Travelers should carry medical prescriptions for medicine they take to the DRC.
* DRC does not allow the importation of Dipyrone (Metamizole, Noramidopyrine) and Apha Beta-Arteether. Travelers should avoid carrying these medications.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to the DRC to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* There is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in DRC. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same-sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by DRC courts.
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in DRC via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship.

**Water Quality:**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel:**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).

[Chemoprophylaxis](http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html) is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

**HIV/AIDS:** In 2018, HIV was noted as the 10th leading cause of death in the DRC. The disease is still prevalent and standard precautions should be taken, including safe sex practices.

There are shortages of medicine and medical supplies throughout the rural areas of DRC and some areas suffer clean water shortages.
