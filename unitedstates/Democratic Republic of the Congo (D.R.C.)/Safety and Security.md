# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

See the Department of State [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html) and Alerts for the DRC.

The security situation in most parts of eastern DRC remains unstable due to the activities of rebel and other armed groups and ongoing military operations. Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash with each other. Civilians are frequently targeted in attacks and other illegal activities, such as kidnapping, forced taxation, and forced labor.

Terrorist and armed groups operating in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have regularly attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in the area. Armed group violence has increased in parts of South Kivu.

Sporadic but severe outbreaks of violence targeting civilians, including killing, rape, kidnapping, and pillaging, continue throughout North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut Lomami, Bas-Uele, and Haut-Uele and three Kasai provinces of Kasai Oriental, Kasai Central, and Kasai Provinces.

Travelers in remote area of the country, especially in the eastern DRC, should travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones. Road travelers are frequently targeted for ambush, armed robbery, and kidnapping.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity (mainly for financial gain) are the most reported incidents of crime against U.S. citizens in Kinshasa and throughout the DRC. Most incidents involve theft such as pickpocketing, burglary, and robbery. Petty crime may be more likely in public places and areas of congregation. Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability.

**Roadblocks:** Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check identity papers. They may also solicit bribes. Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Remain calm and, if threatened, do not resist.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations and gatherings occur with increasing frequency and with little notice. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. Police have at times responded to demonstrations with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests. In the eastern DRC, demonstrations can rapidly become extrajudicial mobs and turn violent, posing a threat to humanitarian aid workers and other personnel operating in the area.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check U.S. Embassy messaging and local media for updates and advisories.
  + Monitor [consular Alerts and messages](https://cd.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) and local and international news from reliable sources.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Kidnapping for Ransom:** The risk of kidnapping for ransom exists throughout the country, but is more common in eastern DRC. International humanitarian workers have been targeted. Reports of kidnapping of a U.S. citizen should be passed to the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +243 81-555-5944 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +243 97 261- 6145. Dial 112 to contact the police in an emergency in Kinshasa.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are limited and are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance, especially given the current COVID-19 pandemic.
