# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport: Must be valid for six months after entry into country
* Visa: Obtain your visa before traveling.
* Immunizations: World Health Organization (WHO) card with yellow fever vaccination.

Visit the [Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo](http://www.ambardcusa.org/) website for the most current visa information. Overseas inquiries may be made at the nearest Congolese Embassy or Consulate. However; U.S. citizens are generally required to apply for visas from the DRC Embassy in Washington, D.C. Allow at least two to three weeks for visa processing.

The DRC does not recognize dual nationality. U.S. citizens should always present themselves as U.S. citizens to Congolese authorities. Otherwise, it may impede our ability to provide consular services.

**Airport Fees:** All departing international travelers must pay these official fees when checking in:

* $50 airport exit fee
* $5 boarding fee
* Passengers on domestic flights pay $10.

If you experience harassment at any port of entry, such as detention, passport confiscation or demands by immigration and security personnel for unofficial “fees,” ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately.

**Intending Residents:** If you plan to reside in the DRC, register at the office of the [Direction General of Migration (DGM)](https://www.dgm.cd/visas.html) in your commune of residence.

**Journalists:** Journalists working in the DRC must:

* enter the DRC through Kinshasa
* obtain a permit from the Ministry of Communication and Media (a $250 permit is valid for one month)

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the DRC.
