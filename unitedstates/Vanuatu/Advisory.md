***Updated to a Level 3 due to infrastructure damage from an earthquake.***

The U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to Vanuatu following the December 17, 2024, earthquake, which caused significant damage to local infrastructure. The U.S. government’s ability to provide emergency assistance to U.S. citizens in Vanuatu is limited, and departure options have been disrupted. Within Vanuatu, numerous buildings sustained severe damage, and curfews are in effect in some areas.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vanuatu.html) for additional information on travel to Vanuatu.
