# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Public Safety:** Civil disorder in Vanuatu is relatively rare; however, you should avoid public demonstrations and/or political rallies if they occur.

**Crime:** Although violent crime is relatively rare in Vanuatu, there is always a risk that you could be a victim of theft, burglary, sexual harassment, or sexual assault. Take reasonable precautions to avoid undue risk, especially in tourist areas. Women should avoid going out alone at night or to isolated locations. The Embassy has also received some reports of ATM or credit card number theft after a card was used in Vanuatu. While this does not appear to be widespread, travelers are advised to monitor their accounts after using their ATM or credit cards in Vanuatu for any unauthorized activity.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should contact the U.S. Embassy in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea for assistance at (+675) 308 2100.

Report crimes to the local police at 1111 or non-emergency (+678) 2222 in Port Vila and (+678) 36222 in Santo, and contact the U.S. Embassy in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea at (+675) 308 2100. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
