**Criminal Penalties**

You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Local customary law is observed in Vanuatu especially in rural areas. Disputes based in customary law are generally resolved through a compensation-based settlement mediated by law enforcement or law government officials.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**

If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs**

Vanuatu customs authorities may enforce strict regulations on importing or exporting items such as firearms, certain prescription drugs, wooden artifacts, exotic animals, food items, and sexually explicit material. Other products may be subject to quarantine. For specific information regarding customs requirements, contact the [Permanent Mission of the Republic of Vanuatu](https://www.un.int/vanuatu/content/permanent-mission-republic-vanuatu-united-nations-0) to the United Nations, 800 Second Avenue, Suite 400B, New York, NY 10017, Telephone: (212) 661-4303; fax: (212) 422-3427, (212) 661-5544.

**Natural Disasters**

Vanuatu is among the most natural disaster prone countries in the world. Visitors should be aware that natural disasters can occur at any time with little or not notice. For general information on disaster preparedness visit the Department of State [Crisis and Disaster Preparedness](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) webpage.

**Cyclones**

Cyclones can occur suddenly in Vanuatu. Cyclone season usually lasts from November to April. Damaging winds, rough seas, intense rain and flash flooding, landslides, and disruptions to services may occur. Local media and hotels will convey cyclone alerts issued by local authorities.

**Volcanoes/Earthquakes**

Vanuatu is frequently subject to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. If you plan to visit volcanic areas, contact the Department of Geology and Mines at (677) 22423 or the [Vanuatu Tourism Office](mailto:tourism@vanuatu.com.vu) at prior to traveling to areas where volcanic activity may occur.

Detailed information about earthquakes is available from the [National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/). If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of local authorities. Visit the [Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards page](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php) to obtain current climate advisories, including volcano activity levels. All of Ambae Island and parts of Ambrym Island have been evacuated permanently due to regular volcanic activity. Avoid these areas and others under evacuation orders.

The law in Vanuatu does not prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.

The availability of rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants is extremely limited.
