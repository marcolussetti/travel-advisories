# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens need a valid passport, onward ticket, and proof of sufficient funds in order to enter Vanuatu. Tourist visas are not required for stays of up to 30 days. If you plan to stay longer than 30 days, you may apply for a standard residence permit or for an extension of stay for up to 120 days at the Immigration Office. You should do so before your initial 30-day period expires. Please contact the Principal Immigration Officer, Immigration Department, at (+678) 22354.
