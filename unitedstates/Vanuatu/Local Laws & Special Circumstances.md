# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Customs:**Vanuatu customs authorities may enforce strict regulations on importing or exporting items such as firearms, certain prescription drugs, wooden artifacts, exotic animals, food items, and sexually explicit material. Other products may be subject to quarantine. For specific information regarding customs requirements, contact the [Permanent Mission of the Republic of Vanuatu](https://www.un.int/vanuatu/content/permanent-mission-republic-vanuatu-united-nations-0) to the United Nations, 800 Second Avenue, Suite 400B, New York, NY 10017, Telephone: (212) 661-4303; fax: (212) 422-3427, (212) 661-5544.

**Natural Disasters:**The United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) has consistently ranked Vanuatu number one on the World Risk Index for its many different types of natural disasters and its difficulties in recovering from them.  Visitors need to be aware of disasters which can occur at any time.

**Cyclones:** Cyclones can occur suddenly in Vanuatu. Cyclone season usually lasts from November to April, and severe flooding, landslides, and disruptions to services may occur. Local media and hotels will convey cyclone alerts issued by local authorities.

**Volcanoes/Earthquakes:** Vanuatu is subject to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. If you plan to visit volcanic areas, contact the Department of Geology and Mines at (677) 22423 or the [Vanuatu Tourism Office](mailto:tourism@vanuatu.com.vu) at tourism@vanuatu.com.vu prior to traveling to areas where volcanic activity may occur. Detailed information about earthquakes is available from the [National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/). If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of local authorities. Visit the [Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards page](https://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php) to obtain current climate advisories, including volcano activity levels All of Ambae Island and parts of Ambrym Island have been evacuated due to high and on-going volcanic activity. Avoid areas being evacuated.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers**: Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Vanuatu. However, there are no known incidents of the prosecution, targeting, or harassment of consenting adults. Vanuatu is a conservative country, and we recommend that you avoid public displays of affection. See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and the [Vanuatu Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2018&dlid=289093#wrapper) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: There is no law specifically prohibiting discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. There are no special programs to assist persons with disabilities and no legislation mandating access to buildings, information, and communications. In practice, most buildings in Vanuatu are not accessible to persons with disabilities, and disabled persons often rely on assistance from friends and family.

**Recreational Diving:** Diving in Vanuatu has the potential to be dangerous. We suggest the following tips for visitors who plan to dive while in Vanuatu:

* Verify that your dive operator is currently certified through one of the international diving associations (PADI, NAUI, BSAC, CMAS, etc.).
* Ensure that rental equipment is in good working condition, with up-to-date inspection stamps.
* Make sure your equipment fits properly.
* Postpone or cancel diving activity if any equipment is faulty.
* Try to remain in pairs or in a group that includes a dive guide.
* Determine your level of training before engaging in deep water or wreck dives.
* Confirm that dive operators have adequate onsite emergency equipment and diver-recall systems.
* Know that the nearest hyperbaric chamber might be hours away, or require a plane flight. There is one hyperbaric facility in Port Vila, Vanuatu, far from some of the more remote dive sites. Due to the high costs for decompression services and associated emergency transportation, divers are strongly advised to obtain adequate medical evacuation and diver’s insurance.
* Please report any unsafe conditions or diving practices to either the certifying diving association or the local authorities.
