# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Travel by road can be hazardous. Always use your seatbelt. Roads are generally narrow and in poor repair. Only the capital city of Port Vila and the town of Luganville have consistently paved roads, which have a maximum speed limit of 30 miles per hour (50 kilometers per hour). On all roads, give way to traffic coming from the right, and to traffic coming from the left at roundabouts. To avoid trespassing, seek permission from local landowners before accessing non-public areas, including beaches. Some landowners may charge a fee for access.

**Traffic Laws:**If you are involved in a road accident, local law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. If a crowd gathers after an accident and you feel threatened, proceed directly to a police station. Incidents of individuals being harmed by crowds as a result of a traffic accident are rare.

Many local drivers are not well trained and do not follow basic traffic laws. Be aware of drivers under the influence of alcohol, pedestrians who are not aware of traffic, and children running into the road. Drivers have very limited visibility due to a lack of roadway illumination. Police control of traffic is limited, even in Port Vila. When driving, be alert at all times. Street signs and traffic lights are scarce or may not be in working order.

**Public Transportation:**Taxi services are widely available in Port Vila and Luganville and are generally safe. Public bus and mini-bus services are also available, but safety standards may vary widely and information on routes may not be available in a published form. Incidences of petty theft are generally rare by are more frequent on public transportation.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Vanuatu, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Vanuatu’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
