# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

A valid passport, along with an onward/return ticket and sufficient funds, is required for entry. A **no-cost visitor visa** valid for 30 days is issued upon arrival. A Traveler Declaration must be filled in and submitted by all travelers travelling to and from the Maldives, within 96 hours prior to their travel. You may submit the form electronically. Travelers should only submit their information via the government [IMUGA site](https://imuga.immigration.gov.mv/traveller). Be aware that non-government sites purport to provide visa services for a fee – these sites are scams and should not be trusted.

The [Department of Immigration and Emigration](https://www.immigration.gov.mv/) routinely approves requests for extension of stays up to 90 days for travelers who present evidence of sufficient funds and who stay in a resort/hotel or present a letter from a local sponsor. Anyone staying more than 60 days without proper authorization faces heavy fines of 15,000 MVR and/or deportation.

A yellow fever vaccine is required for individuals above nine months of age who are traveling to the Maldives from a country designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to have a risk of yellow fever transmission, including transit wait time of more than 12 hours in an airport located in such a country. For more information, please refer to [WHO](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/yellow-fever).

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the Maldives.
