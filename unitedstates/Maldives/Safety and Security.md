# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Markets

Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Maldives has a low crime rate and crime on resort islands is rare. Valuables may be stolen when left unattended on beaches or in hotels. The penalty for drug use or possession is severe.

**Demonstrations** may take place in response to political or economic issues, but primarily take place in Malé or other larger cities and are unlikely to be noticed by tourists.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobiles devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombo for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombo at +94-11-202-8500. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur at all tourist facilities. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
