# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Markets
* Public transportation systems (including, buses, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** The Maldives has a low crime rate and crime on resort islands is rare. Valuables may be stolen when left unattended on beaches or in hotels. The penalty for drug use or possession is severe.

**Demonstrations:**  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, but primarily take place in Malé or other larger cities and are unlikely to be noticed by tourists.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a populated public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Technology Usage Abroad:**  SIM cards and virtual SIM cards can be purchased at the airport upon arrival.  Otherwise, international cellular/data roaming in the Maldives is generally very expensive.

Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:**  Report crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy in Colombo at +94-11-202-8500. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare.  Accidents involving water sports in the Maldives happen every year. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
