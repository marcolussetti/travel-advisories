# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the country, arrested, or put in prison. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

When transiting the Maldives, travelers should ensure their luggage does not contain prohibited or restricted items, which include weapons, ammunition, alcohol, pornography, vaping devices and religious material offensive to Islam, among other items. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings.

Alcoholic drinks are only available on resort islands. Do not take any alcohol out of your resort.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Electronic Cigarettes (Vaping Devices):** The Maldives announced a ban on the use, import, and sale of vaping devices, effective from November 15, 2024. It is illegal for travelers to bring electronic cigarettes (vaping devices) and all vaping solutions to the Maldives. Customs will confiscate vaping devices and solutions and travelers may be fined or arrested. Do not bring or use vaping devices to the Maldives.

**Religious Laws:** Public observance of any religion other than Islam is prohibited. Religious gatherings such as Bible study groups are prohibited; however, individuals may practice their religion, including Bible readings, within their residences. It is against the law to invite or encourage Maldivian citizens to attend these gatherings. Offenders may face jail sentences, expulsion, and/or fines. Although Maldivian law prohibits importing “idols for religious worship,” tourists traveling to the resort islands are generally allowed to bring in items and texts used for personal religious observances.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** The law prohibits same-sex sexual conduct. Under the penal code, the punishment for conviction includes up to eight years’ imprisonment and 100 lashes. None of the legal provisions prohibiting discrimination covers discrimination based on sexual orientation and the law does not recognize LGB individuals, couples, and their families.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in the Maldives prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Maldivian law requires public places such as supermarkets and parks to have facilities that will enable access for people with disabilities. Despite the law, most public places do not yet have access for the disabled, and implementation of the law may take some time. Expect accessibility to be limited in general

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure) for U.S. Students.

**Women Travelers:** Women should consider wearing conservative clothing when sightseeing or island-hopping around Malé and other inhabited islands, keeping in mind boats are the main mode of transportation between nearby islands. There are no beaches in Malé or Hulhumalé that allow bikinis, this is usually only allowed at resort islands. Pay attention to beach signage and marking, at a minimum observe what the local and expatriate visitors are wearing to have an idea of local customs.

 If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you should call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the U.S. Embassy in Colombo (+94-11-202-8500). We can sometimes connect you with a non-governmental organization in the Maldives that may be able to provide assistance.
