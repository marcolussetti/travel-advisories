For emergency services in the Maldives, dial 102.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Malé/Hulhumalé. Available ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Some inter-island sea ambulance service is available via the Maldivian National Defense Force, Maldives Coast Guard, or Maldivian Airlines air ambulance, but does not serve the entire country.

See our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Maldives Ministry of Health](https://health.gov.mv/en) to ensure the medication is legal in the Maldives.

**Vaccinations:**Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Maldives.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recommended vaccines that are specific to this region include Japanese encephalitis and typhoid (and rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis only if exposure to bats is anticipated).

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassy and Consulates.

**Health facilities in general:**There are three large hospitals in the Malé area: ADK Hospital, Tree Top Hospital, and the government-run IGMH. Medical facilities outside Malé are limited. Hospitals and doctors typically require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. The availability of medical supplies is uneven, and shortage of basic over-the-counter medicines occurs frequently.  Many common medications used in the United States are not available in the Maldives; therefore, travelers should always carry any prescription medications with them.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://lk.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in larger cities. Hospital-based care is only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls.  Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:** Tap water is not potable. You should use ONLY boiled or bottled water for drinking, making ice, and for beverages.
