For Ambulance services in the Maldives, dial 102.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Malé/Hulhumalé. Available ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Some inter-island sea ambulance service is available via the Maldivian Navy but does not serve the entire country.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Maldives.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medical Facilities:** There are three large hospitals in the Malé area: ADK Hospital, Tree Top Hospital, and the government-run IGMH. Medical facilities outside Malé are limited. Hospitals and doctors typically require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. The availability of medical supplies is uneven and many common medications used in the United States are not available in Maldives; therefore, travelers should always carry any prescription medications with them.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://lk.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/Doctors-List-February-2020.pdf). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/maldives) recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recommended vaccines that are specific to this region include Japanese encephalitis and typhoid (and rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis only if exposure to bats is anticipated).

**Pharmaceuticals**: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. Please visit [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/counterfeit-medicine) website for more information.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Maldives Ministry of Health](https://health.gov.mv/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Maldives.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassy and Consulates.

**Water Quality**: You should use ONLY boiled or bottled water for drinking, making ice, and for beverages.
