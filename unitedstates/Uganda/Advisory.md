***Updated to reflect information on public demonstrations.***

Reconsider travel to Uganda due to **crime, terrorism**, and **anti-LGB laws and environment**. Exercise increased caution due to potential risks and the unpredictable nature of **public demonstrations**. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

There remains a threat of **terrorist attacks** in Uganda. Terrorist attacks have occurred, targeting religious venues, schools, and areas frequented by tourists. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of Ugandans as well as foreign visitors. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. ISIS-Central Africa have carried out attacks and claimed responsibility for killing two international tourists and a Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park.

**Violent crime** -- including armed robbery, home invasion, and sexual assault -- poses a serious threat to visitors and residents in Uganda. These acts can occur at any time, especially in larger cities, including Kampala, Jinja, and Entebbe, as well as the Karamoja region and along Uganda’s western and northern borders. Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.

The May 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) raises the **risk that LGB persons, those perceived to be LGB, or those found to be “promoting” LGB could face fines, imprisonment, or the death penalty**. They may also face harassment, violence, or attacks by vigilantes or mobs. Under the law, individuals or organizations that “promote” LGB human rights could face prosecution. Instances of assault and harassment based on unsubstantiated accusations of supporting the LGB community have occurred throughout the country. The AHA applies to both visitors and residents of Uganda.

**Public demonstrations** and protests can occur with little to no warning and may increase in frequency around political issues and events such as elections. When protests, strikes, and demonstrations turn unruly, security services are quick to use batons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and gunshots to disperse crowds.
