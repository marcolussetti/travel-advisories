***Updated with information on upcoming national elections and the “If you decide to travel” section.***

Reconsider travel to Uganda due to **crime, terrorism**, and **laws targeting persons on the basis of sexual orientation**.  Exercise increased caution due to potential security risks and the unpredictable nature of **public demonstrations**.  This includes demonstrations by political groups leading up to the January to February 2026 elections.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Country Summary:** There remains a threat of **terrorist attacks** in Uganda.  Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

Terrorist attacks have targeted:

* Religious venues
* Schools
* Government buildings
* Police stations
* Transportation hubs
* Areas visited by tourists.

These attacks have resulted in the deaths of Ugandans as well as foreign visitors.  U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. In 2023, ISIS-Central Africa attacked and claimed responsibility for killing two international tourists and a Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park.

**Violent crime** is a real danger in Uganda**.** Itincludes armed robbery, home invasion, and sexual assault.  Both visitors and residents face these threats. Crime can happen anytime.  It is more common in larger cities, including:

* Kampala
* Jinja
* Entebbe
* Karamoja region
* Along Uganda’s western and northern borders

Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.

**Laws Targeting Persons on the Basis of Sexual Orientation**The 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) applies to both visitors and residents of Uganda.  The AHA increases the danger for persons who may be targeted on the basis of their sexual orientation, those seen as or perceived to be lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and those accused of “promoting homosexuality.”  They could face fines, imprisonment, or the death penalty and may also face harassment, violence, or attacks by vigilantes or mobs.  Assault and harassment cases linked to support for lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons have happened across the country.

**Public Demonstrations**Protests can occur with little to no warning.  They often rise around political issues and events, like elections.  Primary elections will happen in summer 2025.  National elections are set for January to February 2026.  When protests, strikes, and demonstrations turn chaotic, security services respond with force.  They have used batons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and gunfire to break up the crowds.
