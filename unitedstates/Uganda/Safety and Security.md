# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

In April 2019, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped in Queen Elizabeth National Park, in the southwest region of Uganda, near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The U.S. citizen was later released unharmed.

There is increased terrorist activity within the region. Recent events include the Ugandan Police Force reportedly foiling a planned bomb attack on churches by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Kampala; reported foiled plots of church attacks and subsequent explosive devices found in Kampala, and a fatal terror attack by ISIS-CA killing two international tourists and Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park. Anyone can be a victim at any time; U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. Communications plans are basic ways for people to ensure they can be reached while on travel or anywhere really. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc. The State Department discusses this in the link here: <https://exchanges.state.gov/us/keeping-touch>.

**Northern and Eastern Uganda**: The South Sudan-Uganda border is porous, and there are frequent reports of criminal trade and movement of people across the border. Due to the influx of refugees from South Sudan into Uganda, there is a strain on the region’s health, education, and security resources. Sporadic clashes may occur along the shared border, which may be poorly demarcated; a section is under dispute in the Moyo area of northwestern Uganda, abutting the Kajo Keji area of South Sudan.

Crime and conflict threat in the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda remain volatile. The Uganda People’s Defense Force actively engages criminals in the Karamoja Region, and armed confrontation between police and criminal elements can occur. Emergency medical care and auto repair services are lacking in remote areas of the Karamoja Region. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the Karamoja region.

**Southwestern Uganda/Western Uganda**: U.S. citizens traveling in southwestern Uganda along Uganda’s western border with the DRC should be aware that armed groups, including those aligned with terrorist organizations such as ISIS-CA, are active in eastern DRC, along with ongoing military operations to counter the threat in the region. Travelers should review the [country information page and Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html) for the DRC. Refugee flows across the border can number in the thousands, and there is a risk of incursions by armed combatants and criminals.

There is a potential for violence related to ethnic and tribal tensions in the western districts of Bundibuguyo, Ntoroko, and Kasese, near the border with the DRC. U.S. citizens should be vigilant and monitor local media for the latest news.

There is an uptick in terrorist activity in this specific region. Attacks in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kasese,and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha have resulted in deaths of Ugandan as well as foreign nationals.

The Governments of Rwanda and Uganda closed the Rwanda-Uganda border for extended periods of time in the last year. Some shutdowns are 24-hour closures and others are only overnight closures. Travelers should ensure the border is open when attempting to travel between Rwanda and Uganda.

The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the region from Lake Albert down to the Rwandan border.

The U.S. State Department encourages overseas travelers to develop communication plans to ensure they can be reached while traveling. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc.

**Demonstrations**: Demonstrations in Kampala and other cities periodically occur in response to local political developments Police routinely use tear gas – and sometimes live ammunition resulting in deaths – to disperse protests in urban areas. U.S. citizens are urged to monitor media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times. Avoid demonstrations, as even peaceful gatherings can turn violent without notice.

**Involvement in Local Social Issues**: All U.S. citizen travelers to Uganda should ensure that they have the correct visa for their visit to Uganda. Missionary and NGO work frequently require a work visa. Travelers who plan to engage in religious or civil society activities should obtain the appropriate visa from the Embassy of Uganda before departing the United States. The Government of Uganda has shown an increased interest in the activities of foreigners working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local authorities have been known to detain, question, and arrest foreigners in Uganda, and some visitors have been ordered removed from the country.

**Crime**: Pick pocketing, purse snatching, and thefts from hotel rooms, parked vehicles, and vehicles stalled in traffic jams are common. Armed robberies of pedestrians and car jackings also occur, sometimes during daylight hours and in public places. Victims usually remain unharmed if they do not resist. Assaults and property snatching by boda boda (motorcycle operators and passengers) are routinely reported.  
  
Food and drinks should never be left unattended in public. Women have reported being drugged and taken to another location and sexually assaulted. Similar tactics are used to rob individuals on public transportation. Remain with a group of friends in public, as single individuals are more likely to be targeted.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Uganda. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase

**Victims of Crime**: Victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance and counseling immediately regarding prophylactic treatment to help prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. A [list of local medical providers](https://ug.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) can be found on the U.S. Embassy website.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
