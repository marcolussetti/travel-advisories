Medical facilities in Uganda are limited and only equipped to handle minor medical emergencies. Surgical capabilities are inadequate, and blood supplies may be insufficient. Outside Kampala, hospitals are scarce and offer only basic services. Travelers should carry their own supplies of prescription drugs and preventive medicines.

[A list of medical providers](https://ug.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) is available at the U.S. Embassy website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

For emergency services in Uganda, **dial 999**.

Ambulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Embassy of Uganda](https://ug.usembassy.gov/) to ensure the medication is legal in Uganda. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Air Quality:**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Uganda. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season (December-February and June-July). People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
