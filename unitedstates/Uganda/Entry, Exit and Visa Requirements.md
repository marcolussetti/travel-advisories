# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens intending to travel to Uganda for holiday, tourism, business, study, visit, and/or medical treatment are required to apply and obtain a visa online **in advance of travel** on the [Government of Uganda’s Electronic Visa/Permit Application System website](https://visas.immigration.go.ug/). U.S. citizens who have recently attempted entry without completing the electronic visa process in advance of their travel have been refused boarding by the airlines and/or entry into Uganda. The U.S. Embassy is not able to assist U.S. citizens in gaining entry to Uganda.

All travelers to Uganda must have a valid yellow fever immunization card.

For the most up-to-date visa information, including fees, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Uganda at 5911 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20011; telephone (202) 726-7100 or visit their [website](https://washington.mofa.go.ug/). Travelers may also contact the [Permanent Mission of the Republic of Uganda to the United Nations](https://newyork.mofa.go.ug/contact) in New York. Overseas, inquiries can be made at the nearest Ugandan embassy or consulate.

Ugandan immigration imposes a fine of approximately $30 per day for visa overstays and may detain individuals who overstay their visas until the fine is paid. Employment permits are required. Working without a valid permit in Uganda may result in fines and/or detention. Be aware that the Ugandan immigration officer at the port of entry determines the length of authorized stay, which is generally from two weeks to three months for tourists. Immigration policies are not always consistently applied and may change without notice. Extensions of duration of stay may be requested at Ugandan immigration headquarters, Jinja Road, in Kampala. For more information on immigration issues, please see [the Directorate of Citizen and Immigration Control website](https://www.immigration.go.ug/) or call + 256 414 595 945. Avoid any offers by private individuals claiming that they can assist with visa issues.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Uganda or foreign residents living in Uganda.

Some airlines require travelers to Uganda to present the physical credit card used to purchase the plane tickets upon checking in at the airport before they can receive a boarding pass. Check with your airline for more information.
