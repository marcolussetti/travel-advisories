# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Currency**: U.S. currency notes in denominations less than $100 may be exchanged at a less favorable exchange rate. Travelers cannot exchange or use U.S. currency printed earlier than 2006. Western Union, MoneyGram, and other types of money transfer facilities are available in Kampala and other cities throughout the country. ATMs are available, but many only function for customers who have an account with a specific Ugandan bank.

**Charities/NGOs**: U.S. citizens planning to work for or donate money to an NGO should have the charity provide references of past volunteers whom they may contact. U.S. citizens have reported intimidation and harassment by directors of organizations when questioned about the organization's activities or use of donated funds.

Information about registering an NGO can be obtained from the Ugandan NGO Bureau, which has offices within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They can be reached at (256) (0) 414 253 446. If a Certificate of Good Conduct/Criminal Background Check is needed to start or work for an NGO, you can obtain it by contacting your local police or on [the FBI website](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks) before traveling.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: Accessibility to public transportation may be difficult for those with mobility issues. Foot paths and road crossings present barriers. There are no free or reduced taxi fares, or other accommodations in communication, lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafes, bars, or other tourist spots for disabled tourists.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers**: See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**LGB Travelers:**The May 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) includes penalties up to life imprisonment for consensual same-sex relations and capital punishment for crimes of “aggravated homosexuality” (such as serial offenders). Youth under the age of 18 could be prosecuted and imprisoned for multi-year sentences. LGB persons, including youth, may be subject to forced conversion therapy. LGB persons, or persons perceived to be LGB, could face harassment, imprisonment, blackmail, and violence, with heightened risk surrounding the passage of the AHA; The public is required to report to the police a person suspected of committing or intending to commit acts enumerated in the law. Hoteliers are not permitted to knowingly provide rooms to individuals who may commit acts deemed illegal in the AHA. Individuals or organizations viewed as publicly supporting the dignity and human rights of LGB persons could be prosecuted and imprisoned for multi-year sentence, including those that attend a same-sex marriage either inside or outside of Uganda’s borders. LGB organizations or those that advocate for the human rights of LGB persons may be deemed illegal under the law.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details.  
 **Importation of Healthcare Products**: Individuals and organizations seeking to bring or import healthcare products, including medicines and medical devices, are responsible for ensuring the importation is in accordance with the Uganda National Drug Policy and Authority Act. This includes donated products intended to support medical assistance efforts. The importation of expired products is prohibited, and many products require a market authorization issued by the Uganda National Drug Authority to be legally imported. Prohibited items are subject to seizure and importers can face criminal and civil action. Inquiries and applications for import authorizations should be sent to the Uganda National Drug Authority via [ndaug@nda.or.ug](mailto:ndaug@nda.or.ug).
