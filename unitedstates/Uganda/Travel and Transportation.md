# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Nighttime travel should be avoided whenever possible. Highway travel at night is particularly dangerous, including on the roads between Entebbe Airport and Kampala. The Embassy recommends caution on these roads and use of a reliable taxi service to and from the airport. With the exception of the Kampala-Entebbe airport road, U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from driving after dark on roads outside the limits of cities and large towns. Alcohol is frequently a contributing factor in road accidents, particularly at night.

Pedestrians often walk in the roads and may not be visible to motorists. Large branches or rocks in the road sometimes indicate an upcoming obstruction or other hazards. Ugandan law requires that the drivers stop and exchange information and assist any person injured in an accident. Mob anger and violence against the driver perceived to be at fault may occur. In these instances, Ugandans often do not get out of their cars, but drive to the nearest police station to report the accident.

Road conditions in the rural areas are poor. The use of four-wheel drive vehicles is encouraged in Uganda, and vehicular accidents occur at a high rate. Masaka Highway has been identified as one of the most dangerous roads in the world.

**Public Transportation**: Most inter-city transportation in Uganda is by small van or large bus. Many drivers of these vehicles have little training, and some are reckless. Vans and buses are often poorly maintained, travel at high speeds, and are the most common vehicles involved in the many deadly single- and multi-vehicle accidents along Ugandan roads. Accident victims have included U.S. citizens traveling in vans and personal cars, as passengers on motorcycle taxis locally known as "boda bodas," and as pedestrians. U.S. Mission employees and their dependents are prohibited from using boda bodas and matatus (minibus taxis) due to accident and crime risks. Large trucks on the highways are often overloaded with inadequately secured cargo and poor braking systems.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Uganda, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Uganda’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
