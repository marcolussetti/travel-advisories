# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Cuban penalties for the following are particularly severe:

* Possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs.
* Suspicion of assisting Cubans to leave the country illegally.
* Drivers involved in accidents that result in injury or death, regardless of fault.
* Importing weapons or ammunition.
* Photographing military or police installations or personnel, or harbor, rail, or airport facilities.
* Crimes against minors.

The Government of Cuba does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of Cuban-born U.S. citizens who maintain residency in Cuba and may not allow U.S. consular access to Cuban-American prisoners.

**Telecommunications:**  Many U.S. mobile service carriers provide roaming services in Cuba.  Your U.S. mobile phone will work in Cuba if your mobile phone is capable of roaming in Cuba and your mobile service provider has an international roaming agreement with ETECSA, Cuba's state-owned telecommunications provider.  Currently AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile have roaming agreements with ETECSA. Wi-Fi is often slow and unreliable. Be sure to confirm your carrier’s coverage before traveling.

SIM cards with a data plan can be purchased at Havana-José Martí International Airport (HAV) and local ETESCA telecommunications offices. To ensure family and friends can reach you in Cuba, check with your mobile provider about roaming options and cost or purchase a Cuban SIM card. See the [FCC Travel FAQs](https://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cuba-travel-faqs.pdf) for more information.

**Cuba-related Travel Transactions:**Only persons whose travel falls into the [12 OFAC approved travel categories](https://cu.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/traveling-to-cuba/#:~:text=The%2012%20categories%20of%20authorized,%3B%20religious%20activities%3B%20public%20performances%2C) or who have received a specific license from OFAC are authorized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to travel to, from, or within Cuba.  Direct financial transactions with certain entities and sub-entities under the control of, or acting for or on behalf of, the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services are also generally prohibited. For more information see the Department of State’s ﷟[Cuba Restricted List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/cuba-restricted-list/).  Additionally, lodging, paying for lodging, or making reservations on behalf of others to lodge, at certain accommodations in Cuba are prohibited; for a full list of such accommodations, see the [Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/cuba-prohibited-accommodations-list/cuba-prohibited-accommodations-list-initial-publication/).   For more information about licenses, visit OFAC’s [Cuba Sanctions website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/cuba.aspx).   Additionally, lodging, paying for lodging, or making reservations on behalf of others to lodge, at certain accommodations in Cuba are prohibited; for a full list of such accommodations, see the [Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/cuba-prohibited-accommodations-list/cuba-prohibited-accommodations-list-initial-publication/).   For more information about licenses, visit OFAC’s [Cuba Sanctions website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/cuba.aspx).

**Licenses for Remittances:**  In [June 2022, OFAC published updated Cuba-related regulations](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220608).  The new regulations eliminated a cap on remittances to family members in Cuba, and authorized remittances to non-family recipients as well.  Certain [Prohibited Officials of the Government of Cuba](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-C/section-515.337), [Prohibited Members of the Cuban Communist Party](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-C/section-515.338), and the close relatives of these two groups, are not eligible to receive remittances.  For information on remittance authorizations, see OFAC’s [Cuba Sanctions website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/cuba.aspx).

**What May Be Brought Back From Cuba:** Importation of Cuban merchandise for commercial purposes is restricted, with very limited exceptions.  Certain imports of goods produced by independent Cuban entrepreneurs are authorized, as set forth on the Department of State’s [Section 515.582 List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/#Section515582) (see 31 C.F.R 515.582).  There are no limits on the import or export of informational materials.  For more information related to imports, including merchandise entering the United States for personal use as accompanied baggage, please see the [CBP Public Notice](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/cbp-public-notice-process-imports-cuba).

Cuban law requires foreigners to obtain authorization to remove souvenir paintings and sculptures out of Cuba. Most authorized points of sale, such as galleries and art studios, should be familiar with this process and should provide the proper documentation at the time of purchase.  You can also apply for an export permit via the Cuban Fund of Cultural Assets. Travelers without a valid export permit may have their items confiscated at the port of departure. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist in these cases.  For more information, please contact the [embassy of Cuba](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/usa/embassy-cuba-usa).

Travelers may purchase alcohol and tobacco products while in Cuba for personal consumption in Cuba, but may not enter the United States with alcohol and/or tobacco products acquired in Cuba.  
  
Persons subject to United States jurisdiction may purchase or acquire Cuban-origin merchandise for personal consumption, including alcohol and tobacco products, while in a third country, but may not import such products into the United States.  For a complete description of what this general license authorizes and the restrictions that apply, see [31 CFR § 515.585(c) and (d).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.585)

**Currency Restrictions:** Be advised that policies concerning the use and convertibility of U.S. dollars in Cuba are subject to change.  Obtaining U.S. dollar cash is nearly impossible through official channels.  The Cuban Central Bank prohibits certain U.S. dollar cash transactions, including conversion of U.S. dollars to Cuban pesos, the use of U.S. dollars for cash payments, including in government-run establishments such as hotels and restaurants, and the purchase of pre-paid debit cards.. **U.S.-issued credit and debit cards do not work in Cuba.  Travelers should bring sufficient cash for the duration of their trip, and consider bringing multiple currencies, such as Euros.**
