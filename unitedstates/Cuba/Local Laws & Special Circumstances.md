# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the country, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

The Government of Cuba does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of Cuban-born U.S. citizens who maintain residency in Cuba and may not allow U.S. consular access to Cuban American prisoners.

Cuban penalties for the following are particularly severe:

* Possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs.
* Suspicion of assisting Cubans to leave the country illegally.
* Drivers involved in accidents that result in injury or death, regardless of fault.
* Importing weapons or ammunition.
* Photographing military or police installations or personnel, or harbor, rail, or airport facilities.
* Crimes against minors.

**Telecommunications:** Many U.S. mobile service carriers provide roaming services in Cuba. Your U.S. mobile phone will work in Cuba if your mobile phone is capable of roaming in Cuba and your mobile service provider has an international roaming agreement with ETECSA, Cuba's state-owned telecommunications provider. Currently AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile have roaming agreements with ETECSA. Wi-Fi is often slow and unreliable. Be sure to confirm your carrier’s coverage before traveling.

SIM cards with a data plan can be purchased at Havana-José Martí International Airport (HAV) and local ETESCA telecommunications offices. To ensure family and friends can reach you in Cuba, check with your mobile provider about roaming options and cost or purchase a Cuban SIM card.

Cuba-related Travel Transactions: Only persons whose travel falls into the [12 OFAC approved travel categories](https://cu.usembassy.gov/services/traveling-to-cuba/) or who have received a specific license from OFAC are authorized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to travel to, from, or within Cuba. Direct financial transactions with certain entities and sub-entities under the control of, or acting for or on behalf of, the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services are also generally prohibited. For more information see the Department of State’s [Cuba Restricted List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-sanctions/cuba-restricted-list/). Additionally, lodging, paying for lodging, or making reservations on behalf of others to lodge, at certain accommodations in Cuba are prohibited; for a full list of such accommodations, see the [Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List](https://www.state.gov/cuba-prohibited-accommodations-list-initial-publication/). For more information about regulations and licenses, visit OFAC’s [Cuba Sanctions website](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions).

**Licenses for Remittances:**OFAC regulations impose no cap on remittances to family members in Cuba and authorize remittances to non-family recipients as well. Certain [Prohibited Officials of the Government of Cuba](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-C/section-515.337), [Prohibited Members of the Cuban Communist Party](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-C/section-515.338), and the close relatives of these two groups, are not eligible to receive remittances. For information on remittance authorizations, see OFAC’s [Cuba Sanctions website](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions).

**What May Be Brought Back from Cuba:**Importation of Cuban merchandise for commercial purposes is restricted, with very limited exceptions. Certain imports of goods produced by independent Cuban entrepreneurs are authorized, as set forth on the Department of State’s [Section 515.582 List](https://www.state.gov/division-for-counter-threat-finance-and-sanctions/the-state-departments-section-515-582-list) (see [31 C.F.R 515.582](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.582)). There are no limits on the import or export of informational materials. For more information related to imports, including merchandise entering the United States for personal use as accompanied baggage, please see the [CBP Public Notice](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/cbp-public-notice-process-imports-cuba).

Cuban law requires foreigners to obtain authorization to remove souvenir paintings and sculptures out of Cuba. Most authorized points of sale, such as galleries and art studios, should know this process and should provide the proper documentation at purchase. You can also apply for an export permit via the Cuban Fund of Cultural Assets. Travelers without a valid export permit may have their items confiscated at the port of departure. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist in these cases. For more information, please contact the [Embassy of Cuba](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/usa/embassy-cuba-usa).

Travelers may purchase alcohol and tobacco products while in Cuba for personal consumption in Cuba but **may not** enter the United States with alcohol or tobacco products acquired in Cuba.   
   
Persons subject to United States jurisdiction may purchase or acquire Cuban-origin merchandise for personal consumption while in a third country, but may not import Cuban-origin alcohol or tobacco products into the United States, even for personal consumption. For a complete description of what this general license authorizes and the restrictions that apply, see [31 CFR § 515.585(c) and (d).](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.585)

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Storm Season:** Tropical storms and hurricanes between May and November can produce heavy winds and rain.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of Gay and Lesbian events in Cuba. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2022.

See our [Gay and Lesbian Traveler Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Cuba prohibits discrimination based on disability, however registering complaints to the Cuban government is often ineffective. Havana's older infrastructure presents challenges for individuals with mobility needs. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Many attractions and cultural sites, especially museums, are not well-equipped for people with mobility considerations, and wheelchair users may find cobblestone streets, especially in older areas, challenging. Accessibility for individuals with disabilities outside of Havana is very limited. Accessibility can be further impacted by a shortage of assistive devices and frequent power outages.

**Women Travelers:** See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Currency Restrictions:** Be advised that policies concerning the use and convertibility of U.S. dollars in Cuba are subject to change. Obtaining U.S. dollar cash is nearly impossible through official channels. The Cuban Central Bank prohibits certain U.S. dollar cash transactions, including conversion of U.S. dollars to Cuban pesos, the use of U.S. dollars for cash payments, including in government-run establishments such as hotels and restaurants, and the purchase of pre-paid debit cards. U.S.-issued credit and debit cards do not work in Cuba. Travelers should bring sufficient cash for the duration of their trip, and consider bringing multiple currencies, such as euros.
