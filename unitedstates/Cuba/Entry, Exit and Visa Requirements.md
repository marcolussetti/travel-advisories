[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulates travel to and from Cuba for all persons under U.S. jurisdiction. Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction for purposes of the OFAC regulations include, among others, U.S. citizens or residents anywhere and any person within the United States. For travel covered under the [12 travel categories authorized by a general OFAC license](https://cu.usembassy.gov/services/traveling-to-cuba/), you do not need to obtain a license from OFAC for the travel-related transactions. For travel not covered by a general license, you must seek OFAC authorization in the form of a [specific license](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions) to authorize the travel. Travelers who fail to comply with regulations may face penalties and criminal prosecution. For travel-specific questions, please see [31 C.F.R. 515.560](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b5ee59d94ee45bba6a049240298f1cff&mc=true&node=se31.3.515_1560&rgn=div8)and [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions).

Cuba requires visitors to have non-U.S. medical insurance, which is usually included in airline ticket prices on flights originating in the United States. If you do not have insurance, it can be purchased upon arrival to Cuba at an airport kiosk. Asistur Medical Insurance is the official company that airlines contract. Please confirm your coverage with your airline prior to arrival in Cuba and seek additional medical insurance if needed.

Cuba does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of Cuban-born U.S. citizens who maintain residency status in Cuba. The Cuban government requires Cuban dual nationals to enter and depart Cuba using Cuban passports. Cuban-born U.S. citizens who maintain their residency status in Cuba will be treated as Cuban citizens by the government of Cuba and may be subject to Cuban restrictions and legal obligations. Under U.S. law, all U.S. citizens must enter the United States with their U.S. passport and must carry their U.S. passport when traveling to Cuba.

HIV/AIDS Restrictions: There are no HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to and foreign residents of Cuba. Foreign students on scholarships must test for HIV/AIDS. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Cuba](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/usa)before you travel.
