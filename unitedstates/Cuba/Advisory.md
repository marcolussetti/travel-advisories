Updated to reflect information on power grid failures and [Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions) (OFAC) licenses for travel.

Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to**crime** and **unreliable electrical** **power**.

**Country Summary:** Petty crime is a risk for travelers in Cuba. This includes pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins. Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is also on the rise in Cuba.

U.S. law and regulation prohibit travel to, from, or within Cuba for tourist activities. OFAC regulates travel to, from, and within Cuba by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, defined to include, among other things, all U.S. citizens or residents (wherever located) and anyone in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and nationality. Failure by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to act consistently with the regulations may result in penalties and criminal prosecution. Travel to Cuba without an OFAC license is illegal.

Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators running during a long outage due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel.

U.S. citizens in Cuba or those planning to visit should check local news often to stay up to date. In Cuba, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests or demonstrations.

U.S. Embassy employees must follow a special notification process with the Government of Cuba to travel outside of Havana. This process can impact the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in Cuba during emergencies.

If a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction travels to Cuba consistent with 1 of the [12 travel categories](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.560) authorized by a general OFAC license, the person would not need to apply for a specific OFAC license for the travel transactions. For non-tourist travel that is not otherwise covered by a general license, a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction must seek a specific license from OFAC to authorize the travel. For travel questions, check [31 C.F.R. 515.560](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.560) and [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/cuba-sanctions).

If you decide to travel to Cuba:

* Stay aware of your surroundings.
* Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.
* Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.
* Prepare for prolonged power outages by:
  + Keeping mobile phones and portable battery banks charged.
  + Having flashlights and spare batteries easily accessible.
  + Stocking up on nonperishable food and water.
  + Preparing alternative methods to meet your medical needs (medical devices requiring power, medicines requiring refrigeration, etc.)
* Obtain any required OFAC licenses as it is illegal to travel to Cuba without an appropriate license.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](http://step.state.gov/) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
