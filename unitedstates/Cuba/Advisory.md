Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to**crime**.

**Country Summary:** Petty crime, such as pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins, is a threat for tourists in Cuba.  Also, violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, sometimes occurs in Cuba.

Travel outside of the Havana area for U.S. Embassy employees requires a special notification process which may affect the Embassy’s ability to provide emergency assistance to U.S. citizens in Cuba.
