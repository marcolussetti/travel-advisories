# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The security environment in Cuba is relatively stable and characterized by a strong military and police presence.  Demonstrations are infrequent but can draw violent responses from government forces.  Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning.  Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Demonstration Alerts are posted on the [Embassy’s website](https://cu.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).  Review the [Cuba Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/cuba-travel-advisory.html).

The Cuban government has detained U.S. citizens suspected of engaging in activities perceived to undermine state security.  **The Cuban government may detain individuals for activities that would not be considered criminal or offensive in the United States.**

**Crime:**  With the recent influx of travelers, there has been an increase in the number of property crimes. Crimes of opportunity, such as pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins, are on the rise. **Exercise vigilance everywhere**. Do not display large amounts of cash.  Do not leave your valuables unattended.  Carry money in your front pockets, hold your purse and cellular phone securely and be mindful of purses or bags when dining out.

* Do not leave a beverage unattended or accept beverages from persons unknown to you.
* Locations such as Habana Vieja, Playas del Este, Varadero, and other attractions tend to have a higher incidence of property crime than other parts of Cuba.
* Be wary of misdirection schemes where someone attempts to gain your attention while another comes from behind to steal your purse, wallet, or other valuable items.
* If confronted by criminals, do not resist, try to remain calm, clearly display your hands and do not make any sudden moves that could be interpreted as resistance.
* Carry a cell phone with Cuban cellular service for emergency communications and travel in groups if possible.
* Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night or when traveling in an unfamiliar area.
* While in your car, place valuables out of sight or in a locked trunk.  When unattended, avoid leaving items in the car, especially on the seat or in plain view.
* Only use marked taxis.
* Carry a copy of your passport and secure the original.
* Beware of scam artists, who may speak English and appear friendly.
* When exchanging currency, use the state-run offices known as CADECAs or official banks.

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are strongly encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, even basic medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens should maintain health insurance in Cuba.  If stays exceed 30 days,[CM1] U.S. citizens should purchase medical insurance when they process their visa extensions.
