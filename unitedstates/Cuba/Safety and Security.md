# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Cuba’s security environment is relatively stable and characterized by military and police presence. Demonstrations are infrequent but can draw violent responses from government forces. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn confrontational without warning. Avoid demonstrations and always maintain security awareness. Demonstration Alerts are posted on the [Embassy’s website](https://cu.usembassy.gov/).  Review the [Cuba Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/cuba-travel-advisory.html).

The Cuban government has detained U.S. citizens suspected of engaging in activities perceived to undermine state security. The Cuban government may detain individuals for activities not considered criminal or offensive in the United States.

**Crime:** Deteriorating economic conditions have led to an increase in crime. Crimes of opportunity, such as pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins, are becoming more frequent and confrontational. Violent crime is on the rise, including robbery with weapons, assault, and home invasion. Exercise vigilance everywhere. Do not display large amounts of cash. Do not leave your valuables unattended. Carry money in your front pockets, hold your purse and cellular phone securely, and be mindful of purses or bags when dining out.

* Do not leave a beverage unattended or accept beverages from persons unknown to you.
* Locations such as Habana Vieja, Playas del Este, Varadero, and other attractions tend to have a higher incidence of property crime than other parts of Cuba.
* Beware of misdirection schemes where someone gains your attention while another steals your purse, wallet, or other valuable items while you are distracted.
* If confronted by criminals, do not resist, try to remain calm, clearly display your hands and do not make any sudden moves that could be interpreted as resistance.
* Carry a cell phone with Cuban cellular service for emergency communications and travel in groups if possible.
* Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night or when traveling in an unfamiliar area.
* While in your car, place valuables out of sight or in a locked trunk. When unattended, avoid leaving items in the car, especially on the seat or in plain view.
* Only use marked taxis.
* Carry a copy of your passport and secure the original.
* Beware of scam artists, who may speak English and appear friendly.
* When exchanging currency, use the state-run offices known as CADECAs or official banks.

**Scams:**Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Cuba. Review the Department of State’s [Tips to Protect Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** There is no expectation of privacy in Cuba. Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Due to limited internet access in Cuba, downloading an offline map is recommended. Stand-alone GPS devices are not allowed in Cuba.

**Dating Apps:** Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police by dialing 106 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +53 7839-4100. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Infrastructure:** Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators operating during long outages due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections of equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities, and it may be substandard, as equipment and medical supplies are often unavailable. First responders cannot reach areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance and should maintain health insurance in Cuba. If stays exceed 30 days, U.S. citizens should purchase medical insurance when they process their visa extensions. Review our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
