# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road accidents are Cuba’s leading cause of death. Many involve pedestrians and bicyclists. Cuban authorities may prohibit drivers from leaving the country until claims associated with an accident are settled. Drivers found responsible for accidents resulting in serious injury or death may receive long prison sentences. U.S. citizen drivers are often found at fault for accidents they are involved in.

Drive with extreme care. Major streets are generally well-maintained, but secondary streets are not. Major potholes and obstacles are common on all roads. Bridges can collapse after heavy rains. Damaged bridges may not be well marked.

Outside of major cities or during blackouts, avoid driving at night. Emergency lights or signals are rare, making it virtually impossible to detect hazards after dark. Street signage is insufficient and confusing. Many Cuban cars are old, in poor condition, and lack reliable safety equipment. Rolling blackouts may leave streets dark and without traffic lights, even in major cities.

The principal Cuban east-west highway is in good condition but extends only part of the way from Havana to the eastern end of the island. Hazards—including unfenced livestock and farm vehicles—are common.

When traveling by road, you should carry a printed map of the area, as electronic (smartphone) maps frequently fail due to connectivity issues.

**Traffic Laws:** Speed limits are sometimes posted. Passengers in automobiles must wear seatbelts, if available. Motorcyclists must wear helmets. Traffic from major roads generally does not stop when entering roundabouts. Use care at intersections: stop signs are often hard to see. If involved in a traffic accident in Cuba, you must report the incident to local authorities, and you should obtain a copy of the police report (called a ‘Comprobante de Denuncia’). You may be detained until the case is resolved, and depending on the severity of the accident, you may face legal consequences, including possible imprisonment if serious injuries or fatalities occur.

**Public Transportation:** Buses designated for tourist travel, both between and within cities, generally meet international standards.

The public bus and rail systems are in poor condition. Public buses used by Cubans, known as "guaguas," are crowded, unreliable, and are sometimes preyed upon by petty criminals. There is a heightened threat of pickpocketing on crowded buses and trains. Embassy personnel are advised to avoid public transportation.

Avoid using informal taxis or hailing private vehicles for rides as they are unregulated. The vehicles are often in disrepair and usually do not have normal vehicle safety equipment such as seat belts and air bags. “Cocos,” smaller, yellow ball-shaped “tuk-tuk” style vehicles, are not safe, and the Embassy advises its personnel not to use them.

Rental car agencies provide roadside assistance to their clients as a condition of rental contracts. Travelers should not permit unauthorized people to drive their rental vehicles.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Cuba’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using any commercial airline for domestic flights within Cuba due to safety concerns. The Embassy prohibits its employees to travel via Cubana Airlines.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Cuba should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories).  Information may also be posted to the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website. The U.S. Coast Guard determined Cuban ports do not have effective anti-terrorism measures. Vessels that arrive in U.S. ports from Cuban ports must meet additional U.S. Coast Guard conditions of entry as described in the current Port Security Advisory, [International Port Security Program - Port Security Advisory](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Prevention-Policy-CG-5P/Inspections-Compliance-CG-5PC-/International-Domestic-Port-Assessment/International-Port-Security-Program-Port-Security-Advisory/).  Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Cuba should exercise caution.
