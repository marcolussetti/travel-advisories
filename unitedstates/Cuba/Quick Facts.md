### Quick Facts

PASSPORT VALIDITY:

6 months beyond arrival date.

BLANK PASSPORT PAGES:

Two pages are required for entry/exit stamps.

TOURIST VISA REQUIRED:

Yes, for a variety of short-term travel purposes. Travel to Cuba for tourist activities remains prohibited by U.S. statute. Review the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA) [22 U.S.C. 7209](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title22-section7209&num=0&edition=prelim) ,the Cuban Assets Control Regulations [(31 C.F.R. 515.560)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-515/subpart-E/section-515.560) and [OFAC's Frequently Asked Questions](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information).

VACCINATIONS:

None. See [CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/cuba?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) for recommendations.

CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR ENTRY:

U.S. credit and debit cards do not work in Cuba. You should bring U.S. dollars or euros to Cuba and exchange them for Cuban Pesos (CUP) at authorized banks, CADECA (official currency exchange houses) offices, airports, or hotels. Travelers should confirm alternative payment options before traveling because Cuban policies concerning the use of U.S. dollars in Cuba may change. The Cuban government requires that travelers declare cash amounts over the equivalent of $5,000.

CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR EXIT:

When departing Cuba, we advise U.S. travelers to spend or exchange CUP to a foreign currency before reaching airport security checkpoints. CADECA in the departure area at airports are currently open and CUP cannot be converted outside Cuba. International airlines flying to the United States include departure fees and taxes in the price of airline tickets. U.S. dollars are not accepted for payment by airlines for additional fees (baggage fee or other airline service charges) purchased at the airport. Each airline handles payment of fees differently; for example, some airlines require fees to be paid with a local currency credit card, and others use a local mobile app. Under Cuban law, travelers may take up to the equivalent of $5,000 out of the country. To depart with more cash than this, a traveler must show that the currency was acquired legitimately from a Cuban bank.
