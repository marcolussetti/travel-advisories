For emergency services in Cuba, dial:

* 104 for an ambulance or contact the nearest [hospital](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/NEWadoptionassets/pdfs/LOCAL%20HOSPITALS_Mar2025.pdf) directly
* 105 for fire
* 106 for police

Ambulance services are

* not present throughout the country and are unreliable where available
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment
* not usually staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

See our [Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) page for more information.

* Check the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Traveler Advice for [Cuba](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/cuba?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).
* Review all sub-sections. These include Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center). CDC Traveler Advice provides advice on medical considerations including:
* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
* Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
* General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors in Cuba do not accept U.S. health insurance. Most hospitals require payment up front before services are rendered.

**Medical Insurance:** Ensure your airline ticket includes health insurance. Cuba requires all U.S. airlines departing the United States to pay for health insurance for each passenger. The health insurance from airlines is valid for 30 days upon your arrival in Cuba. If you are planning to stay in Cuba for more than 30 days, you will need to extend your coverage before you can extend your visa. It is important to keep a record of your arrival into Cuba, such as your airline ticket, so that the Asistur Medical Insurance agency can coordinate with the hospital on payment.

See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

Medical evacuation flights from Cuba are difficult to arrange, with costs starting at $15,000.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Ensure you have all medicine you require for your time in Cuba. Medicine (prescription and over the counter) is not available in Cuba.  Due to the unavailability of pharmaceuticals in Cuba it is highly recommended that you bring insect repellant, sunscreen, anti-diarrheal medication, anti-bacteria creams, pain relievers (Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen), and any prescription medication. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging. Check with the [Embassy of Cuba](https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/usa/embassy-cuba-usa) to ensure the medication is legal in Cuba. Note: This site is in Spanish only.

Diarrheal illness is common among travelers, even in luxury accommodations. Travelers should wash their hands, drink bottled water, and avoid street and undercooked foods.

The following diseases are prevalent:

* Dengue Fever
* Oropouche
* Hepatitis-A
* Traveler’s diarrhea
* Chikungunya
* Covid-19

**Vaccinations**: Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution is a problem in several major cities in Cuba. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Cuba.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the spring. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, teens, and older adults
* People with heart disease and lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals [here](https://cu.usembassy.gov/services/medical-assistance/hospitals-pharmacies/).  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Even the most common over the counter medications are not available in Cuba. Other medications, medical equipment, or supplies are also unavailable on the island. If you can find medicine, exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Water Quality:** Tap water is not potable. Bottled water is often unavailable for purchase, and you should be aware that some restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**General Health Issues:** There are severe shortages of food, potable water, medicine, medical supplies, etc. throughout Cuba.
