For emergency services in Ecuador, dial 911.

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country and unreliable in most areas except Quito.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance, particularly outside of Quito.

Adequate medical and dental care is available in major cities. In smaller communities and in the Galapagos Islands, services are limited, and the quality is generally well below U.S. standards.

* Ambulance service is limited.
* Specialized medical care can cost tens of thousands of dollars or is not available.
* Pharmacies are widely available. However, some medications might not be offered, and brand names will differ from products in the United States. Not all pharmacies purchase medications from pharmaceutical companies that adhere to quality control standards.
* Exercise caution if you explore herbal and folk remedies.
* Quito is 9,400 feet above sea level. Some other tourist destinations in the mountainous region may be higher. Consult your doctor for recommendations concerning medication and lifestyle tips at high altitude.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of Ecuador’s [National Customs Service](https://www.aduana.gob.ec/viajeros-por-via-aerea-aeropuerto/) to ensure the medication is legal in Ecuador.

The following diseases are present:

* Chagas disease
* Chikungunya
* Dengue
* Malaria
* Tuberculosis

**Vaccinations**: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/ecuador?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Ecuador.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

The U.S. Mission in Ecuador maintains a list of doctors and hospitals on its [webpage](https://ec.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/medical/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general**:

* Adequate health facilities are available in Quito and Guayaquil but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Ecuador to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is legal for foreigners in Ecuador.

**Water Quality:**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**

* Many cities in Ecuador, such as Quito, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel.
