# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in Ecuador are severe. Offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Never agree to carry a suitcase or package through customs for anyone.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see the State Department’s website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Seismic Activity:** There are numerous active volcanoes, and earthquakes are common. Earthquakes can trigger deadly tsunamis. Visit [Ecuador’s National Risk Management Secretariat](http://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/) and the [Ecuadorian Geophysical Institute](http://www.igepn.edu.ec/) for more information.

* Mud or lava flows from **Tungurahua volcano** could pose a significant and immediate threat to travelers in Baños.
* The town of Latacunga is directly in the path of potential mud or lava flow from the **Cotopaxi volcano**. Even small emissions from the volcano can trigger avalanches and landslides. Low lying areas in the greater Quito area could also be affected if Cotopaxi erupts.
* **Reventador volcano** is located in Napo province and is one of the most active in the country.
* Sangay volcano is located in Morona Santiago province is active and local authorities advise against approaching the volcano and nearby Upano river.
* In the event of a natural disaster, pay attention to the news media for updates. A disaster can disrupt food supply, so plan to have at least a 3-day supply of food and medicine on hand.
* See the [Centers for Disease Control website](http://www.cdc.gov/disasters/) for information on emergency preparedness and response.

**Hallucinogens:** Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or San Pedro, are often marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States, Ecuador, and many other countries. Health risks are not well understood, and, on occasion, people suffer serious illness or death after taking these drugs. Intoxicated travelers also have been assaulted and robbed. These incidents often occur a great distance from medical facilities, making the risks even greater.

**Galápagos** **Islands:** Be aware of the following challenges:

* Many Ecuadorian tour vessels operating in the Galápagos do not meet international safety standards. Inquire about safety features when boarding vessels.
* The two hospitals on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal Islands do not perform major medical procedures.
* Serious injury or illness in the Galapagos typically requires medical evacuation to the Ecuadorian mainland or the United States. This can cost $60,000 or more and take significant time to arrange. **We strongly recommend you purchase travel insurance that includes health coverage and air evacuation**.
* There are limited decompression facilities for scuba divers.
* The Ecuadorian government restricts the entry of certain items into the Galapagos. Visit the [Agency for Biosecurity and Quarantine Regulation and Control for the Galapagos](https://bioseguridadgalapagos.gob.ec/lista-de-productos/) for more information.

**Retiring in Ecuador:**In recent years, Ecuador has become a top overseas destination for retiring U.S. citizens.

* U.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers, real estate agents, and others, resulting in costly losses and little hope of remedy through the local judicial system.
* **Ecuadorian rules governing visas and customs are subject to change with little notice.** The Ecuadorian government publishes little information in English. The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate General cannot give detailed advice about Ecuadorian immigration law.
