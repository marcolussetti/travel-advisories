**Country Summary:** Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.

Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure.

Outside of Ecuador’s major towns and cities, much of the country’s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.

**Land Border Restrictions**: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the [Ministry of Tourism’s webpage](https://www.turismo.gob.ec/requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-continental-e-islas-galapagos/) and at [Ecuador.Travel](https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/). All U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should comply with this requirement. See [Travel.State.Gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html)’s [Office of Authentications webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/office-of-authentications.html) and [Criminal Records Check webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/criminal-record-checks.html) for information on how to obtain a criminal record check and apostille from the United States. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General in Ecuador cannot assist citizens crossing a land border in obtaining the required documentation.
