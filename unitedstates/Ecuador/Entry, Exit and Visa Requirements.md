# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Contact the Embassy of Ecuador in Washington, DC, for the most current visa information.

If you are traveling for **business or tourism, you do not need a visa for stays of up to 90 days** in any 12-month period. You can request an extension through provincial migration offices. Additional information is available on the [Ecuadorian Ministry of Interior website](https://www.ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec/servicios-de-apoyo-migratorio-sam/).

* If you are planning a visit longer than 90 days, you must obtain a visa in advance.
* The Ministry of Tourism provides general information for travelers on its [website](https://www.turismo.gob.ec/recomendaciones-para-turistas-nacionales-y-extranjeros/).
* You must carry identification, including proof of U.S. citizenship. Carry a photocopy of your passport (including the entry stamp and/or visa) with you at all times.
* If your passport is lost or stolen while you are in Ecuador, you should obtain a police report and apply for a new passport at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General. We also recommend obtaining an entry/exit report from an Ecuadorian immigration office before leaving the country. For further information, see the [Ecuadorian Ministry of Interior website](https://www.ministeriodegobierno.gob.ec/servicios-de-apoyo-migratorio-sam/).
* U.S. citizens born in Ecuador are required to show an Ecuadorian passport or national ID card upon entering and exiting Ecuador.
* U.S. citizen children born in Ecuador who are traveling without one or both parents must present a copy of a birth certificate and written authorization from the absent parent(s). If the parent is deceased, a notarized copy of the death certificate is required. For more information, contact the Embassy of Ecuador in Washington, DC.
* While no specific vaccinations are required for entry, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommends travelers obtain certain immunizations. See the CDC [website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/ecuador?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) for more information.
