# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Some roads are poorly maintained and may lack crash barriers, guard rails, signs, and streetlights. Heavy fog and rain make conditions more treacherous.

* Due to a lack of sidewalks, many roads are also used by pedestrians.
* Slow-moving buses and trucks frequently stop in the middle of the road unexpectedly.
* In rural areas, you may encounter livestock in the road.
* Many vehicles are poorly maintained, and breakdowns are common.

**Traffic Laws:**

You may use your U.S. driver’s license for up to 90 days. If you are staying in Ecuador longer, you should contact the [National Transit Agency](https://gobecuador.com/ant/) to obtain a valid driver’s license.

* Drivers often disobey traffic laws and signals. They rarely yield to pedestrians and cyclists.
* **If you are involved in an accident, even if you are not at fault, you may be taken into police custody,** especially if there are injuries or if you do not have insurance. If the injuries or damages are serious, you may face criminal charges.
* You might encounter intoxicated drivers. Chances of a drunk-driving accident are higher on weekends and Ecuadorian holidays.
* If you want to import a vehicle, contact [Ecuador’s National Customs Service](https://www.aduana.gob.ec/para-importar/) for local regulations. You must pay for local liability insurance, called SPPAT.

**Public Transportation:**Intra- and inter-city bus passengers are often targets of crime, including robbery and sexual assault.

* Armed criminals have been known to board local city buses and rob passengers.
* Numerous bus accidents occur every year in Ecuador. Many buses are overcrowded, poorly maintained, and lack safety features such as seat belts.
