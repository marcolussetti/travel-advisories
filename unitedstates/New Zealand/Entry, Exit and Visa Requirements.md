[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA):**

* U.S. citizens traveling to or transiting through New Zealand under the visa waiver program are required to have an [NZeTA](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/nzeta). This is also true for cruise ship passengers. It can take up to 72 hours to process an NZeTA so apply well in advance of your trip. The NZeTA is valid for multiple visits for up to two years.
* If your NZeTA application is denied, you will need to apply for a visa. Visit the [Embassy of New Zealand website](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/countries-and-regions/americas/united-states-of-america) for the most current visa information.

**International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL):**

* U.S. citizens traveling to New Zealand for tourism, certain student programs, and short-term business trips are required to pay an [International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL).](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/your-journey-to-new-zealand/before-you-travel-to-new-zealand/paying-ivl) This levy is assessed when a person applies for an NZeTA or New Zealand visa. The IVL is not required of passengers that are transiting New Zealand on a transit visa or transit ETA.

**Arrival Information:**

* A customs officer at the port of entry into New Zealand may examine items such as mobile phones, iPads, Android tablets, hard drives, laptops, and digital cameras. The officer may ask for your password or ask you to enter it. Fines of up to NZD $5,000 may be enforced for failure to comply. Passwords are not kept, nor is personal data altered.

All biosecurity-risk goods must be declared or disposed of in marked amnesty bins at airports and seaports. If you do not declare goods considered to be a biosecurity risk, such as honey, fresh fruit, seeds, and plants, you can receive an immediate fine of NZD $400.
