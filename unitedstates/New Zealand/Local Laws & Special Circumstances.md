# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in New Zealand are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

In New Zealand, driving under the influence could land you in jail. Roadside sobriety checks by police are common. The blood alcohol limit in New Zealand is lower than that in most U.S. states.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate General immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Natural Disasters and Weather Conditions:** Natural disasters occur in New Zealand and include earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, and cyclones. In addition, weather conditions can change quickly leaving you stranded or injured, particularly if you are in an isolated area.

* Monitor meteorological websites such as the [Joint Typhoon Warning Center](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html).

On December 9, 2019, the volcano on Whakaari/White Island erupted while tourists were visiting. This led to numerous casualties, including deaths of U.S. citizens. The volcano remains active and further eruptions are possible. **Avoid** Whakaari/White Island and follow the advice of local authorities.

There are many areas in New Zealand with active volcanoes. Tourists are encouraged to visit [GeoNet](https://www.geonet.org.nz/) for up-to-date information on volcanic alert levels, as well as other geological hazards in New Zealand. As always, follow the advice of local authorities.

The National Emergency Management Agency provides timely information to citizens and visitors through an [Emergency Mobile Alert](https://getready.govt.nz/prepared/stay-informed/emergency-mobile-alert/). This service is broadcast from local cell towers to all capable phones in the area and is designed to provide targeted messaging to areas affected by serious hazards. Messages will only be sent when there is a serious threat to life, health, or property.

**Adventure Sports:** Injuries and death can result from participating in extreme adventure sports, such as bungee jumping, sky diving, hiking, rappelling, climbing, motorcycling, and kayaking. Use caution and common sense when engaging in these activities. Make sure you have travel medical insurance and that it covers your sport.

Never participate in adventure sports alone. Always carry identification and let someone else know where you are at all times. Before kayaking, check the river conditions and wear a life jacket. When hiking, rappelling, or climbing, carry a first aid kit and know the location of the nearest rescue center.

Visit the [New Zealand Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/) website for advice and direction on how to safely and legally hike, bike, etc. in New Zealand.

**Imports:** New Zealand is an island nation, and the government is serious about preserving its delicate ecosystem. The [Ministry for Primary Industries](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/) (MPI) strictly regulates what can be imported into New Zealand.

* If you do not declare goods that could be quarantined, you can be fined up to NZD $100,000 and/or face up to five years in prison.
* If you do not declare goods considered to be a biosecurity risk, such as honey, fresh fruit, seeds, and plants, you can receive an instant fine of NZD $400.
* When importing a pet, you will need thorough veterinary documentation, and a quarantine period will be required.
* The MPI may seize and destroy unfinished wood products, used hiking shoes, gardening tools, fresh food items, and items such as used pet carriers. Thoroughly clean any hiking equipment or sports gear prior to your arrival in New Zealand.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in New Zealand prohibits discrimination against persons with physical disability or impairment; any other loss or abnormality of psychological or anatomical structure or function; reliance on a guide dog, wheelchair, or other remedial means; and the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing illness. The law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and access to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure.

* Every new building and major reconstruction in New Zealand must provide "reasonable and adequate" access for individuals with disabilities, but be aware that most buildings pre-date this requirement. Most facilities have wheelchair access.
* Many transport operators can provide accessible transport, but most need advance notice so you may want to call ahead to describe your needs. Mobility parking permits are available.
* If you are planning a holiday and need information on facilities for individuals with disabilities, please visit the [New Zealand Tourism](https://www.tourismnewzealand.com/) website.
* Rental, repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices may be limited. Service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are available in many areas.
* For more information on the availability of disability services in New Zealand, please visit the disability section of the New Zealand [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/services-and-support/disability-services/more-information-disability-support/disability-organisations-and-websites) website.
