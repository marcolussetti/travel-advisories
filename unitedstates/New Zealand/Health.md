Travelers and crew do not need pre-departure tests or proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter New Zealand. Please check with your airline or cruise provider as they may still require proof of vaccination.

For emergency services in New Zealand, dial **111**.

Ambulance services and quality medical care are widely available in New Zealand. Waiting lists exist for certain types of treatment. Access to medical care may be less available in rural areas.   
   
We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. If they do not, consider emergency or comprehensive traveler’s insurance. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of New Zealand regulations at [New Zealand MedSafe](https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/medicines/medicines-landing.asp) to ensure the medication is legal in New Zealand.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
