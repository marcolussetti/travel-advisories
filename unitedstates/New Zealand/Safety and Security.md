# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** The crime rate in New Zealand fluctuates between geographic locations however overall, it is **relatively low**. Theft from cars, recreational vehicles, and hostels is common, especially in areas frequented by tourists. Theft, fraud, drug sales and violent crime do occur, however, tourists are often not the intended target.

Do not leave passports or other valuable items in unattended vehicles.

Violent crime against tourists is rare; however, if you are traveling alone, you should remain vigilant and be cautious in secluded areas.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in New Zealand. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Grandparent/Relative targeting

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

If you are on the Cook Islands, the emergency police number is 999.
