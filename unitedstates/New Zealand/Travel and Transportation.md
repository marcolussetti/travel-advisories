**Road Conditions and Safety:** While in New Zealand, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States.

Renting a car or a camper is a popular way to enjoy New Zealand's natural beauty, but if you are unfamiliar with local conditions, you should be extremely careful. New Zealand has only 100 miles of multi-lane divided motorways. Most intercity travel is on narrow, two-lane roads. While these roads are in good condition, New Zealand's rugged terrain means motorists often encounter sharper curves and steeper grades than those found on the U.S. Interstate Highway System.

* Use caution to avoid animals when driving in rural areas.
* There is very limited cell phone coverage on large portions of scenic highway in the South Island, which is remote and has little traffic.
* Drivers are advised to review the driving rules and regulations beforehand. For example, pedestrians do not have the right of way except in crosswalks. New Zealand law requires that cars stop at least two meters (approximately 6 feet) from a crosswalk that is in use. Additionally, there is no left-hand turn allowed at a red light. Drivers are reminded to remain cognizant of turning to the left (counterclockwise) when entering traffic circles.

**Traffic Laws:** All traffic moves on the left in New Zealand, and you should exercise extra caution if you are accustomed to driving on the right.

* Driving on the wrong side of the road is a leading cause of serious injury and death for U.S. tourists.
* Make sure to follow the posted speed limit signs. The speed limits are much lower than those in the United States.
* Proceed carefully through intersections. Traffic circles are common throughout New Zealand. When approaching a traffic circle, always yield to traffic coming from the right--noting that traffic already in the circle has the right-of-way--and merge to the left into the circle. Left turns on a red traffic signal are not permitted.
* New Zealand prohibits driving while texting as well as driving while using a cell phone.

**Public Transportation:** New Zealand has public transport systems in all major cities and some towns. The public transportation system in New Zealand is generally easy to use and reliable.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of New Zealand’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
