# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**:  Driving conditions in Peru are very different from those found in the United States, and can be considerably more dangerous. Visitors are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with local law and driving customs before attempting to operate vehicles.

* Roads are often poorly maintained and may lack crash barriers, guard rails, signs, and streetlights.
* Fog is common on coastal and mountain highways, making conditions more treacherous.
* Slow-moving buses and trucks frequently stop in the middle of the road unexpectedly.
* Road travel at night is particularly hazardous. Due to safety concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling on mountainous roads at night.
* Traveling in a group is preferable to solo travel. Spare tires, parts, and fuel are needed when traveling in remote areas, where distances between service areas are long.

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, creating dangerous conditions for drivers and pedestrians.

* Seat belts are mandatory for driver and front-seat passengers in a private vehicle.
* It is against the law to talk on a cellular phone while driving, and violators may be fined.
* When driving in urban areas, taxis and buses often block lanes impeding traffic.
* Directional signals are often not used, and vehicles frequently turn from the middle through traffic lanes.
* While driving outside major cities and on the Pan-American Highway, you must drive with your lights on.
* If a traffic officer signals you to stop, you must stop.
  + Traffic officers must wear uniforms and identification cards that include their last name on their chest.
  + Traffic officers are not allowed to retain your personal identification or vehicle documents.
  + Under no circumstances should you offer or agree to pay money to traffic officers.
* If you are involved in an accident, you MUST contact local police and remain at the scene without moving your vehicle until the authorities arrive. This rule is strictly enforced, and moving a vehicle or leaving the scene of an accident may constitute an admission of guilt under Peruvian law.
* If your car is a rental, call the agency or representative of the insurance company provided by the rental agency.
* Always carry your driver's license, a copy of your passport, and the rental agreement when you drive a rental car.
* International driver's licenses are valid for one year, while driver's licenses from other countries are generally valid for 30 days.

**Public Transportation**: Many buses are overcrowded, poorly maintained, and lack safety features such as seat belts.

* Bus accidents resulting in multiple deaths and injuries are common due to routes along narrow, winding roads without a shoulder and steep drop-offs.
* Accidents are frequently attributed to excessive speed, poor bus maintenance, poor road conditions, and driver fatigue.
* Individuals should use private taxi companies or car-share applications when traveling as opposed to hailing taxis on the side of the road for safety.
