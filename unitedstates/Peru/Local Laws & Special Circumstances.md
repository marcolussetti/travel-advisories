# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

**Ayahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens:** Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as “ceremonies” or “spiritual cleansing,” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States and many other countries.

* Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances.
* Health risks associated with ayahuasca are not well understood, and, on occasion, U.S. citizens have suffered serious illness or death after taking these drugs.
* These incidents often occur in remote areas and far away from modern medical facilities, making the risks even greater.

**Drugs**:

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Peru are severe.
* Offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions with significant expense for themselves and/or their families.
* Never agree to carry a suitcase or package through customs for anyone.
* Peru uses strict screening procedures for detecting narcotics smuggling at its international airports.

**Customs Currency Regulations**:

* $30,000 USD or its equivalent in cash or negotiable items is the maximum allowed for entry or exit.
* Any amount in excess of $10,000 USD must be declared and the legal source proven.

**Artifacts**:

* Peruvian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes.
* U.S. customs officials are required to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States.

**Animal Products/Plants**:

* Avoid products made of wild plants and animals, as many are of illegal origin and may involve protected or endangered species, whose sale and export are illegal.
* Peruvian authorities will seize any protected species that is sold or transported, either live or transformed into food, medicinal beverages, leather, handcrafts, garments, etc.
* Some products, including live animals, require special permits when leaving Peru.
* Knowingly importing into the United States wildlife or plants that were taken from the wild or sold in violation of the laws of Peru (or any other country) is a violation of the Lacey Act (16 USC § 3371).

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances**: Many popular destinations in Peru are remote. These areas have few facilities that are able to provide advanced or emergency medical care.

* Local rescue capabilities are severely limited. Many mountain areas are too high for helicopters to reach safely. Accidents or injuries while hiking or climbing are common; crisis responders may take hours or even days to reach you if they are traveling over great distances and/or rough terrain.
* When using tourist company services, travelers are encouraged to use qualified and licensed operators. Many do not meet international safety standards. Inquire about safety standards prior to engaging in adventure activities. The Ministerio de Comercio Exterior y Turismo (Tourism Ministry) website provides information on tourism companies.
* Always check with local authorities before traveling about local geographic, climatic, health, and security conditions that may impact your safety.
* Be aware that you may not have access to phone or internet for days at a time. Check in with family prior to going to remote areas and leave detailed written plans and timetables. Use of a personal GPS beacon is encouraged.

**Seismic Activity**:  Earthquakes are common throughout Peru. On May 26, 2019, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck the Loreto region of Peru. One fatality in the Cajamarca region and 11 injuries as well as isolated power outages and some infrastructure damage were reported.

* Visit Peru’s [National Emergency Operations Center (COEN)](https://www.gob.pe/10140-instituto-nacional-de-defensa-civil-centro-de-operaciones-de-emergencia-nacional-coen) for more information.
* In the event of a natural disaster, monitor local media and government agencies, including [IPeru](https://www.peru.travel/en/useful-data/iperu), the [Commission to Promote Peru for Exports and Tourism (PROMPERU)](https://www.gob.pe/promperu), and Peru’s [National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI)](https://www.gob.pe/senamhi) for updates.

**Legal Issues in Peru**:

* The legal system in Peru may require victims or their families to hire lawyers to advance their cases through the legal system, even for victims of serious crimes.
* U.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers and others, resulting in costly losses and little hope of remedy through the local judicial system.
* **Peruvian laws are subject to change with little notice**. The Peruvian government publishes little information in English. The U.S. Embassy cannot give detailed advice about Peruvian law.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Peru.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Peruvian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include ramps, special cashiers for those with disabilities, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, and common in lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference between Lima (and other large cities) and the rest of the country.

* Rental, repair, and replacement services are available for aids/equipment/devices.
* The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a list of translators*.*
