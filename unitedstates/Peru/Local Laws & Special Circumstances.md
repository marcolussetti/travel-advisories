# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should obtain information from the local authorities before you start.

**Ayahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens:** Traditional hallucinogenic drugs, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as “ceremonial” or “spiritual cleansers.” These drugs typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen, that is illegal in the United States and many other countries.

U.S. citizens have suffered serious illness or death after taking these drugs and have also been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances. Facilities or groups offering ayahuasca/kambo are not regulated by the Peruvian government and may not follow health and safety laws or practices.

**Drugs:** Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Peru are severe.

Offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions with significant expense for themselves and/or their families. Never agree to carry a suitcase or package through customs for anyone. Peru uses strict screening procedures for detecting narcotics smuggling at its international airports.

**Customs Currency Regulations:** $30,000 USD or its equivalent in cash or negotiable items is the maximum allowed for entry or exit. Any amount more than $10,000 USD must be declared and the legal source proven.

**Artifacts:** Peruvian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes.

U.S. customs officials are required to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States.

**Animal Products/Plants:** Avoid products made of wild plants and animals, as many are of illegal origin and may involve protected or endangered species whose sale and export are illegal.

Peruvian authorities will seize any protected species that is sold or transported, either live or transformed into food, medicinal beverages, leather, handcrafts, garments, etc.

Some products, including live animals, require special permits when leaving Peru. Knowingly importing wildlife or plants into the United States that were taken from the wild or sold in violation of the laws of Peru (or any other country) is a violation of the Lacey Act (16 USC § 3371).

Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** Many popular destinations in Peru are remote. These areas have few facilities that can provide advanced or emergency medical care.

Local rescue capabilities are severely limited. Accidents or injuries while hiking or climbing are common; crisis responders may take hours or even days to reach you.

When using tourist company services, travelers are encouraged to use qualified and licensed operators. See the [Ministerio de Comercio Exterior y Turismo (Tourism Ministry) website](https://consultasenlinea.mincetur.gob.pe/directoriodeserviciosturisticos/DirPrestadores/DirBusquedaPrincipal) for more information on licensed tourism companies. [IPeru](https://www.peru.travel/en/useful-data/iperu) also provides information on tour companies.

Before you travel, always check with local authorities about local geographic, climatic, health, and security conditions that may impact your safety.

Be aware that you may not have access to phone or internet for days at a time. Check in with family prior to going to remote areas and leave detailed written plans and timetables. Use of a personal GPS beacon is encouraged.

**Seismic Activity:** Earthquakes are common throughout Peru. Visit Peru’s [National Emergency Operations Center (COEN)](https://www.gob.pe/10140-instituto-nacional-de-defensa-civil-centro-de-operaciones-de-emergencia-nacional-coen) for more information. In the event of a natural disaster, monitor local media and government agencies, including [IPeru](https://www.peru.travel/en/useful-data/iperu) (Tourist Information and Assistance), the [Commission to Promote Peru for Exports and Tourism (PROMPERU)](https://www.gob.pe/promperu), and Peru’s [National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI)](https://www.gob.pe/senamhi) for updates.

**Legal Issues in Peru:** Victims or their families may need to hire lawyers to advance their cases through the legal system.

Peruvian laws are subject to change with little notice and U.S. citizens have reported unethical practices by lawyers and others in the judicial system. The U.S. Embassy cannot give detailed advice about Peruvian law and does not provide translation services.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a [list of translators.](https://www.gob.pe/462-traduccion-de-documentos-para-uso-oficial)

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Peru prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is not consistently enforced. The most common types of accommodations for physical disabilities include ramps, express lane cashiers in stores, and elevators. General accessibility accommodations are less common outside of Lima and other large cities. Public transportation throughout the country has limited accessibility accommodations.

Rental, repair, and replacement parts are available for assistive technologies and accessibility aids/equipment/devices.
