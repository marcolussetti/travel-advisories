# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

U.S. Embassy Lima enforces a Restricted Travel Policy for Embassy personnel traveling to the VRAEM (Valley of the Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers) and specific areas of the Colombian border, which is based on its assessment of conditions and developments throughout the country. See the [Overseas Security and Advisory Council’s Country Security Report for Peru](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/9b562a75-e082-4641-9167-1d336aa494c2). See the latest [Travel Advisory for Peru](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/peru-travel-advisory.html).

The VRAEM is particularly remote and a known haven for drug traffickers and home to the last operational remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group.

**Crime:** Crime is a widespread problem in Peru. All types of crime occur in Peru. The most frequent are robberies and pickpocketing. Notably, sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas.

* Travel in groups.
* Do not leave food or drinks unattended, and use caution if a stranger offers you food or drink.
* Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
* Cell phone theft is common. Keep your phone in a secure location when not in use to lower the chances of theft. Do not leave your cell phone unattended in public places. Avoid using your phone on the street or while walking. Use security features such as passcodes and tracking apps.
* Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Armed robberies have occurred in cities throughout Peru, including popular tourist destinations. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist.
* Incapacitating drugs, such as Rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate robberies and sexual assaults. Seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill or suspect you have been drugged.
* On routes to and from the airport in Lima, robberies have occurred where the assailant uses a tool to break a window while the vehicle is stopped in traffic. Keep your belongings in the trunk or out of sight. Authorized taxi booths are present at the airport in Lima that will charge a flat rate according to the destination.
* Use hotel safes, if available. Avoid wearing expensive jewelry or clothing. Carry only the cash or credit cards that you need.
* Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you.
* Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark.
* Be alert for robberies in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs.
* Use an app-based taxi service, order a taxi by phone, or use a service affiliated with a major hotel. Travelers have been assaulted or robbed after hailing an unknown taxi on the street.
* Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas such as banks or shopping malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time.
* Do not let your credit card out of your sight to avoid credit card “skimming.” You should expect the vendor to use a credit card reader in your presence. The vendor will ask for your passport or ID number on the receipt.
* To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view.

There is little government presence in many remote areas of the Andes and Amazon basin. Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common.

Drug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas.

 The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions.

**Demonstrations**occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams**: Internet romance scams and financial scams are prevalent in Peru.  Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations. If using a GPS app while walking, step into a store or building to consult the map as thieves target cell phone users in public areas.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 105 (National Police) or 0800-22221 (tourist police) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +51-1-618-2000. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely find appropriate medical treatment only in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
