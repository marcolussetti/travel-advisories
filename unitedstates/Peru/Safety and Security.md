# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

U.S. Embassy Lima enforces a Restricted Travel Policy for Embassy personnel, which is based on its assessment of conditions and developments throughout the country. See the Overseas Security and Advisory Council’s Country Security Report for Peru. See the latest [Travel Advisory for Peru](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/peru-travel-advisory.html).

The VRAEM (Valley of the Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers) is particularly remote and a known safe haven for narcotraffickers and the last operational remnants of the Shining Path terrorist group.

**Crime**: Crime is a widespread problem in Peru.

* **Sexual assaults and rapes can occur, even in tourist areas. Travel in groups, do not leave food or drinks unattended, and use caution if a stranger offers you food or drink.**
* Intoxicated travelers, including U.S. citizens, also have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
* Pick-pocketing, robbery, and hotel room theft are the most common crimes. Armed robberies have occurred throughout the city, including popular tourist destinations. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist.
* Incapacitating drugs, such as rohypnol and scopolamine, have been used to facilitate robberies and sexual assaults. Seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill.
* On routes to and from the airport in Lima, robberies have occurred where the assailant uses a tool to break a window while the vehicle is stopped in traffic.  Keep your belongings in the trunk or out of sight. Authorized taxi booths are present at the airport in Lima that will charge a flat rate according to the destination.
* Use hotel safes, if available. Avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or clothing, and carry only the cash or credit cards that you need.
* Stay alert in crowds and on public transportation. Be aware that thieves might create distractions to target you.
* Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark.
* Be alert for robberies in which criminals enter a taxi and force victims to withdraw money from ATMs.
* Use an app-based taxi service, order a taxi by phone, or use a service affiliated with a major hotel, as it is usually safer than hailing an unknown taxi on the street.
* Use ATMs in well-protected indoor areas such as banks or shopping malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts of cash at one time.
* Do not let your credit card out of your sight in order to avoid credit card “skimming.” You should expect the vendor to use a credit card reader in your presence. The vendor will ask for your passport or ID number on the receipt.
* To avoid carjacking or theft from your car while you are stopped at intersections, drive with your doors locked and windows rolled up. Do not leave valuables in plain view.

There is little government presence in many remote areas of the Andes and Amazon basin. Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common.

Drug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Financial scams are prevalent in Peru. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Money transfers
* Grandparent/Relative targeting

**Victims of Crime**:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy in Lima. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

* U.S. Embassy: +51-1-618-2000 (phone is answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week)
* Local police: 105 (National Police)
* Tourist Police: 0800-22221

**Domestic Violence**:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Telephone (answered 24 hours): +51-1-618-2000

**Tourism**: The tourism industry, including adventure activities (e.g. paragliding, sandboarding, etc.), is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. U.S. citizens are encouraged to pay attention to waiver and liability policies of tour companies, as they may vary or not exist. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
