# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Peru requires everyone entering the country to have passports valid for at least six months from the date of entry into Peru. Travelers with less than six months validity in their passports will be refused entry into Peru.
* Your approved length of stay will be determined by Peruvian border officials at the time of entry. Overstays result in fines you must pay to Peru to depart the country.
* The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist if you are denied entry into Peru. Airlines must return travelers who are denied entry to their point of origin.

**Requirements for Exit:**

* Make sure immigration officials record your entry into Peru upon arrival. An entry record (such as a passport stamp) is required even at remote land border crossings.
* If you do not have an entry record, you will not be allowed to exit the country until immigration authorities confirm the time and place of your entry into the country. This process can take several weeks for you to resolve through Superintendencia Nacional de Migraciones (Immigration). You will likely have to pay an exit fine and can be subject to a 15-year ban on re-entering Peru.
* Report lost/stolen passports to local police immediately and keep the report. You must apply for a new passport at the Embassy to depart Peru. You may be required to present your police report to immigration authorities upon departure.

**Travel with Minors:** Peruvian immigration procedures are complex for minors traveling without one or both parents/legal guardians.

U.S. citizen minors under the age of 18 traveling to Peru alone or with only one parent do not usually require additional documentation if entering as a tourist and staying for less than 183 days. If the stay lasts more than 183 days, or if they are dual U.S.-Peruvian nationals entering Peru with their Peruvian passport, they will require an "Autorización de Viaje para Menores de Edad" (Travel Authorization for Minors) to leave the country, regardless of the length of their trip. Please refer to [the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website](https://www.gob.pe/rree) for more information.  There are [very limited exceptions](https://busquedas.elperuano.pe/dispositivo/NL/2353462-2) to this rule.

An “[Autorización de Viaje](https://www.gob.pe/144-autorizacion-de-viaje-para-menores-de-edad)” is a written, notarized authorization issued by the Peruvian government with the approval and consent of the non-traveling parent. It can also be authorized by a Peruvian judge when the non-traveling parent is absent or missing. Peruvian immigration authorities will not accept a document notarized by the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. notary in lieu of an “Autorización de Viaje.”

You can get an “Autorización de Viaje” from a Peruvian notary or a judge, or overseas at a [Peruvian consulate](https://www.consulado.pe/paginas/Inicio.aspx). An apostilled U.S. birth certificate may be required for issuance of an “Autorización de Viaje.”

The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist travelers who are prevented from traveling for lack of an Autorización de Viaje.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Peru.
