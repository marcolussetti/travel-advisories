# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**COVID-19 Requirements**

* There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

**Requirements for Entry**:

* A passport with six months validity is required to enter Peru. Migraciones (Immigration) authorities may also require evidence of return/onward travel.
* Be sure your date and place of entry is officially documented by Migraciones, whether you arrive at a port, airport, or land border.
* Your length of approved stay will be determined by border officials at the time of entry, and can range from 30 to 183 days. Extensions for tourists are usually not approved, and overstays result in fines.
* The Embassy is unable to assist if you are denied entry. Peruvian immigration requires airlines to return travelers who are denied entry to their point of origin.

**Requirements for Exit**:

* If you do not have an entry record, you will not be allowed to exit the country until immigration authorities confirm the time and place of your entry into the country. This can be a difficult process, costing considerable time and money to resolve.
* Make sure Migraciones (Immigration) records your entry, and then save the record for your exit. An entry record is required even at remote border crossings, where often the proper officials are not present.
* Immediately report lost/stolen passports to local police and keep the report. You must apply for a new passport at the Embassy and obtain a replacement entry record from Migraciones using your police report prior to exiting Peru.

**Travel with Minors**: Regardless of nationality, all children who are traveling with both birth parents are required to have a valid passport and the necessary visa or citizenship of the country where they are traveling. Peruvian immigration procedures are complex for minors traveling without one or both parents/legal guardians.

For entry/exit from Peru, U.S. citizen minors under the age of 18, traveling alone (or with only one parent), generally do not require additional documentation if entering as a tourist for less than 183 days. However, if the stay lasts more than 183 days, then a Permiso Notarial de Viaje is required (see below).

U.S. citizen minors who are dual national Peruvians, traveling alone (or with only one parent), require a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. Furthermore, step-parents or guardians accompanying a dual U.S.-Peruvian citizen minor must provide a Permiso Notarial de Viaje from the non-traveling minorâ€™s parents (as listed on the birth certificate). Finally, if an accompanying parent has sole custody, legal documentation is required (such as a foreign court-approved custody document stating sole custody, a death certificate, a Peruvian court-approved document for travel, or a birth certificate listing only one parent).

A Permiso Notarial de Viaje is a written, notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent(s). Peruvian immigration will not accept a document notarized by the U.S. Embassy or a document notarized by a U.S. notary in lieu of a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. Please be aware that these authorizations are valid for 30 days and one trip only.

How to get a Permiso Notarial de Viaje:

* In the United States, at the nearest Peruvian Consulate. There are multiple [locations](http://www.consulado.pe/paginas/Inicio.aspx).
* In Peru, at most Peruvian notaries. An apostilled U.S. birth certificate is required for issuance.

**The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist travelers who are prevented from traveling for lack of a Permiso Notarial de Viaje.**

**HIV Restrictions**: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to, or foreign residents of, Peru.
