The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://pe.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Medical Care:**

* Strongly consider [travel insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) that includes coverage for emergency medical care.
* Specialized medical care can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and you are expected to pay in full at the time of discharge.
* Pharmacies are widely available. Some medications might not be available and brand names will differ from products in the United States.
* Exercise caution if you explore herbal and folk remedies.

For emergency services in Peru, dial 113.

Ambulance services are

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Lima and other major cities.
* Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

See our [Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) page for more information.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Review our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) page for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your prescription. Check with the [Peru Ministry of Health](https://www.digemid.minsa.gob.pe/) to ensure the medication is legal in Peru.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/peru?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Peru. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. Consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast). It uses AI, historical data, and global pollution models to create a 3-day air quality forecast for Peru.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens.
  + People over 65 years of age.
  + People with heart disease, diabetes, or lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.
  + People who work or are active outdoors.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Lima and other major cities. Health care in rural areas may not be the same as you would typically find in the United States.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Public and private hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is usually available. Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in larger cities. Hospital-based care is only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery in Peru.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Medical Tourism website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) for information on Medical Tourism. Find out about the risks of medical tourism and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Peru. Before you travel for medical reasons, talk to your doctor.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Peru.
* The quality of care varies widely at the many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities found in Peru. If you plan to undergo surgery in Peru, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, may have the wrong strength, or may have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) websites for more information.

Please review [Peru's rules on importing medication.](https://www.digemid.minsa.gob.pe/webDigemid/tramites-persona-natural/)

**Non-Traditional Medicine:**U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Peru. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Peru to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Artificial reproductive technology, including surrogacy, is largely unregulated in Peru and, by law, only permitted when the gestational mother and the biological mother are the same person. If you decide to pursue parenthood in Peru via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be aware that according to Peruvian law, the gestational mother is the legal mother and will be on the child’s birth certificate. Rectifying the birth certificate to reflect the biological mother can take a year or more. Individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**

* Many cities in Peru, such as Puno, Cusco, Arequipa, Ayacucho, and Huaraz, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. People with pre-existing medical conditions should talk with a doctor before traveling to high elevation. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).
