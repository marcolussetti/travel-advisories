**Medical Care**:

* Pharmacies are widely available. However, some medications might not be offered, and brand names will differ from products in the United States.
* Exercise caution if you explore herbal and folk remedies.

For emergency services in Peru, **dial 113**.

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Lima and other major cities. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Government of Peru](https://www.digemid.minsa.gob.pe/) to ensure the medication is legal in Peru.

**Vaccinations**: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**: Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://pe.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health Facilities in General:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in Lima and other major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is usually available. Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Private and public hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals if they do not have insurance.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**:

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Peru.
* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Peru.
* Although Peru has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Peru, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

Please review [Peru's rules on medication](https://www.digemid.minsa.gob.pe/).

* If you are considering traveling to Peru to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Peru, subject to complex local regulation.

* Many cities in Peru, such as Puno, Cusco, Arequipa, Ayacucho, and Huaraz, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel.
