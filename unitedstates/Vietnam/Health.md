Medical facilities in Vietnam, including emergency response services, frequently do not meet international standards and may lack medicine and supplies. We strongly recommend travelers purchase medical evacuation insurance before visiting Vietnam.

* Medical personnel generally speak little or no English. Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash payment for health services. You may obtain lists of local English-speaking physicians from the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City from our [website](https://vn.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).
* International health clinics in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City can treat minor illnesses and injuries, but more serious problems often require medical evacuation to other cities in the region.
* Although you can purchase many prescription and non-prescription medications at pharmacies, some common U.S. medications may not be available. You should bring adequate supplies of medications for the duration of your stay in Vietnam and ensure with the Ministry of Health that the medicine you need is allowed to enter Vietnam. You should carry a copy of your prescription if carrying medicine in a travel case or container.
* We strongly recommend travelers purchase medical evacuation insurance before visiting Vietnam.
* Travelers to Vietnam are at risk of the following diseases: Tuberculosis, Dengue Fever, Zika, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and HIV. You can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/vietnam).

**We do not pay medical bills.**

The U.S. government cannot pay medical bills and does not provide medical assistance. Also, be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

 Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept upfront payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). Visit the[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/vietnam) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. If covered by TriCare, check the TriCare website ([https://www.tricare.mil/](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Vietnam.html#ExternalPopup)) for additional information about overseas coverage.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation as it can cost many thousands of dollars. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**It is extremely important** that travelers have sufficient funds and/or insurance to cover any potential medical costs. Frequently hospitals will hold onto a patient’s passport as collateral for payment, and patients may have difficulty getting their passport back without paying their medical bills in full. Patients who do not pay their medical bills in full also run the risk of being barred from departing the country.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/vietnam) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in Vietnam’s major cities, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact that seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you.  Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City’s Air Quality Index (AQI) can be observed through “City” option on the upper right part of the page. The page provides AQI over the last 24-hour period as well as pollutant concentration and a downloadable historical document.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Vietnam. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
