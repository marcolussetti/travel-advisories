# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Mosquito Gulf and the Darien Region are particularly dangerous due to their remoteness and the presence of criminal organizations.

In the Darien region, most travel is by river or by footpath due to the scarcity of roads. There are reports of narco-traffickers, and other smugglers and criminals operating in the Panama-Colombia border area.

Access to the “Mosquito Gulf” region is almost exclusively by boat and/or aircraft. Sections of this coastline are reportedly used for narco-trafficking and other illicit activities.

**Demonstrations:** There are often demonstrations to protest internal Panamanian issues or, more rarely, manifestations of anti-American sentiment. Some demonstrations may result in blocked roadways or major highways including in locations popular with U.S. citizens. Panamanian National Police will generally not use force against peaceful demonstrations or roadblocks. While most demonstrations are non-violent, the Panamanian National Police have used tear gas and/or riot control munitions in response to demonstrations, particularly when roadways are blocked or aggression is used against the police.

**Beach and Maritime Safety:**  Many of Panama’s beaches on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are subject to large waves and dangerous currents. Conditions can change rapidly and drowning deaths occur. Few beaches feature lifeguards.

Boaters should be wary of vessels that may be transporting narcotics, other illicit materials, or might be involved in human smuggling operations. Packages containing narcotics have been found floating in the ocean or lying on remote beaches. Do not pick up or move these packages. Immediately report their location to the Panamanian authorities.

Local maritime search and rescue capabilities are limited. If you are experiencing an emergency at sea or know of someone who is experiencing an emergency off the coast of Panama, please contact the Panamanian authorities.

**Crime:**  Panama City, Colon, and Chiriqui province have the highest crime rates. Crimes include shootings, home invasions, rapes, armed robberies, muggings, and thefts. You should take the same precautions you would take in other big cities.

* Remove valuables from your car. Keep windows up and doors locked while driving.
* Use only licensed and registered taxis. Avoid taxis with passengers and instruct the driver not to pick up additional fares while en-route to your destination. Regular taxis are yellow in color. Many hotels also have “tourist taxis” that are not yellow but only pick up passengers in front of well-known hotels. Taxis in Panama do not use meters so agree on a fare before getting into the taxi.

**Victims of Crime:**  Report crimes to the local police by dialing 104 (National Police) or 511-9260 (Tourist Police in Panama City) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +507-317-5000.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Panama.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 104.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is often only available in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities, which limits their ability to provide urgent medical treatment in those areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
