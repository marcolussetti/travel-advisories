**The “Mosquito Gulf” and the Darien Region** are extremely remote and inaccessible areas. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, and other criminal activities occur here. Police and emergency services are extremely limited.

* The “Mosquito Gulf” is only accessible by boat or aircraft
* The Darien Region has few roads and is only accessible by river or on trails by foot.

The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these regions.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. Past demonstrations have disrupted travel and the availability of goods and services in some parts of Panama. Police have used tear gas and other riot control tools.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Beach and Maritime Safety:** Panama’s beaches on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts can have large waves and dangerous currents. Conditions can change rapidly, and drowning deaths occur. Few beaches have lifeguards.

Avoid boats that may be connected to drug trafficking, human trafficking, or other illegal activity. Packages containing drugs have been found in open water and on remote beaches. Never pick up or move unknown packages. Report them to the police.

Emergency search and rescue capabilities are limited. In a maritime emergency near the Panama coast, contact local police.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams exist in Panama.  Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Crime:**  Crime in Panama includes theft and residential break-ins. Crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and purse snatching can happen in tourist areas. Remove valuables from your car. Keep windows up and doors locked while driving.

**Victims of Crime:**  Report crimes to the local police by dialing 104 or 511-9260 for the tourist police in Panama City. Contact the U.S. Embassy at +507-317-5000. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities.
