**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Confirm whether your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Some care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/panama) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**: Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Panama. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/). For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Health facilities in general:** Adequate health facilities are available in Panama City but health care in rural areas may not be the same as you would typically find in the Unites States.

Private hospitals require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. After receiving care, bills must be paid in full.

* Costs can be well over $10,000, depending on the treatment.
* Most hospitals accept credit cards for hospital charges, but not for doctors’ fees.
* Hospitals often cannot accept credit card payments by phone or international wire transfers.

**Pharmaceuticals:** Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Most medications, except antibiotics, are available without a prescription in Panama. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**: If you are considering traveling to Panama to have a child through the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
