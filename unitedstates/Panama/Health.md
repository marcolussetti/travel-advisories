Panama City is known to have some [good hospitals and clinics,](https://pa.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) but medical facilities outside of the capital are limited. Hospitals in Panama are either private hospitals or government-run public hospitals. Private hospitals typically require payment of the anticipated costs of hospitalization prior to providing services and require payment of any additional costs upon release from the hospital. These costs can be in excess of USD$10,000-$20,000, depending on the nature of the treatment. In Panama, most hospitals accept credit cards for hospital charges, but not for doctors' fees and do not accept international wire transfers or credit card payments over the phone.

Except for antibiotics and narcotics, most medications are available without a prescription.

The 911-call center provides ambulance service in Panama City, Colon, and the Pan-American Highway between Panama City and Chiriqui. However, an ambulance may not always be available and given difficulties with traffic and poor road conditions, there may be a significant delay in response. There are private ambulance services available on a subscription basis.

**The U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
