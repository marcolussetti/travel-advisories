**Road Conditions and Safety***:* Traffic in Panama moves on the right like in the United States. Seat belts are required by law. Some road conditions in Panama are very different from those in the United States:

* Always carry identification. Police can detain you for not having identification.
* Be prepared to stop at unannounced checkpoints throughout Panama, especially at night.
* Traffic signals are less common throughout the country.
* Driving at night can be dangerous, especially on the old Panama City – Colon highway.
* Avoid bicycling on the streets.
* Driving is more dangerous due to flooding during the rainy season—April to December. Rain can wash out roads and make streets impassable.
* Roads may have no streetlights and be poorly maintained, with large potholes and cracks common.
* **Use caution on the Pan American highway** in Panama:
  + The highway is not well lit at night.
  + Road construction is common and often inconsistently marked by signs.
  + Roadblocks sometimes occur due to demonstrations. The highway ends at Yaviza in the Darién Region and does not continue to Colombia.

**Traffic Laws**:Foreigners can drive in Panama using a valid foreign driver license, but only for 90 days. Don’t drive anywhere in Panama without carrying a valid license. Using a cell phone while driving and driving while intoxicated or while drinking alcohol are illegal. Third-party liability auto insurance is mandatory, but many drivers are uninsured.

If a traffic accident occurs:

* Call the police immediately.
* Follow the law by moving your car off the roadway – you could be fined if you don’t.
* If no one is injured, take photos of both cars and exchange information with the other driver, if you feel safe to do so.
* Wait for police to arrive.

**Public Transportation**:  Public transportation should be used with caution. Thefts and pickpocketing sometimes occur.

Taxis in Panama typically are yellow. Hotels may have taxis to pick up passengers at popular hotels, and these taxis may not be yellow.

If you hire a taxi:

* Use a ride-sharing app or licensed and registered taxis.
* Avoid taxis with unknown passengers.
* Tell taxi drivers not to pick up other passengers.
* Agree to a fare in advance because taxis in Panama do not have meters.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Panama’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight.  FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Panama should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
