**Country Summary:** Crime occurs in Panama, including theft and residential break-ins. Crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and purse snatching can happen in tourist areas. The Embassy receives occasional reports of residential break-ins, especially during the holiday season.

Demonstrations periodically occur due to local issues and have disrupted some normal travel patterns in the past, including the flow of goods and services to some parts of the country.

If you decide to travel to Panama:

* Avoid demonstrations and large crowds.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans
* Be aware of your surroundings especially when traveling to remote areas.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
