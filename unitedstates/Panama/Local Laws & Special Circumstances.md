# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws.  If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. See our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

If you break local laws in Panama, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution, and the Embassy cannot get you out of jail or prison.  Keep in mind, if you are arrested for an offense, tried and convicted, you must be sentenced before you can be transferred to the United States to complete your sentence in the United States. This process can last three or more years.

**Carry Identification:** Anyone not bearing identification may be held and will be penalized by the Panamanian authorities. You should always carry your passport that contains the Panama entry stamp in case it is requested by Panamanian authorities.

**Drugs:** Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Panama are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**Property:** Exercise extreme diligence in purchasing real estate in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama has received numerous property dispute complaints. The complaints include lost property, broken contracts, and demands for additional payments, accusations of fraud and corruption, and occasionally threats of violence. More information can be found [here](https://pa.usembassy.gov/living-in-panama/#property).

**Customs Restrictions:** Panamanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning importation into or export from Panama of items such as firearms and ammunition, cultural property, endangered wildlife species, narcotics, biological material, and food products. Contact the [Panamanian Embassy](http://www.embassyofpanama.org/) for specific information regarding customs requirements.

Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available as you may also be breaking local law.
