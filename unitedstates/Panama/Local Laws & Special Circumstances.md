# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some offenses are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. See our website on [crimes against minors abroad](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

If you break local laws in Panama, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution, and the Embassy cannot get you out of jail or prison.  Keep in mind, if you are arrested for an offense, tried and convicted, you must be sentenced before you can be transferred to the United States to complete your sentence in the United States. This process can last three or more years.

**Carry Identification:** Anyone not bearing identification may be held and will be penalized by the Panamanian authorities. You should always carry your passport that contains the Panama entry stamp in case it is requested by Panamanian authorities.

**Drugs:** Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Panama are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**Property:** Exercise extreme diligence in purchasing real estate in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama has received numerous property dispute complaints. The complaints include lost property, broken contracts, and demands for additional payments, accusations of fraud and corruption, and occasionally threats of violence. More information can be found [here](https://pa.usembassy.gov/living-in-panama/#property).

**Customs Restrictions:** Panamanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning importation into or export from Panama of items such as firearms and ammunition, cultural property, endangered wildlife species, narcotics, biological material, and food products. Contact the [Panamanian Embassy](http://www.embassyofpanama.org/) for specific information regarding customs requirements.

Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available as you may also be breaking local law. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice has more information on this serious problem. For further information about customs regulations, please read our [Customs Information page](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items).

See the [Department of State](/content/travel/en/international-ftravel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers:** Same sex marriages are not conducted nor recognized in Panama. LGB individuals enjoy full legal rights in Panama. However, Panamanian law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and there is societal discrimination based on sexual orientation.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Panamanian law only mandates access to new or remodeled public buildings for persons with disabilities, which is being enforced for new construction. Handicapped parking is often available at many larger parking lots.
