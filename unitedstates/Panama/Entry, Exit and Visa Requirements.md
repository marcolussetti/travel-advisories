# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Panama](https://www.embassyofpanama.org/) website for the most current visa information. The following are required for entry:

* A passport valid for 3 months past entry your date.
* Proof of funds—$500 cash or equivalent.
* A return plane ticket.

**180-Day Stay**: U.S. tourists can stay in Panama for 180 days without a visa. This is strictly enforced. Confirm you receive an entry stamp in your passport when you arrive. For further information contact the [Government of Panama Migration Service](https://www.migracion.gob.pa/).

**Traveling with Children**: To exit the country with only one parent, Panamanian citizens and legal residents under 18, including dual citizens, must present notarized consent in Spanish from both parents. Both parents’ identification documents and the child’s birth certificate are also required. Written consent signed in the United States needs to be apostilled. Any child born in Panama typically acquires Panamanian citizenship at birth.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions**: Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Panama. Panamanian immigration does not require an HIV/AIDS test. The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any U.S. citizens who have been deported due to HIV/AIDS. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Panama](https://www.embassyofpanama.org/) before you travel.

**Arriving by Sea**: Immigration officials charge a $110 entry fee to travelers piloting their own boats and arriving as tourists. This fee is inconsistently enforced and can change without notice. The fee allows entry into Panama for 3 months and can be extended for up to 2 years.

* Contact [Servicio Nacional de Migracion](https://www.migracion.gob.pa/contactenos/) to confirm entry fees and procedures.
* Contact Sector Pacifico, where many U.S. citizens arrive by personal boat, at +507-521-0480 and +507-521-0479.
* If navigating private craft through the Panama Canal, contact the Panama Canal Authority at +507-272-4570 or visit the [Panama Canal Authority website](https://pancanal.com/en/maritime-services/vessel-eta-and-transit-booking/) to make an appointment.
