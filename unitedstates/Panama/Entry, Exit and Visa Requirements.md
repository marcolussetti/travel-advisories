# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Panama](http://www.embassyofpanama.org/) website for the most current visa information.

**Requirements for Entry:**

* **A passport** valid for at least three months past the date of entry.
* **A return ticket** to home country or onward destination.
* **Money** - either $500 in cash or its equivalent, or credit card, bank statement, letter of employment or travelers checks.
* **Criminal Record Restriction** - Panamanian immigration reserves the right to deny entry to any person with a criminal conviction.

**Requirements for Exit:**

**180 Day Stay**-Tourists can only remain in Panama for 180 days. This rule is strictly enforced by Panamanian immigration. Travelers must ensure that immigration officials place an entry stamp in their passport.  For further information contact the [Government of Panama Migration Service](http://www.migracion.gob.pa/).

**Traveling with Minors**- Minors (children under 18) who are Panamanian citizens (including dual citizens) or legal residents of Panama are required to present both parents’ identification documents, birth certificates, and notarized consent **(in Spanish)** in order to exit the country if not accompanied by both parents. The consent must also be apostilled if it was signed in the United States. A child born in Panama may automatically obtain Panamanian citizenship. Non-resident foreign minors are excluded from these provisions.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions**: Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Panama.  Panamanian immigration does not require an HIV/AIDS test. The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any U.S. citizens who have been deported due to HIV/AIDS.  Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Panama](http://www.embassyofpanama.org/) before you travel.

**Arriving by Sea**: The Servicio Nacional de Migracion is currently enforcing an entry permit fee of $110 for sea travelers piloting their own boats and arriving as **tourists**. This fee allows entry into Panama for a period of three months, and can be extended for up to two years through an approved application with the immigration authorities in Panama.  U.S. citizens navigating private craft through the Canal should contact the Panama Canal Authority at (011) 507-272-4570 or consult the [Panama Canal Authority web site](https://pancanal.com/en/) to make an appointment.
