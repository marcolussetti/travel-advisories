# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the country, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Samoa are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* In Samoa, driving under the influence is an arrestable offense.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Behavior modification facilities:**

* There is one known behavior modification facility operating in Samoa.
* Although this facility may be operated and staffed by U.S. citizens, the Samoan government is solely responsible for its compliance with local safety, health, sanitation, and educational laws and regulations. This includes all licensing requirements of the staff in the country.
* These standards may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of residential facilities in the United States.
* U.S. citizens may request assistance returning to the United States. We may also assist U.S. citizen minors in returning to the United States in certain circumstances. Contact the [U.S. Embassy in Apia](https://ws.usembassy.gov/) or the [Office of American Citizens Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/contact-us/Emergencies-Abroad.html)

**Stray dogs:** In Apia, and in many villages, stray dogs wander the streets.

* You should not approach or feed them. They can become aggressive in the presence of food or if they feel threatened.
* There have been several cases of attacks by more than one dog.
* Please exercise appropriate caution when you are walking, running, or riding a bike near stray dogs.

**Ferry service:**

* Vessels are sometimes overloaded.
* One of the multi-deck automobile ferries sometimes transports passengers on its automobile deck.
* To avoid injury, you should ride only in the passenger compartment. We do not recommend that you ride on the automobile deck during crossings.

**Blowholes:** Samoa has many “blowholes” (lava tubes open to the sea where wave action can produce geysers). These blowholes are popular tourist attractions. The footing around the mouths of most blowholes is very slippery. To avoid being swept in, you should keep a safe distance. Never stand between the opening of the blowhole and the sea.

**Financial transactions:** Businesses in Apia and resorts may or may not accept major credit cards (Visa, Master Card and American Express). Most gas stations and businesses outside of Apia only accept cash. You can get Samoan currency from ATMs located in Faleolo Airport, Salelologa, and many locations in Apia. For more information on ATM locations and banking services, visit the [ANZ Bank](https://www.anz.com/samoa/en/personal/) website or the [BSP](https://www.bsp.com.ws/) website.

**Disaster preparedness:**

* Samoa is located in an area of high seismic activity called the “Ring of Fire”. This area is subject to earthquakes which can trigger tsunamis.
* The rainy (or monsoon) season in the South Pacific is from November to April. Strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, and disruptions to services can occur.
* For information about tropical cyclone preparedness, visit our [Crisis and Disaster](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) Preparedness webpages, and [NOAA's Hurricane Preparedness Guide.](https://www.noaa.gov/hurricane-prep)
* For information about all types of natural disasters, visit the [CDC webpages](https://www.cdc.gov/natural-disasters/).

**Customs:**

* Samoan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations about importing or exporting items. These items include but are not limited to firearms, fruits, honey, pets and other animals.
* You should contact the [Samoan Mission to the United Nations](https://www.un.int/samoa/) bytelephone at (212) 599-6196 for specific information regarding customs requirements.
* You can also consult the [Samoa Ministry of Revenue](https://www.revenue.gov.ws/) website*.*

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations are a crime in Samoa, with prison terms of up to seven years. The Crimes Ordinance 1961 and the more recent Crimes Act of 2013 criminalize same-sex sexual relations.

* There is no recognition of same-sex relationships, marriage or adoption by same-sex couples in Samoa.
* There are also no anti-discrimination laws in place.

Seeour [**LGB Travel Information**](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: There are no laws pertaining specifically to the status of people with disabilities in Samoa. While most major hotels, restaurants, and cafes are renovating to better accommodate people with disabilities, expect accessibility to be limited in rural areas. Travelers with disabilities should clarify with the hotel what accommodations are available before they book.

Some family-based beach accommodations in the outer villages are also working to provide accessibility for disabled persons.

Many of the new multi-story buildings provide ramps and elevators, but older public buildings do not.

Blind individuals and persons in wheelchairs or on crutches may have difficulty navigating in and around Apia because of a limited number of stoplights and sidewalks.

Most buses and taxis do not accommodate wheelchairs.
