# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Urban and main roads in Apia and across the island are generally kept in fair condition, although bumps and potholes are common.
* Side roads tend to be gravel or dirt, and their condition varies considerably, particularly during the rainy season when ruts and bumps develop.
* In rural areas, the roads may be in poor condition which can make travel difficult. They are often narrow, winding, relatively steep, with no shoulders, and poor lighting. Please exercise increased caution when operating a vehicle in these areas.
* Flash flooding could occur, which makes the roads dangerous.

**Public Transportation:**

* Taxis are widely available.
* Some taxis are unlicensed. Only use taxis that are licensed.
* Buses are slow, crowded, uncomfortable, undependable, and rarely used by visitors.
* Rental cars are available but be aware that limited roadside assistance is available.
* Most major roads are paved, but secondary roads are predominantly dirt and gravel and may be rough and/or overgrown with vegetation.
* A four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended for travel on secondary roads.
* You should be aware that vehicle safety regulations are rarely enforced, and traffic violations occur routinely.
