e aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) page for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Samoa Ministry of Customs and Revenue](https://www.revenue.gov.ws/customs-procedures/) to ensure the medication is legal in Samoa.
