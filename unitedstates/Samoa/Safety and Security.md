# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**

* You should remain aware of your surroundings, lock your doors at night, and do not leave your belongings unattended.
* Incidents of petty theft and robberies are common in Samoa. Some incidents have involved residential break-ins.
* While rare, violent assaults, including sexual assaults, have occurred in Samoa. Remain alert near Apia’s downtown bars and restaurants. Some violent incidents involving foreigners and Samoans have occurred in that area. No specific groups have been targeted, and there have been no reported racially motivated or hate crimes against U.S. citizens.
* Police in Apia generally respond quickly to incidents. Dial 911 for emergency assistance. However, there is a very limited police presence elsewhere in Samoa. In areas outside of Apia order is maintained primarily by local village authorities. Police response outside of Apia is not as quick or reliable.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 21631. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipmentand facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find limited medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
