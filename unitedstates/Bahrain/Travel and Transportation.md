# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Road travel is generally safe. Highways and major roads in northern Bahrain are wide and well maintained. Roads in villages and older parts of Manama and Muharraq are narrow, congested and twisting.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Traffic moves on the right.
* At roundabouts (traffic circles), cars within the traffic circle have right of way over those attempting to enter.
* Drivers frequently speed despite stiff penalties, including fines and possible imprisonment.
* Police can detain drivers for traffic violations.
* It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving, though it is very common.
* Drivers are required to wear seat belts.
* Traffic is more congested on the weekends with an influx of vehicles from neighboring countries.

**Traffic Accidents:** Except for minor accidents, do not move the vehicle until you have filed a report with the traffic police. This applies to single-car accidents as well. If you move the car, insurance companies may deny coverage.

For minor accidents with no injuries, move your vehicle off the road to avoid further accidents. You do not have to wait at the scene for the police.

**Filing Accident Reports:** You must file a report within 24 hours of the accident.

* For minor accidents with no injuries, call 199.
* For accidents involving injury, call 999.
* For the traffic department’s main switchboard, call 1787-2222.

If an accident results in legal proceedings, both drivers may be prohibited from leaving the country until the matter is resolved. The traffic police will ask you to provide an identity card/document (passport), a driver’s license and a mobile number to assist with completing the accident report.

**Public Transportation:** Bahrain has a newly expanded public bus system that extends throughout most of the country. A car is still needed to access most locations.

Taxis are available in Bahrain and are typically arranged by phone. Some rideshare apps also operate in Bahrain.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Bahrain’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Bahrain’s air carrier operations.
