For emergency services in Bahrain, dial 999.

Ambulance services are:

* Widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Bahrain.

* Select your destination in the Travelers’ Health webpage.

* Review the [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) webpage that provides advice on medical considerations including:
  + Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
  + Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
  + General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

Payment at all medical facilities is due at the time of service. Some hospitals have very limited direct billing capability for certain insurance carriers. Billing and insurance practices vary.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Customs Affairs of Bahrain](https://www.bahraincustoms.gov.bh/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Bahrain. Most narcotic painkillers, stimulants, and controlled sedatives/hypnotics are not easily available, and may be illegal. Do not bring CBD oil or products to Bahrain.

**Basic medical care is available** through public and private hospitals, as well as private clinics. In some facilities, the care is below U.S. standards. Public hospitals have trauma and Intensive Care Units. Most postoperative and trauma centers do not provide adequate pain management. People with chronic general medical or mental health conditions and HIV-related health issues may not be able to obtain U.S standards of emergency care in Bahrain. U.S. privacy and confidentiality laws may not apply to Bahraini medical providers.

**Infectious Disease Considerations:** The Kingdom of Bahrain has strict rules on persons in country with HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B or C. Treatment for these conditions is not available locally. Expatriates are subject to deportation or expulsion from Bahrain if medical authorities discover evidence of their status, even if they are well controlled on medication or do not require treatment.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
