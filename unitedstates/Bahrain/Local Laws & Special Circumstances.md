# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Embassy officials can more readily visit you while you are still being detained at a police station than after you have been transferred to a prison. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information and our embassy website for a [list of local lawyers.](https://bh.usembassy.gov/legal-assistance/)

**Extra-marital sexual relations are a criminal offense.** If a child is born out of wedlock, obtaining a civil birth certificate is extremely difficult and, while rare, may lead to the deportation of the mother and the child. Without a birth certificate, obtaining a passport for the child can be difficult. Additionally, transmission of citizenship is typically through the father. You may contact the Embassy for more information.

**Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe**, including long jail sentences and heavy fines. You can be arrested for public drunkenness and disorderly behavior.

**Penalties for driving under the influence include imprisonment and/or heavy fines.** Any sign of alcohol consumption may be taken as evidence of driving under the influence.

Using vulgar language or hand gestures can result in heavy fines or criminal charges.

It is illegal to photograph certain buildings in Bahrain.

**Always carry a form of identification with you**, such as a passport, local ID card (CPR card), or driver’s license.

**Social Services:** Information concerning family and child services can be found on the [Ministry of Labor](https://www.mlsd.gov.bh/?lang=en) and [Ministry of Social Development](https://www.social.gov.bh/?lang=en) websites.

**Divorce:** Seek legal counsel and ascertain your rights in Bahrain before visiting the country if you are a U.S. citizen divorced from/in the process of divorcing a Bahraini citizen. This is particularly important regarding child custody issues. See our website on [Bahrain and international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/International-Parental-Child-Abduction-Country-Information/Bahrain.html) for additional information.

**LGB Travelers**: While there are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations between people 21 and over, LGB activities are not accepted by many Bahrainis. Some LGB travelers have reported difficulties entering Bahrain whose gender expression do not correspond to their assigned sex at birth. See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Bahrain prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Sidewalks and crosswalks—even in large cities—are not accessible. There are very few accessible restaurants, shops, or historical sites. Accessible bathrooms, even in major hospitals, are generally not available.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** Women traveling alone should maintain vigilance. Review this report’s section on Local Law, as well as our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).
