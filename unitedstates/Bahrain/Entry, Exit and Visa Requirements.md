# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport valid for at least six months
* Visa

**Types of visas:**

* *Tourist Visas*: Apply for two-week tourist visas at the [Bahrain eVisa website](https://www.evisa.gov.bh/) or upon arrival. Ask for ten-year multiple entry visas if applying through the Bahrain embassy.
* *U.S. Diplomatic and Official Passport Holders:*Diplomatic passport holders should coordinate their arrival with Embassy Manama. Official passport holders should follow their agency-specific guidance.
* *Journalism Visas:* Journalists must have a journalism visa. Please apply for a visa in advance of your travel.

Be prepared to answer questions regarding your purpose of travel. Be sure to leave Bahrain before your visa expires; otherwise, you will face heavy fines, possible arrest, and/or deportation. A visa extension to stay beyond the original expiration date is possible. An extension request must be submitted via the [Bahrain e-Visa website](https://www.evisa.gov.bh/). Your visa must be valid for the duration of your stay in Bahrain.

**To work in Bahrain you must have:**

* a valid work visa
* a residency permit
* a local identification card

Consult [Bahrain’s Labor Market Regulatory Authority](https://lmra.bh/portal/en/home) for complete details.

Obtain a valid work permit and signed employment contract before arriving in Bahrain. The contract should clearly state:

* Provisions related to relocation expenses
* Type of housing and number of occupants
* Any visa fees to be paid by the employee
* Salary payment schedule and any salary penalties
* Terms of probation period
* Who pays transportation expenses, should the contract be terminated
* Local tax obligations, if any
* Benefits offered including final settlement

**Do not work in Bahrain on a tourist visa.** Even if employers advise you otherwise, Bahraini authorities will hold you personally liable if you do not have a valid work permit.

**Have all documents required for your employment permit authenticated before arriving**. The U.S. Embassy in Manama cannot provide this service. For information on authentication of U.S.-issued documents, see [Authentication of American Academic Credentials for Use Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/apostille-requirements.html) and contact our [Office of Authentications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/office-of-authentications.html).

**Do not allow your employer to retain your U.S. passport.** It is illegal, but a common practice, for Bahraini employers to retain your passport. Such retention could delay your travel or grant undue leverage to your employer in case of a dispute.

While many U.S. citizens have a positive experience working in Bahrain, some employed in the education sector have complained about lack of private accommodations, delay in payment of salary, withholding of passports, delay in issuance of residency, and a debt-related travel ban on leaving the country if the employee breaks a contract and the sponsor requires repayment of travel costs.

**Exit Restrictions:** If you have unpaid debt or are involved in legal proceedings, authorities may not allow you to leave Bahrain until the issue is resolved. Resolution may take several years. Additionally, this could force you to stay in Bahrain beyond the validity of your visa, at which point you would begin to accrue daily fines. The U.S. Embassy cannot pay your debt, fines, tickets, legal expenses or living expenses.

**Residents intending to return to Bahrain should** **obtain a re-entry permit** valid for at least six months before leaving. Renew visas and residency permits through the [General Directorate of Nationality, Passports, and Residence (GDNPR)](https://www.npra.gov.bh/en).

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Bahrain. All declared HIV-positive foreigners risk immediate deportation. Although you are not required to declare HIV status upon arrival, the government may revoke visas of non-Bahrainis who are HIV positive. There may be a risk of getting tested for HIV without consent during a hospital visit. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain](https://www.mofa.gov.bh/washington/en/home/) before traveling.

**Travelers with HIV:** Carry enough medication to cover your intended stay. Pharmacies reportedly will not sell HIV/AIDS medication to non-Bahraini citizens without a permit from the Ministry of Health. Health facilities and pharmacies are required to report HIV-positive foreigners to the Ministry of Health, which could lead to deportation.

**Bahrain does not recognize dual nationality,** though some exceptions are made. Bahraini dual nationals are required to declare and register their second nationality with the government.

If you are eligible for Bahraini citizenship, authorities will not issue you a Bahraini passport unless you renounce your U.S. citizenship.

**Military Travelers:** Please consult the [Department of Defense's (DOD) Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG)](https://apacs.milcloud.mil/fcg/loginForm.cfm) prior to commencing travel to Bahrain. This applies to DOD Service Members, DOD Civilians, DOD Contractors, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel.
