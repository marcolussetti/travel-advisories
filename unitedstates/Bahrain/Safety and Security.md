# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime**: The crime rate in Bahrain is low, and violent crime is rare. Thieves and pickpockets are known to operate in the old market area. Common sense security precautions are effective in countering the threat of crime.

**Demonstrations**occur regularly in specific areas and are usually peaceful and not disruptive to public order**.** They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, during international events, at night and on weekends.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

Demonstrations sometimes result in temporary road closures. Demonstrators occasionally burn tires, throw rocks, or lob Molotov cocktails in specific neighborhoods at night. In the past, they have used improvised explosive devices and shotgun-like projectile launchers against government security forces. The Ministry of Interior maintains official checkpoints and will deploy crowd control agents against demonstrators if it is determined that the protest is becoming unruly or could impact public security. In recent years, dialogue and community policing elements have been used to lower tensions and crowd control measures have been deployed as a last resort.

No U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted during protest activity. Local media outlets have sometimes expressed anti-U.S. sentiment, and demonstrators have occasionally burned U.S. flags.

Remain alert to local security developments. For assistance, call the local police at 999.

**Restricted travel:** The U.S. Embassy restricts its employees from traveling to specific areas where protest activity is more likely and advises all U.S. citizens to do the same.

See the Embassy’s website for [travel restrictions](https://bh.usembassy.gov/services/) and [security updates](https://bh.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using GPS apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(973) 1724-2700 (business hours) or +(973) 1727-5126 (after hours). Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
