# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Department of State advises you to exercise increased caution when traveling to Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. See the Travel Advisory for Saudi Arabia [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/saudi-arabia-travel-advisory.html).

Do not travel:

* Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to terrorism and armed conflict.

Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.

Houthis operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh’s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Rebel groups are also in possession of unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) which they have used to target civilian infrastructure and military facilities in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens living and working on or near such installations, particularly in areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack.

On October 11, 2018 the Saudi General Authority for Civil Aviation issued a Notice to Airmen about threats to civil aviation and airports in Saudi Arabia posed by missiles and UASs launched from Yemen. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the U.S. Government’s Defense Internet NOTAM Service (Type “OEJD” in the search field, then click “View NOTAMs,” then scroll down to W0438/18 and click to view).

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to:

* Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran;
* Qatif in the Eastern province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.

You can find additional details relating to safety and security in our [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SaudiArabia.html) and Alerts and the website of the [U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia](https://sa.usembassy.gov/).

**Crime:** Crime in Saudi Arabia has increased over recent years but remains at levels far below most major metropolitan areas in the United States.

* You should be aware of your surroundings, keep valuables out of sight and secure, and travel with a companion, if possible.
* Some Saudi citizens who perceive that a foreigner is not observing conservative standards of conduct or dress have been known to harass, pursue, or assault that person.
* Even when released from detention, witnesses to criminal incidents may be prohibited from leaving the country until investigation of the incident is complete.

See the websites of the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime, you should contact the local police at “999” and contact the Embassy in Riyadh or one of the Consulates in Jeddah or Dhahran.Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

See the Department of State’s webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html).

The Department can:

* help you identify appropriate medical care;
* assist you in reporting a crime to the police;
* contact relatives or friends with your written consent;
* explain the local criminal justice process in general terms;
* provide a [list of local attorneys;](https://sa.usembassy.gov/services/?_ga=2.99515228.393403131.1709652246-767268408.1704903735#local)
* provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html);
* provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution;
* help you find accommodation and arrange flights home;
* replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:** If you are the victim of any form of physical violence, including domestic violence, you should contact the Saudi police by calling “999”.  In addition, victims of domestic violence can contact the Saudi National Domestic Violence Hotline by dialing “1919.” The Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development runs a network of shelters for women and children. Contacting the domestic violence hotline (“1919”) is the only way to access these shelters. The Saudi National Family Safety Program also runs a Child Help Line “116111” and can assist children in accessing Saudi social services.

When reporting domestic violence, it is imperative to get a case reference number as all Saudi social and legal assistance is tied to this case number. It is also a good idea to document any injuries and obtain a copy of any medical reports. U.S. citizens should be advised that filing a police report or utilizing any Saudi victims’ assistance services may result in the Saudi authorities informing your sponsor or guardian.

U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
