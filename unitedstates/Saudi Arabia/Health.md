**COVID-19 Testing**

COVID-19 testing is available to U.S. citizens throughout Saudi Arabia at public and private facilities. Private hospitals and clinics charge a fee for COVID-19 testing.  Cost, delivery method, and timing of results varies. Some facilities can electronically deliver results within 24 hours or less.

**COVID-19 Vaccines**

The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Saudi Arabia. For more information, please see the [Ministry of Health’s website.](https://www.moh.gov.sa/)

Visit the FDA's website to learn more about [FDA-approved vaccines](http://ilga.org/) in the United States.

Medical care varies greatly in quality, and high-profile cases of medical malpractice and errors have occurred. Consult your regular physician if you are considering serious medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.

**The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

Medical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Saudi Arabia accept cash or credit card payments.  See the Department’s webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). Supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation is strongly recommended. If you are covered by Saudi insurance, be sure to read the fine print: local insurance can have exclusions that are unusual in the United States. For example, some local policies may not supply coverage for accidents that occur while engaging in adventure sports, such as riding quad vehicles in the desert, that are a common past-time for expatriates.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Saudi Arabia](https://saudiembassy.net/bringing-prescription-drugs-kingdom-saudi-arabia) to ensure the medication is legal in Saudi Arabia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
