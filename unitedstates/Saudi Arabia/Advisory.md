***Updated to reflect current security conditions and other minor edits.***

Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to the **threat of missile and drone attacks from Yemen** and **terrorism.** Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Be aware of risks concerning **social media activity** and **importation of prohibited items**.

Do not travel to the following locations due to the threat of **missile and drone attacks** and **terrorism**:

* Within 20 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the city of Najran
* Qatif in the Eastern Province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.

**Country Summary:** U.S. Embassy and Consulate personnel must adhere to the above travel restrictions. The U.S. government has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in the above locations.

The Houthis have perpetrated **missile and drone attacks** in Saudi Arabia. Attacks have been rare since the announcement of a truce between Saudi Arabia, the Houthi rebels, and the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Recent Houthi attacks have focused on vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. The Houthis have also threatened to renew attacks against Saudi Arabia. Past attacks have been aimed at targets throughout the country. Cities, infrastructure, airports, military bases and energy facilities have all been targeted.

Debris from intercepted drones and missiles has also been a risk. U.S. citizens living and working near infrastructure and military bases and infrastructure are at increased risk if attacks reoccur. The risk is most pronounced near the border with Yemen.

**Terrorism** continues to be a concern in Saudi Arabia. Attacks can occur with little or no warning. Terrorists have targeted Saudi and international interests. Religious sites and other places frequented by U.S. citizens have been targeted. Globally, terrorists are using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles. Targets often include tourist locations, large gatherings, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, and government facilities. Terrorists are also known to time attacks around major holidays and/or in response to military operations.

**Social media activity** Saudi authorities deem critical, offensive, or disruptive to public order, could lead to **arrest**. U.S. citizens have been arrested for past social media activity and comments made while outside of Saudi Arabia. This may include posting, re-posting, or liking comments critical of Saudi institutions, policies, or public life. Saudi laws on cybercrime and terrorism are used to prosecute these cases. Punishment for social media activity has included prison sentences of up to 45 years. Saudi courts do not necessarily consider the timeframe of the posts, or the location from which they were made, to be material.

**It is illegal to bring drugs (including marijuana), drug paraphernalia, or alcohol into Saudi Arabia. Importing gambling-related items, weapons, or pork is prohibited. Bringing materials that could be considered obscene or suggestive into Saudi Arabia is also prohibited**. Penalties are severe by U.S. standards.
