# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Dual Citizenship:** Saudi Arabia generally does not recognize dual nationality. Saudi law requires Saudi citizens to obtain official permission from the government before obtaining a second nationality. At times, Saudi authorities have confiscated the passports of U.S. citizens applying for Saudi citizenship. This does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship. If this happens to you or someone you know, report the incident to the U.S. Embassy.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate immediately. Be aware that Saudi Arabia generally restricts consular notification of the arrest of foreigners to the Embassy of the country that issued the travel document used to enter the Kingdom. If you enter Saudi Arabia with a Saudi travel document, or with the passport of a country other than the United States, it will be extremely difficult for the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services if you are subsequently detained. Persons detained in Saudi Arabia may be held without charges for lengthy periods and denied access to counsel; dual citizens may not have consular assistance. See the [Embassy’s webpage](https://sa.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Drones:** The importation of drones for commercial or personal use is prohibited without prior approval from the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA). A customs clearance certificate authorizing importation can be obtained as part of the GACA approval process. Visit [GACA’s website](https://gaca.gov.sa/web/en-gb/news/gacanews-130119-hf01) for further information.

**Criminal Penalties:** While in Saudi Arabia, you are subject to local laws. If you violate Saudi laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled; arrested; imprisoned; held without trial for lengthy periods of time; interrogated without counsel; subject to corporal punishments, including lashings; or executed.

Penalties for the import, manufacture, possession, and consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs in Saudi Arabia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings, and deportation. The penalty for drug trafficking is death. Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the [Department of Justice website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html).

There are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and political expression in Saudi Arabia. For additional information see the Department of State’s [Human Rights Report for Saudi Arabia](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#wrapper).

**Faith-Related Travel Issues:** Islam is the official religion of the country and is present in all aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. See our [Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/Hajj.html).

* Saudi authorities do not permit criticism of Islam or Muslim religious figures, including on social media.
* The government prohibits the public practice of religions other than Islam. Non-Muslims suspected of violating these restrictions have been jailed and/or deported. Church services in private homes have been raided, and participants have been jailed and/or deported.
* Muslims who do not adhere to the strict interpretation of Islam prevalent in much of Saudi Arabia may encounter societal discrimination and constraints on public worship.
* Public display of non-Islamic religious articles, such as crosses and Bibles, is not permitted.
* Non-Muslims are forbidden to travel to Mecca and parts of Medina, the cities where two of Islam’s holiest mosques are located.
* See the Department of State’s [International Religious Freedom Report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/).

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations, even when consensual, are criminalized in Saudi Arabia. Violations of Saudi laws governing perceived expressions of, or support for, same-sex sexual relations, including on social media, may be subject to severe punishment. Potential penalties include fines, jail time, or death. See our [LGB Travel Information page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) and section 6 of the [Department of State's Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is generally found in the United States. Saudi law does not prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and there is no legislation requiring public accessibility. Newer commercial and government buildings, however, often include such access. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, there are numerous government-sponsored centers for people with disabilities. Note that Saudi Arabia has limited infrastructure to care for those with mental disabilities.

**Students:** See the Department’s [Students Abroad page](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Residents and Travelers:** Married women, including non-Saudis, require their husband's permission to depart the country, while unmarried women and children require the permission of their father or male guardian.

Minor children must have their father’s permission in order to leave the Kingdom. Children visiting their fathers in Saudi Arabia, even when there is a custody agreement, can be prevented from leaving unless the father consents. This is true even if the child is an American citizen. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their father/guardian's permission.

If a foreigner and a Saudi living in Saudi Arabia divorce, Saudi courts rarely grant permission for the foreign parent to leave the country with the children born during the marriage, even if he or she has been granted physical custody.

Foreign mothers of Saudi children, who are divorced or widowed, may apply for a permanent residency permit(iqama) without the need for a sponsor. To do so, they must prove maternity and that they were legally married to the Saudi father.

**Employment:** The Arabic text of a contract governs employment and business arrangements under Saudi law. Verbal assurances or side letters are not binding under Saudi law. In the event of any contract dispute, Saudi authorities refer to the written contract.

* Sponsors have wide latitude and responsibilities for employees and family members under their sponsorship, including obtaining residence permits for the employee and for any family members.
* All residents should be issued a Saudi residence permit (iqama) and are legally required to carry it at all times.
* The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in Saudi Arabia cannot sponsor private U.S. citizens for Saudi visas.
* Sponsors have been known to demand that residents working in Saudi Arabia surrender their passports while in the Kingdom. Such practices are illegal and should be reported to the [Ministry of Labor and Social Development](https://mep.gov.sa/en/Pages/hrsd-Ministry.aspx).
* Since the Saudi sponsor controls the issuance of exit permits, U.S. citizens may be prevented by the sponsor from leaving Saudi Arabia in the event of a labor or business dispute, which could take months or years to resolve.
* To change employers within the Kingdom, Saudi Arabia requires the written permission of the original sponsoring employer.
* The U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General cannot assist in labor or business disputes, nor can they provide translation or legal services.
* U.S. consular officers can provide lists of local attorneys to help U.S. citizens settle business disputes, but ultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes through the Saudi legal system, and payment for those services, lies with the parties involved. For additional information on Saudi labor law, please refer to the [Ministry of Labor and Social Development’s webpage](https://mep.gov.sa/en/Pages/hrsd-Ministry.aspx).

**Customs:**

* Saudi customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the importation of such banned items as alcohol, weapons, and any item that is held to be contrary to the tenets of Islam (such as pork, anything considered pornographic under strict Islamic principles, and religious materials).
* Imported and domestic audiovisual media and reading matter are censored.
* Christmas and other holiday decorations, fashion magazines, and "suggestive" videos may be confiscated and the owner subject to penalties and fines.
* Electronic devices may be subject to inspection upon entry or exit. Please see the Department’s [Customs Information page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/customs.html) as well as the [Saudi Customs webpage.](https://www.my.gov.sa/wps/portal/snp/servicesDirectory/!ut/p/z0/fY4xD4IwEEZ_Tec7DBhX4kDSBY1RsQs5y0WL5YC2GH--DM6OX_LeywcGGjBCb_eg5EYhv-6b2bb6sMuzErO6rnSOx3123hT6gpgXcGIBDeY_tFZcP8-mBGNHSfxJ0AzWpZZFIXmv8L5EJxwjSceSAk-BhZcQn25S6FYlyO9SCtSxQrvENA7ReqZAYhmmV3X9AnAKUMY!/)

**Importing Animals:** The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture must approve all pets imported into Saudi Arabia.

* Cats and dogs entering Saudi Arabia require a Veterinary Health Certificate and a dated letter from the veterinary practitioner addressed to his/her sponsor to obtain the necessary approval from the Ministry of Agriculture.
* Both documents must be authenticated by the [Department of Agriculture Veterinary Service Office](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/) and the [State Department's Authentications Office](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/office-of-authentications.html) and attested by the [Embassy of Saudi Arabia](http://www.saudiembassy.net/).
* The certificate must indicate that the animal was examined and is free from disease and confirm that rabies and other vaccines are current. Information on the name, breed, sex, color, and age of the animal must also be stated.
* Please see additional information on [taking a pet overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/pets.html).

**Teaching English in Saudi Arabia:** In recent years, increasing numbers of American language teachers have experienced contractual and other problems. Some teachers have complained about arbitrary dismissals, difficult living conditions, salary arrears, unwanted reassignments, restrictions on their movement, and inability to leave the country. Prospective teachers in Saudi Arabia should vet their potential employer and carefully review their employment offer as well as the detailed information found in the Embassy’s [Guide to Teaching English in Saudi Arabia](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/Teaching%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Guide_2016%20June%206_Virginia%20Cleared.pdf). Additionally, prospective teachers should also take care to make sure that they obtain the appropriate work visa prior to coming to Saudi Arabia. The Embassy cannot help you if you violate Saudi labor law.

**Standards of Conduct and Religious Police:** Norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative. Both the uniformed police and the religious police, referred to colloquially as the mutawwa or al-hay’a, are charged with enforcing these standards.

* Mutawwa are required to carry special identification and usually are accompanied by uniformed police.
* While a 2016 government decree withdrew the authority of the mutawwa to make arrests independently of regular police forces, visitors should be prudent in their interactions with mutawwa.
* An individual must, if requested, present his/her residence permit (iqama) or other identification to the mutawwa or the police.
* U.S. citizens who are involved in an incident with the mutawwa should report the incident to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran.

In most areas of Saudi Arabia, and particularly in Riyadh and the central part of the Kingdom, women wear a full-length covering known as an abaya. Most women in conservative areas also cover their hair with a hijab for modesty, and many also cover their faces with a niqab.

Tourists are expected to dress modestly in public, avoiding tight fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images; women are not required to wear abayas or cover their hair but are expected to cover their shoulders and knees, and men should not go without a shirt. Women who choose not to conform to Saudi Arabia’s dress code face a risk of confrontation by mutawwa, negative or hostile comments by Saudi citizens, and possible detention Guidelines on public decorum for tourists are available at the Saudi government’s official tourism website, www.visitsaudi.com. Many areas of life in Saudi Arabia are segregated by sex to ensure that unrelated men and women have no possibility of mingling (a punishable crime) by unmarried men and women. Less frequently, members of the mutawwa try to enforce this by asking for proof that a couple is married or related. Men and women detained for socializing with individuals who are not relatives may be charged with moral crimes such as khulwa (mixing with unrelated members of the opposite sex). Less frequently, some restaurants may refuse to serve women who are not accompanied by a close male relative In addition, a few restaurants or cafes do not have a "family section" in which women are permitted to eat. Men not accompanied by a close female family member are not allowed to enter family sections and cannot use services (such as registers at supermarkets) designated as “family.” These restrictions are not always clearly posted.

While there are now movie theaters, musical concerts, and artistic performances in Saudi Arabia, the country remains socially conservative. Social media postings which contravene cultural standards can have legal and/or criminal consequences.

**Photography:** The Saudi government does not permit photography of governmental facilities, such as military bases and government buildings, nor military, security, or police personnel. The Saudi government is also sensitive to photographs that may be perceived as portraying the country in an unfavorable light. This policy can include photos of mosques, impoverished areas, the local population, and traditional souks (markets). You should not take anyone’s picture without clear consent, and never take a picture of a woman or a place where women congregate. Be aware of local sensitivities whenever you are taking pictures in public. U.S. citizens have been routinely detained for violating these policies. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are unable to intervene if you violate Saudi law.

**The Hajj and Umrah:** Please review the Department of State’s [Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/Hajj.html) for useful information on traveling to perform the Hajj or Umrah.
