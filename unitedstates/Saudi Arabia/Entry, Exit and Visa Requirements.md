# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

See the [Embassy of Saudi Arabia’s website](https://www.saudiembassy.net/) for visa information.

**COVID-19 Requirements:** There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

For residency permit-holders (iqama), an exit/reentry permit is required to leave Saudi Arabia as well as six month’s validity on your passport to request an exit/reentry permit.

* Saudi law requires that residency permit-holders carry their residency card (iqama) at all times while in the Kingdom. Failure to do so could result in a fine of 3,000 Saudi riyals and a jail sentence of six weeks.
* Females and minors may require a male guardian’s permission to leave the country, including U.S. citizens or dual-nationals.
* You must exit Saudi Arabia using the passport for the nationality corresponding to the one on which you entered Saudi Arabia.

Saudi law requires all Saudi citizens to enter and depart the country with a Saudi travel document. If you enter the country on a Saudi laissez-passer (temporary travel document), you may encounter difficulty leaving the Kingdom.

Saudi embassies do not have the authority to adjudicate citizenship claims or issue passports, but they may issue a laissez-passer for presumed Saudi citizens for whom citizenship has not been adjudicated, such as children of a Saudi parent or parents who were married outside of Saudi Arabia. Once admitted to Saudi Arabia on a laissez-passer, the traveler must obtain a Saudi passport before leaving the country. Saudi nationality is not conferred quickly or easily, and the processing time for a Saudi passport in these cases has often been six months or years in some cases. Obtaining a U.S. passport will not help, as you will not be able to leave Saudi Arabia without an exit visa which will not be granted if you entered as a Saudi citizen.

The Department strongly recommends that U.S. citizens enter Saudi Arabia on a U.S. passport and Saudi visa, and not a laissez-passer.

**Length of Stay:** Bearers of tourist visas are generally admitted for a 90-day stay and may not remain in the Kingdom more than 180 days in a twelve month period. Carefully check your visa validity and length of stay granted, and clarify any questions on permitted length of stay with Saudi immigration officials on arrival. Dates are calculated in accordance with the Hijri calendar, which differs from the Gregorian calendar.

If you overstay your visa, you could face significant fines, detention, and/or deportation, and a ban from returning to Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. Embassy is unable to intercede, reduce fines, or prevent incarceration if you violate Saudi law.

**Travel Bans:** When placed under a travel ban, you cannot exit the country, even if you are a U.S. citizen or a dual U.S.-Saudi citizen. Travel bans are rigidly enforced and can take months or even years to resolve. Only Saudi Arabian authorities and sponsors can remove travel bans.

The government may issue travel bans on people who are/have:

* charged with criminal offenses;
* under investigation;
* involved in financial or labor disputes;
* failed to report to work according to the terms of the contract (absconded);
* unpaid debts or who have passed bad checks.

The list above is not exhaustive. Private Saudi citizens may also initiate travel bans against foreign citizens for various reasons.

**Residency Permits:** If you are seeking residency in Saudi Arabia, make sure you have all required legal documents authenticated before arriving. Neither the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh nor the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran can provide this service.

You should have all U.S. issued documents authenticated by the [Department of State Office of Authentications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/office-of-authentications.html) (202-485-8000) and attested by the [Embassy of Saudi Arabia](https://www.saudiembassy.net/) in Washington D.C.

Work Visas: If you plan on working in Saudi Arabia, you must obtain a work visa before you arrive. Foreigners working in Saudi Arabia are subject to the country’s sponsorship system, which concedes substantial legal authority over the worker to the employer. This can include the ability to prevent the employee from leaving the country. American citizens considering working in Saudi Arabia should carefully review the information about employment in the “Local Laws and Special Circumstances” section below.

If the visitor or business visa has been annotated “not permitted to work,” you are not allowed to legally work in Saudi Arabia. You risk substantial financial penalties, detention, deportation, and a ban from returning to Saudi Arabia if you work without legal permission. Additionally, without a work visa, there would be no legal grounds to pursue a case against an employer should a dispute arise.

**HIV/AIDS:**To obtain work and residence permits, you are required to obtain a medical report or physical examination confirming that you are free from contagious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. If you test positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, you will not be allowed to work in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has not imposed HIV/AIDS or hepatitis travel restrictions on other categories of travelers. Please inquire directly with the [Embassy of Saudi Arabia](https://www.saudiembassy.net/) before you travel.

**Vaccinations:**Visitors to Saudi Arabia should check vaccination requirements on the [Saudi Ministry of Health website.](https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Pages/Default.aspx)

**Yemen Travel:**The Department strongly advises U.S. citizens against travel to Yemen due to the ongoing conflict in that country. See our [Yemen Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html) for further information. A visa is required to enter Saudi Arabia, and Saudi authorities generally do not permit foreign citizens to enter Saudi Arabia using land border crossings from Yemen. The Embassy and Consulates General cannot provide assistance to U.S. citizens seeking to cross the Yemeni-Saudi border.
