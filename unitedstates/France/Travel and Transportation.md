# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads are generally comparable to those in the United States, but traffic engineering and driving habits pose special dangers.

Lane markings and sign placements may not be clear. Drivers should be prepared to make last-minute maneuvers.

Right-of-way rules differ from those in the United States. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, drivers entering intersections from the right have priority over those on the left, even when entering relatively large boulevards from small side streets.

Bicycles, motorcycles, scooters, and electric skateboards are prevalent on streets, crosswalks and sometimes sidewalks. They have legal priority and often do not respect traffic signals.

On major highways, there are service stations at least every 25 miles. Service stations are not as common on secondary roads in France as they are in the United States.

Highway toll stations may not accept U.S. credit cards. For non-residents, the simplest way to pay is with cash euros at the toll lane marked for that purpose. Do not attempt to use a credit card if it is the only one you have in your possession in case the machine does not return your card.

**Traffic Laws:** While French cities actively encourage bicycle rentals through widely available city-sponsored systems, you should be cautious, especially in a busy and unfamiliar urban environment. Helmets are neither required nor readily available near rental stations. If you plan to ride a bicycle in France, you should bring your own helmet. Though bicycles, scooters and electric skateboards must follow local traffic laws, or risk fines, they often do not do so and can pose a danger to drivers and pedestrians.  Many paths are clearly marked for this form of transportation in  larger cities.

Pedestrian accidents occur when a pedestrian steps out into the street, often when a car or motorcycle is making a turn through a pedestrian crosswalk. Pedestrians should be cautious and aware of traffic even when they have a green walking signal since this is no guarantee against aggressive drivers. Do not assume cars will stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk.

**Public Transportation:** Paris has an extensive and efficient public transportation system. The interconnecting system of buses, subways, and commuter rails is comparable to or better than that found in major U.S. cities. Similar transportation systems are found in all major French cities.

If you use any of France’s public transportation services, take particular care to retain your used or “validated” ticket until you exit the bus, subway, or train station completely, as it may be checked or required for exit. Children over four years of age must have a ticket.

Inspectors conduct intermittent, random checks and passengers who fail to present the correct validated ticket are subject to stiff and immediate fines.  Failing to sign and date or enclose photo (when required) on a tourist pass (Paris Visite) makes the pass invalid and the holder subject to a fine.

Inspectors may show no interest in explanations and no sympathy for an honest mistake. Failure to cooperate with inspectors may result in arrest.

Between cities, France has extensive rail service, which is safe and reliable. High-speed rail connects the major cities in France. Many cities are also served by frequent air service. Traveling by train is safer than driving.

See our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of the [French National Tourist Office](https://us.france.fr/en) for specific information on French driver's permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance. See Embassy of France’s [driving in France](https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?article376) webpage for information on using U.S. driver’s licenses in France.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of France’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of France’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to France should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/office-security/msci-portal/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal).
