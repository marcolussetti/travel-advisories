# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of France](https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?rubrique=2) website for the most current visa and entry requirement information.

The Government of France does not recognize the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. embassies and consulates overseas, as a valid travel document for visa-free entry into France. If traveling on this emergency passport, you may be refused boarding and/or entry by immigration officials and/or held at the airport until a return flight to the U.S. is available. Direct transit through France for another destination accepting an emergency passport may be permitted. You should check entry requirements of any other country of destination to make sure the emergency passport is accepted for entry.

You may enter the Schengen area, including France, for up to 90 days for tourist and business purposes without a visa.

Immigration officers may also request you show sufficient funds for your intended stay and a return airline ticket.

If you are traveling to France or Monaco for reasons other than business or tourism, such as employment (including diplomatic or official travel), study, or internship, you must obtain the appropriate French or Monegasque (Monaco) visa for that purpose before you leave the United States. You should be aware that it is nearly impossible to obtain or change visa status while in France.

All minors (under age 18) traveling without a parent or legal guardian and who are residents in France must have the written consent of at least one parent or legal guardian to leave France. The minor must travel with his or her own I.D., a copy of the parent/guardian’s I.D., and form number 15646\*01, executed by the parent/guardian and available [here](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.service-public.fr%2Fsimulateur%2Fcalcul%2F15646-01&data=04%7C01%7CEppingJN%40state.gov%7C25cb9a12683d4f2e5cbf08d8977c6094%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637425907745102966%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=QRY%2BogtJxhbHwejaoNHvsarcmt9hMFWzsmwQR7xylJ8%3D&reserved=0).
