# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

French authorities have spoken publicly about the heightened threat conditions for terrorist attacks in Europe.

A counterterrorism law enacted in 2017 allows the government to prevent the circulation of individuals and to create zones of protection and security.

The French government has temporarily reestablished border controls at its borders with its Schengen neighbors and movement may be restricted in some areas. Border controls with the United Kingdom, including the Channel Tunnel crossing, have also been reestablished following Brexit.

The Government of France routinely conducts security and crisis management drills involving deployment of security forces, emergency services, and police to high profile areas that may be near popular tourist sites. U.S. citizens should be aware of the possibility of drills and should heed instructions of local authorities should they encounter them.

French police and military routinely patrol public spaces. You should expect security inspections (to include purses, bags, and backpacks) at the entrance to large public venues and businesses.

When traveling or living in France, you should:

* Be aware of your local security situation and take appropriate steps to bolster your personal security.
* Monitor media and local information sources like [France24](http://www.france24.com/en/), [Radio France International](http://en.rfi.fr/france/), [The Local](https://www.thelocal.fr/), and the [Paris Travel Information webpage](https://en.parisinfo.com/) and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities.
* Address specific safety concerns to French law enforcement authorities who have responsibility for the safety and security of all residents and visitors to France.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.

**Crime:** The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing (passports, phones, cash, credit cards), vehicle and residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft.

Visitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Rental cars are frequently targeted for break-ins when visitors exit their vehicles and leave valuables behind.

Crimes of opportunity are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim resists.

Exercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with trusted companions.

While the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur.

Be aware of “date-rape” drugs, which are present in France. The Embassy has assisted multiple victims who appear to have been targeted using these drugs.

Be cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served, and do not leave your drink unattended or accept a drink from strangers, as they may have slipped drugs into the drink.

There are high incidences of “smash and grab” robberies in economically depressed areas or on highly traveled thoroughfares such as roads to and from the airport. Thieves on foot or motorcycle will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Strikes can interfere with travel plans and increase expenses of traveling to France.

Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants. In case of violence or property damage, French authorities may use chemical agents and water cannons to disperse crowds.

Alerts issued regarding demonstrations are posted on the [U.S. Mission’s website](https://fr.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 (the European emergency number which has some English-speaking staff)  or 17 from a landline or cell phone and contact the U.S. Embassy Paris at +(33)(1) 43-12-22-22. French authorities do not generally speak English and communication may be difficult.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
