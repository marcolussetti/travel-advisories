# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. French authorities will not routinely notify the Embassy unless you request them to do so. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Controlled Substances:** French law prohibits possession and trafficking of controlled substances and narcotics, including some substances that may be legal to possess under the law of certain U.S. states. More information on controlled substances is available [here](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F3161?lang=en). Individuals who violate France’s drug laws may face penalties including prison sentences.

Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

In France and Monaco, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol could result in your immediate arrest and detention.

**Flying Drones:** The use of drones and drone footage in France is highly regulated. It is against the law in France to operate drones over public spaces (including museums, parks, and streets); in urban areas and near airports, military bases, prisons, and nuclear plants; and at large gatherings such as outdoor concerts and parades. France has strict laws to protect an individual’s privacy, thus drone footage is heavily regulated. Violators can be arrested and subject to fines of up to 75,000 euros and/or one-year imprisonment.
