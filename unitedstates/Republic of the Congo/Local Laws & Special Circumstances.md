# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs may result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Dual nationality is legally recognized; if however, Congolese officials prosecute you as a Congolese citizen, we may be limited in our ability to assist. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Photography**: It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, key infrastructure such as ports, train stations, and airports, and along border areas. You could be detained or arrested, fined, and have equipment confiscated. Do not take photos of Congolese without their permission.

**Phone Service**: Cell phones are used extensively. SIM cards can be purchased locally to use with a compatible cell phone. Telecommunications systems outside of cities are unreliable or non-existent.

**Currency**: The Central African CFA franc (XAF) is the official currency. On a day-to-day basis, the Congo is a cash economy. Credit or debit cards are not widely accepted. ATMs dispense funds in local currency. You must declare CFA over 1 million upon arrival with a bank or cashier’s receipt or risk fines and CFA confiscation.

**Customs**: Arts and crafts, particularly wooden objects, are subject to an export tax. Ask to speak with the airport supervisor if customs agents solicit bribes when you seek to export these items.

**Artifacts**: It is prohibited to export items of historical significance such as wood pieces, sculptures, and paintings. Violators risk imprisonment and heavy fines. For a list of prohibited items, contact a Congolese embassy or consulate.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Republic of the Congo. LGB individuals, however, face societal discrimination and harassment. There have been reports of police in Pointe-Noire verbally, physically, or sexually abusing openly gay young men and harassing gay men to elicit bribes.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in the Republic of the Congo prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is generally not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be extremely limited in the main cities and nonexistent in the rest of the country.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers**: Women travelers may face additional risks and must stay vigilant of their surroundings. See more tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html) [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html). Sexual assault is a threat that is significantly under reported. Police reports for cases of sexual assault are free. However, the victim may be responsible for hospital fees charged for the associated medical examination. Domestic violence is widespread but likewise rarely reported.
