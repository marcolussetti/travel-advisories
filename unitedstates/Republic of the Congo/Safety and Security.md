# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Political violence and civil unrest may occur. In the past, political demonstrations have led to armed clashes, deaths, and injuries. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Official travel outside Brazzaville must be approved by the Embassy on a case-by-case basis. The Republic of Congo’s borders remain porous, particularly with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic; cross-border crime and armed activity may occur.

**National Parks and Wildlife Areas**: Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Armed poachers are present in some parks and forested border regions. Ensure you have the proper medical and medevac insurance for safari/adventure tours.

**Roadblocks**: Armed soldiers or national police may conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. These roadblocks often are poorly marked, and local authorities may target foreigners to solicit bribes.

**Crime**: While not common, violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and assault, remains a concern throughout the Republic of the Congo. Opportunistic crime, such as petty theft, pickpocketing, mugging, vehicle theft, and burglary, are frequently reported. Most crimes affecting expatriates in Brazzaville involve financially motivated opportunistic theft, robbery, and/or burglary, sometimes involving the use of bladed weapons. Risk of crime increases at night and in remote or isolated areas. Violent crime exists in outlying southern and northern neighborhoods of Brazzaville due to armed gang activity.

**Demonstrations** occur, though they have been on a small-scale in recent years. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Gatherings of armed gangs may occur in Brazzaville’s outlying neighborhoods; gang members have been known to perpetrate random acts of violence against passersby.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are not prevalent in Republic of the Congo. Those scams that do occur are typically initiated through Internet postings/profiles, dating apps, or by unsolicited emails and letters.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police (French) at +242 06 665-4804 and the U.S. Embassy at +242 06 612 2000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. There is a CFA 12,000 franc charge for most police reports (~$20). Legal action or recourse is extremely limited. Emergency services are limited in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and virtually non-existent elsewhere.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is extremely limited in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
