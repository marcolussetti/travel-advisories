# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Fatal accident rates are rising in areas with new highways, attributed to excessive speed, erratic driving habits, and lack of safety standards. Several highways have been completed, connecting the southern port city of Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville and to the northern town of Ouesso on the border with Cameroon and west to neighboring Gabon. However, most roads are in a poor state of repair or are dirt tracks and require an off-road vehicle; during the rainy season, September-December and February-May, they become impassable. Other hazards include pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchairs, and animals.

Be aware of increased risk of ambush and highway robbery when driving in rural or isolated areas.

Carry:

* spare tires
* food and water
* satellite phone
* maps and navigation equipment
* first aid kit
* protective clothing

Service stations and fuel are scarce in rural areas. Professional roadside assistance is not available.

**Traffic Laws**: A valid U.S. state or international driver’s license is required. Use of cell phones while driving is prohibited.

**Traffic stops**:

* Resist paying bribes. Politely ask for a ticket or for the officer’s name and badge number if no violation is alleged.
* Ask to contact the U.S. Embassy if you are not released.
* Report attempts to solicit bribes to the U.S. Embassy.

**Accidents**: Remain inside the vehicle and call for police. If a hostile mob forms, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station or gendarmerie to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered.

**Public Transportation:**

*Buses*

* Travel can be unsafe due to reckless driving, overcrowding, poor vehicle maintenance, and the potential for crime.

*Taxis*

* Hire only government authorized green and white taxis in Brazzaville and blue and white taxis in Pointe-Noire.
* Maintenance varies greatly; taxis do not undergo routine inspections and are generally not air conditioned.
* Negotiate fares before embarking since taxis are not metered. Most taxi drivers will round-up fares or not return change.

*Railroads*

* The line between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville is in service for freight only

*River Boats*

* Accidents may occur but travel is relatively safe.
* Expect delays since captains wait to fill seats before departing.
* Operating hours of Brazzaville port on the Congo River are 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. daily (stops 12 noon on Sunday) though ferry service between Brazzaville and Kinshasa may close with minimal notice.
* A visa is required to cross the Congo River between Brazzaville and Kinshasa (DRC) in both directions.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in the Republic of the Congo, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of the Republic of the Congo’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Republic of the Congo should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
