# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**State of Exception:**In December 2022, the Government of Honduras declared a “State of Exception.” There may be restrictions on freedom of movement and other rights under this State of Exception in 17 of the 18 Departments in Honduras. Monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions in specific cities and neighborhoods.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. It is important for all U.S. citizens in Honduras to be aware that Honduran legal procedures and traditions differ greatly from those to which most Americans are accustomed.

Judicial procedures are not always clear or easily understood by foreigners, and significant delays during the investigation and trial dates are common. U.S. citizens, as well as Hondurans, are often held in jail for months, and sometime years, while awaiting trial.  
  
Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Special circumstances:**

**Customs Regulations:** Strict regulations apply to the import and export of items such as vehicles, medications, and business equipment.  Honduran law prohibits the export of artifacts from pre-colonial civilizations, as well as certain birds and other flora and fauna.  For specific information, contact the Embassy of Honduras in Washington, DC and see our [Customs Regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html).

Individuals found to be in possession of illicit drugs, firearms, or more than $10,000 in currency are likely to be arrested and face prosecution by Honduran authorities. Fines for carrying more than $10,000 in undeclared currency can exceed one third of the total amount of currency carried by the traveler.

**Medication and Medical Equipment:** Medical brigades traveling to Honduras are advised that they need to complete customs forms, as well as medical clearance forms, at least three business days prior to brining medications or medical equipment into the country. U.S. citizens taking part in medical missions to Honduras should contact Aduanas Honduras ([www.aduanas.gob.hn](https://www.aduanas.gob.hn/)) and ARSA ([https://www.arsa.gob.hn/](https://arsa.gob.hn/)) for information regarding the timeline for customs approval, the forms that are required, and restrictions on the types of medications and equipment that are allowed.

**Firearms:** No one may bring firearms into Honduras, except for diplomats and other official travelers, or individuals participating in sporting events who have obtained a firearm permit from the Honduran Ministry of Security or Ministry of Defense prior to travel. Individuals who attempt to bring firearms into Honduras without an appropriate permit, will face prosecution for criminal possession and possibly trafficking of firearms.

**Marine Safety and Oversight:**  Honduran military personnel commonly board private vessels in Honduran territorial waters to verify crew and passenger documentation. Criminals have been known to pose as fisherman and commit armed assaults. If your vessel is hailed by a suspicious vessel, contact the U.S. Coast Guard by radio or INMARSAT at (305) 415-6800. U.S. citizens arriving to Honduras by sea, whether by private vessel or cruise ship, are subject to the same laws as other travelers.

**Watersports:** Strong undertows and currents make swimming at Honduras’s Pacific Coast beaches extremely dangerous even for experienced swimmers. Most beaches do not have lifeguards nor signage. If a lifeguard is present, follow their instructions. Honduras’s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.

**Investment:**  Many U.S. firms and citizens operating in Honduras have found corruption to be a serious problem. Due to poor regulation, financial investments pose high risks and have led to substantial losses.

Exercise extreme caution before investing in real estate. Fraudulent deeds are common and have led to numerous disputes. In addition, threats and violence have been used against U.S. citizens involved in property disputes. Numerous U.S. citizens have reported significant delays in resolving judicial cases and/or lack of cooperation from courts and the legal system.

**Adventure Sports:**  There is little to no oversight of safety standards in Honduras. You should research service providers to ensure they are using internationally acceptable or certified equipment, guides, safety measures, and instruction.

**LGB**

**Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Honduras. However, many activists report that crimes committed against the LGB community go unpunished. There have also been cases of police harassment of patrons in LGB nightclubs. LGB travelers should exercise caution, especially when expressing affection in public.

Seeour [LGB travel information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html) page and section 6 of the [Department of State's Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Honduran law requires access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, few buildings are accessible. Please review the information on the [State Department’s Traveling with Disabilities website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html).
