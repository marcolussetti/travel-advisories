# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Because of crime, poor road conditions, and heavy commercial truck traffic, driving in Honduras can be dangerous. The U.S. Embassy discourages car and bus travel after dark.

* Honduran roads are poorly lit and poorly marked.
* Traffic signs are often inadequate or non-existent.
* Drivers don’t always use headlights at night.
* People and animals wander onto the roads.
* Rockslides are common, especially in the rainy season (May through December) and can cause closure of major highways.

Dangerous stretches of road include:

* **The road between Tegucigalpa to Choluteca:** Be aware of mountain curves and potholes. Landslides and rockslides are more common in the rainy season.
* **The road from El Progreso to La Ceiba:** Bridges and roads may be in poor condition due to regular flooding. The road also has poor or no illumination, increasing risk at night.
* **CA-5 and CA-13 the highway between San Pedro Sula and Tela, particularly near the palm tree plantations near El Progreso:** Carjackings and robberies that target SUVs usually occur at night.
* **The road from Juticalpa to Telica, and from the turn off to Gualaco on Route 39 to San Esteban and Bonito Oriental:** Rival elements engage in violent acts against one another. Avoid this road and stay on the main Tegucigalpa-Juticalpa-Catacamas road while traveling in Olancho. This route has poor cellphone coverage which may increase the risk of an isolating event due to vehicle breakdowns or criminal encounters.

While Honduras and the United States have signed and ratified a Stolen Vehicle Treaty, existing Honduran laws protect good faith buyers (even of stolen vehicles), so the recovery and return of these vehicles to their original owners is not guaranteed. Vehicle insurance may mitigate loss; please check with the [National Insurance Crime Bureau](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Honduras.html#ExternalPopup) or with private insurance carriers about coverage details.

**Traffic Laws:** In an accident, contact the Honduran Transit Authority (“Transito”) by dialing 911.

* Honduran law requires all vehicles involved in an accident to remain in place until Transit Authority agents arrive.
* Notify your car insurance company as soon as possible, preferably right after the accident.
* Carry personal identification documents, including your driver’s license, copies of passports, and vehicle registration cards while driving.

**Public Transportation:**  Avoid public transportation in Honduras.

* If you must travel by bus, always travel during daylight hours and on first-class conveyances, not economy buses.
* Choose taxis or rideshares carefully. Use Radio-Taxi services (companies that operate by phone) or app-based rideshare programs rather than hailing a taxi on the street and note the driver’s name and license number. Hotels and resorts may be able to recommend trusted taxi or shuttle services. Instruct the driver not to pick up other passengers, agree on the fare before you enter the vehicle, and have small bills available for payment, as taxi drivers often do not make change.
* When possible, travel in groups.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Honduras, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Honduras’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Honduras.html#ExternalPopup).
