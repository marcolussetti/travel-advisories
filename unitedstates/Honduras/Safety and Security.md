# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** While crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country, municipalities along the north coast and central portions of the country have historically had the country’s highest crime rates.

**Gracias a Dios**

Gracias a Dios is a remote region where narcotics trafficking is commonplace, infrastructure is weak, government services are limited, and police or military presence is scarce. The U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Gracias a Dios. U.S. citizens should not travel to Gracias a Dios. The Honduran government conducts police and military patrols in major cities in an effort to reduce crime. However, the ability of Honduran law enforcement authorities to prevent, respond to, and investigate criminal incidents, and to prosecute criminals is limited.

**Bay Islands and Copan Ruins**

Areas frequented by tourists, such as the Bay Islands (including Roatan, Utila and Guanaja) and Copan Ruins, have a higher concentration of law enforcement resources; however, crime remains a concern in these areas, particularly relating to drugs, robbery, and illegal possession of firearms. Travelers should still exercise reasonable precautions.  Foreign residents of the Bay Islands who purchase properties have reported increased incidents of harassment, including being the victims of violent attacks, after becoming involved in disputes.

Review your personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings and local events; and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance, take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, and follow instructions of local authorities.

**Demonstrations:**  Demonstrations regularly occur in Honduras, particularly near the Presidential Palace, Congress, and the universities in Tegucigalpa. Protests and work stoppages have become common at *Ministerio Publico* officesthroughout the country, leading to interruptions in services. Additionally, some protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. In addition, there are often demonstrations on the CA-5, the main highway connecting Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. This highway is used to access or exit Palmerola International Airport – XPL, near Comayagua (54 miles north of Tegucigalpa). Palmerola is currently the main international airport for Tegucigalpa. Protests often result in the extended closure of major roads and highways in and between major cities, blocking the flow of goods, services and reducing access to daily household supplies. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Honduras should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.

**Victims of Crime:** If you are a victim of crime, call the national police by dialing 911. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Severe Weather:** Honduras is vulnerable to hurricanes, heavy rains, and flooding, especially between June and November. For up-to-date information, visit Honduras’ National Emergency Management Commission ([COPECO](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Honduras.html#ExternalPopup)) website for current alerts, as well as the [National Hurricane Center’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Honduras.html#ExternalPopup).

**Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) page for information on scams.

**Tourism:**U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.state.gov.mcas.ms%2Fcontent%2Ftravel%2Fen%2Finternational-travel%2Fbefore-you-go%2Fyour-health-abroad%2FInsurance_Coverage_Overseas.html%3Fcq_ck%3D1708701048867%26McasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=c0faf6210156a766d6d56a468090eadbf7ff14e9134b92c8bb1ab41cbd1c7567) The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.
