*Reconsider travel to Honduras due to **crime**. Read the entire Travel Advisory.*

Do not travel to:

* Gracias a Dios Department, most eastern department, due to **crime**.

**Country Summary**: Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, and kidnapping, remains common. Violent gang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, rape, narcotics, and human trafficking, is widespread. Local authorities may lack sufficient resources to respond effectively to serious crime incidents. Around resort areas in the Bay Islands, which include Roatan, Utila, and Guanaja, there is a concentration of resources, and these areas are better policed.

Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country and can be about a variety of political or economic issues. Protests, demonstrations, tire burnings, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent. They can shutdown roads and highways, often without prior notice or estimated reopening timelines.

In December 2022, the Government of Honduras declared a “State of Exception” in response to high levels of extortion and other crimes. The declaration remains in effect and has been modified to include more cities. It allows the police to suspend constitutional rights in 226 of the country’s 298 municipalities.

The Honduran Ministry of Health declared in June 2024 a national emergency in Honduras due to an increase in dengue cases. The Ministry of Health has carried out dengue prevention, control, and surveillance activities, along with the promotion of preventive measures through the media and educational campaigns. It also carried out clean-up operations and campaigns, including the use of chemical and biological agents for vector control.

Narcotics trafficking is widespread, and large portions of the department are particularly vulnerable to drug trafficking organizations.
