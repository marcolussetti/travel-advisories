**Special Requirements for Minors:**Under Honduran law, ***children under age 21*** who are traveling unaccompanied or with only one parent must have written, notarized permission to travel from the non-traveling parent(s).

* If notarizing a permission letter in Honduras, the letter should be notarized by a Honduran notary public.
