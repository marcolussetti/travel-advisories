Staff, facilities, and supplies in Honduras often do not meet U.S. medical standards. There are adequate facilities in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula for advanced surgical procedures in case of non-elective emergencies.

Honduras lacks the infrastructure to maintain water purity and food safety. Diarrheal illness is very common even in large cities and luxury accommodations. Only sealed commercial water containers (bottles) are considered safe to drink.

Air pollution can aggravate or lead to respiratory problems during the dry season due to widespread forest fires and agricultural burning. Dry season varies and can occur from February to May. The agricultural fires can cause the air quality to reach unhealthy and even hazardous levels based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. During this season airports can be affected as smoke can reduce visibility and there have been short-term airport closures.

**The State Department and the U.S. Embassy will not pay your medical bills:**  Be aware that [U.S. Medicare](https://healthcareofamerica.org/?campaign_source=NG_HE_GSHC&campaign_medium=search&s2=Medicare&s1=17480218944&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2qKmBhCfARIsAFy8buJBwBSvT6MZPPy_G_JMmhmZNz8IRc5hOn2VqgGYUXJKmr4kDkAC58kaAsA1EALw_wcB&utm_term=Medicare&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=17480218944&utm_source=NG_HE_GSHC)/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription medication:**  If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Embassy of Honduras in Washington, D.C](https://www.facebook.com/EmbHondurasUSA/). to ensure the medication is legal in Honduras. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Always ensure you have enough medicine to cover your travel time, and research its availability in Honduras, or whether there is a viable replacement.

**Medical Marijuana:**Marijuana, even for medicinal use and with a prescription, is illegal in Honduras. A traveler who is found to have any amount of marijuana in their possession (including vape cartridges, edibles, organic cannabis, etc.) will face criminal prosecution for possession or trafficking.

**The following diseases are prevalent in Honduras:**

* Chikungunya
* Dengue Fever
* Malaria
* Zika
* COVID-19

The Honduran Ministry of Health declared a national emergency in June 2024 due to an increase in dengue cases. The Ministry of Health has carried out dengue prevention, control, and surveillance activities, along with the promotion of preventive measures through the media and educational campaigns. It also carried out clean-up operations and campaigns, including the use of chemical and biological agents for vector control.

Please review the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm)(CDC) website for further information.

**Vaccinations:** Honduras requires proof of Yellow Fever immunization if traveling to or coming from another country endemic with Yellow Fever. Check with your airline for vaccine requirements and be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vaccines-diseases.html) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
