# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or detained. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**ArrestNotification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.

See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Property Disputes**: Land disputes are common in Iraq and are often difficult to resolve through the legal system. The U.S. Embassy cannot take sides in a legal dispute. Those involved in a court dispute risk having claims filed against them, arrest, and being jailed.

**Special Circumstances:** Iraq lacks many public services. Electricity often fails. Fire and rescue services are inadequate, and hotels may not have fire safety equipment. Landline telephone service is limited, while cellular service reliability varies by region. The banking and financial infrastructure is underdeveloped. Transactions are largely cash-based. Hotels usually require payment in foreign currency. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are rare.

Customs officers have broad authority to search you and your vehicle at Iraqi ports of entry. Officers may confiscate any goods deemed a threat to the peace, security, health, environment, or social order of Iraq. Antiquities, cultural goods, and undeclared items for export may be confiscated. You may be ordered to return such goods, at their expense, to the jurisdiction from which they came.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**LGB Travelers:** Discrimination based on sexual orientation and unconventional appearance is common. In April 2024, the Iraqi Council of Representatives passed an amendment to Iraq’s existing Anti-Prostitution Law which bans same-sex relations with fines ranging from 10 to 15 million IQD and jailtime for 10 to 15 years. The law punishes any persons or organizations that “promote homosexuality.”

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and [section 6 of our Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Iraq prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the law is not widely enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

See our [Travelers with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad page](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure) for U.S. students.

**Women Travelers:** Female U.S. citizens have been subject to threats, kidnappings, abuse, and extortion by family, including loss of custody of children and forced marriage. U.S. laws do not protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States. The Iraqi police and legal system may offer little protection.
