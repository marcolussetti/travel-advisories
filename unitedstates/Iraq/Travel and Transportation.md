# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Vehicular travel in Iraq can be extremely dangerous. There have been attacks on civilian vehicles and on Iraqi military and security convoys on roads and highways throughout Iraq, both in and outside metropolitan areas. Attacks can occur at any time, night or day, and have involved small arms fire and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) capable of destroying vehicles.

**Traffic Laws:** Drivers usually do not yield to pedestrians at crosswalks and ignore traffic lights (if available), traffic rules, and regulations. Jaywalking is common. Roads are congested. Some cars do not use lights at night and urban streetlights may not be functioning. Some motorists drive at excessive speeds, tailgate, and force other drivers to yield the right of way.

Iraq has many government checkpoints scattered throughout the country. New ones may be placed randomly, particularly after terrorist attacks. It can take a long time to navigate them in crowded traffic, and some may shut down altogether at certain hours. Drivers should have car registration and ID documents available and should be very patient and polite.

**Public Transportation:** Buses run irregularly and frequently change routes. City transit vehicles are often poorly maintained and can be involved in accidents. Long-distance buses are available but are often in poor condition and drive at unsafe speeds.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Iraq, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Iraq’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

Because of the risks to civil aviation in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) that prohibits U.S. operators and codeshare flights from operating in Iraqi airspace below 32,000 feet. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Iraq should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA Broadcast Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.
