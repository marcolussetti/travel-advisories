Basic, modern medical care and medicines are not widely available in Iraq and do not meet U.S. standards. A limited number of companies facilitate medical evacuations. Blood banks exist in Iraq, though the blood supply may not be sufficient in the event of an emergency and likely has not been tested under U.S. standards for infectious disease. There is limited mental health or psychiatric care in Iraq.

For ambulance services dial 122. Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas. They are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in the original packaging along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended by](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
