[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Basic, modern medical care and medicines are not widely available in Iraq and do not meet U.S. standards. A limited number of companies facilitate medical evacuations. Blood banks exist in Iraq, though the blood supply may not be sufficient in the event of an emergency and likely has not been tested under U.S. standards for infectious disease. Mental health and psychiatric care is limited in Iraq.

For emergency services in Iraq, dial 122.

Ambulance services are:

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.
* Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://iq.usembassy.gov/medical-information-for-american-citizens/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.

See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Iraq. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. Consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, teens, and older adults.
* People with heart disease and lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

**Water Quality & Food Safety**
