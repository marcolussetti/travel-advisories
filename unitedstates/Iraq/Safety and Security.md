# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria—also known as ISIS, ISIL or Da’esh—is a designated terrorist organization active in Syria and Iraq. ISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking. Additionally, Iran-aligned militia groups encourage and conduct attacks against the U.S. presence in Iraq.

Iraq’s northern borders are especially dangerous due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest. Avoid all areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with military strikes by neighboring countries.

Due to security and safety threats, U.S. government employees working in Iraq live and work under strict security restrictions, which limit their movements and interactions.

**Crime:** Carjacking is common, even during daylight hours, and particularly on the highways from Jordan and Kuwait to Baghdad. Kidnappings of foreign nationals, Iraqi citizens, and dual U.S.-Iraqi citizens can occur for ransom or political/religious reasons. Many hostages have been killed. The murder rate remains high due to terrorism, tribal and family disputes, and religious/sectarian tensions. Sexual assault and domestic violence are common. Petty theft is common in Iraq, including pickpocketing and theft of valuables from hotel rooms and private residences.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scam are prevalent in Iraq. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact U.S. Embassy Baghdad or U.S. Consulate General Erbil for assistance.

Report crimes, fires, and accidents to local authorities by dialing:

* 104 for police
* 115 for fire
* 112 for the national emergency hotline
* 139 for sexual assault or domestic violence

Contact the U.S. Embassy at +964-760-030-3000. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
