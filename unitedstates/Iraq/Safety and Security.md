# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists increasingly use less-sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds at venues such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems, including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights.

Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Da’esh, is a designated terrorist organization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking.

Iraq’s northern borders are especially dangerous due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest.  U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries’ militaries.

Due to security and safety threats, U.S. government personnel in Iraq live and work under strict security guidelines, which limit their movements and interactions.

**Crime:**  Carjacking is common, even during daylight hours, and particularly on the highways from Jordan and Kuwait to Baghdad.  Kidnappings of foreigners, Iraqi citizens, and dual U.S.-Iraqi citizens can occur for ransom or political/religious reasons.  Many hostages have been killed.  The murder rate remains high due to terrorism, tribal and family disputes, and religious/sectarian tensions.  Sexual assault and domestic violence are common.  Petty theft is common in Iraq, including pickpocketing and theft of valuables from hotel rooms and private residences.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Women Travelers:** Female U.S. citizens have been subject to threats, kidnappings, abuse, and extortion by their family, including loss of custody of children or forced marriage.  U.S. laws do not protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States.  The Iraqi police and legal system may offer little protection.  See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Victims of Crime:**  Report crimes, fires, and accidents to local authorities by dialing 104 (Police), 115 (Fire), 112 (National Emergency Hotline), or 139 (sexual assault and domestic violence).  Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.  They speak Arabic.  U.S. citizen victims may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at +964-760-030-3000.  We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence in Iraq are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.
