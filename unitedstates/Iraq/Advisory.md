Do not travel to Iraq due to **terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and the U.S. government’s limited capacity to provide assistance to U.S. citizens.**

**Country Summary:** U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks, including violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas, including major cities. Consular officers may not always able to assist U.S. citizens. The Department of State requires U.S. government personnel in Iraq to live and work under strict security due to serious threats

Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turn violent.

Do not travel near armed groups or Iraq’s northern borders due to:

* Continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups
* Armed conflict
* Aerial bombardment
* Civil unrest

U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of or supporting designated terrorist organizations is a crime under U.S. law. It can result in prison sentences and large fines in the United States. Read the [Syria Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html) for more information.

Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are prohibited from using Baghdad International Airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) prohibiting certain flight operations due to civil aviation risks within or in the vicinity of Iraq. For more information, consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq)
