# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Iraq has a strict entry and exit system.  Visa requirements vary depending on the traveler’s citizenship, Iraqi ancestry, purpose of travel, and duration of stay.  Visas on arrival are available for U.S. citizen tourists at airports in Iraq, including Erbil International Airport.  Travelers to Iraq should not depart Iraq without ensuring they receive an exit stamp in their passport.

Residency stamps and blood tests may be required for long-term residents and those who plan to seek employment.  Iraq imposes penalties, such as fines, detention, or deportation, for violations of Iraqi immigration policies, including overstays or working without authorization.

The possession of weapons and movements through checkpoints are strictly regulated.  U.S. citizens traveling to Iraq without authorization to possess weapons, or those who travel through checkpoints without proper documents or a clear purpose of travel, may be detained by authorities.

All travelers should visit the Embassy of Iraq’s website at  [https://www.iraqiembassy.us/page/visas-to-iraq/](https://www.iraqiembassy.us/) for visa and other relevant travel information.
