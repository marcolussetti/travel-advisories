**Road Conditions and Safety**: Road conditions in Croatia may differ significantly from those in the United States. Current information about traffic and road conditions is available in English from the [Croatian Automobile Association](https://www.hak.hr/en#traffic-flow-and-road-conditions)(HAK) or by calling +385 1 464-0800 (English-speaking operators available 24 hours) or +385 1 661-1999.

* Exercise caution when driving in Croatia. On the highways, be aware of aggressive drivers passing on curves or in oncoming lanes.
* Highway tolls are higher than in the United States and can be paid in cash or by credit card.
* [Croatian radio](https://streema.com/radios/country/Croatia) broadcasts programs in foreign languages on several frequencies. From mid-June to mid-September, Channel 2 broadcasts foreign news, traffic information, and important information in English, German and Italian.
* Within Croatia, emergency roadside assistance is available by calling 1987 or, if calling internationally, +385 1 1987. Dial 112 or 192 to speak to the police and dial 194 for an ambulance. Dial 112 for emergency services and they will automatically forward your call to either the police, ambulance, fire department, the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service or all of the above.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the right side of the road and overtake on the left. Speed limits range from 110 to 130 km/h (68 to 80 mph) on highways and motorways and 50 to 90 km/h (30 to 55 mph) on urban thoroughfares.

* **A Croatian driver's license is required for drivers who stay longer than twelve months.**
* **Don’t drink and drive**. The maximum legal blood-alcohol limit for drivers is 0.05 percent (0.00 percent for drivers with less than two years’ experience, drivers under 24 years of age, and truck or bus drivers).
* **Police routinely spot-check for drunk driving** and administer breath-analyzer tests at the scene of all accidents. Refusal to take a breath test is considered a de facto admission of driving while intoxicated. Penalties may include fines up to 2,500 euros and/or prison sentences.
* **For traffic accidents involving a foreign-registered vehicle,** the responding police officer must issue a vehicle damage certificate to the owner of the foreign-registered vehicle; this is necessary to cross the border out of Croatia. Upon written request, the police station in the area where the accident occurred will issue a traffic accident investigation record.
* **Seat belts for drivers and passengers are mandatory**. Infants must travel in child-safety seats. Children shorter than 150cm in height and younger than 3 years may not ride in the front seat.
* **No right on red at traffic lights unless allowed** by an additional green arrow.
* **Pedestrians have the right of way when crossing in designated, white-striped crosswalks.** You must stop.

**Headlights must be used all winter** (from the start of November until the end of March), as well as during fog and other inclement weather.

* It is illegal to talk on a cell phone while driving unless using a hands-free device.
* For specific information concerning Croatian driver's permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, please contact the [Croatian National Tourist Board](http://croatia.hr/en-GB).

**Public Transportation**: Pay attention to trams (streetcars) in Zagreb, which travel at high speeds through the narrow streets.
