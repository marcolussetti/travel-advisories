# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets and are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary IEDs and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Land Mines:** Armed conflict ended in all parts of Croatia in 1995; however, de-mining of areas along former confrontation lines continues. Known mined areas are well marked with Croatian-language warning signs using the international symbol for mines: a skull and crossbones inside a red, upside-down triangle. Drivers in former conflict areas should stay on paved roads to reduce the risk of encountering unmarked mines and unexploded ordnance.

* For more information about mine-affected areas in Croatia, please visit the [Croatian Mine Action Center's website](https://www.ctro.hr/en/)

**Crime:** Violent crime is rare but isolated attacks targeting specific persons or property can occur and may be racially motivated or prompted by lingering ethnic tensions from Croatia's war for independence.

* **Safeguard your belongings**, especially when using public transport. Report incidents of theft to the local police. File a police report if your passport is stolen.
* **Don’t display outward signs of wealth**. It may make you a target for thieves.
* **Avoid "gentlemen's clubs."** In the past, such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bills and threatened those who refuse to pay.

U.S. business entities are encouraged to read the most recent [Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Annual Crime and Safety Report for Croatia](https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=18941).

**Demonstrations**: While civil disorder is rare, U.S. citizens should monitor local media coverage, review their personal security practices, and be always aware of their surroundings. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent with little or no notice. Security messages about demonstrations can be found [here](https://hr.usembassy.gov/category/alert/) on the U.S. Embassy in Croatia’s website. Some soccer matches result in violent clashes of fans from rival teams. These clashes often cause disruptions in traffic in the affected area. High profile matches are often accompanied by heavy police presence.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime**: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may contact the [U.S. Embassy](https://hr.usembassy.gov/contact/) at +385 (1) 661-2200 and check the information on local resources for [victims of sexual assault](https://hr.usembassy.gov/victims-of-crime/) on the U.S. Embassy in Croatia’s website.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry in Croatia is regulated and rules generally enforced regarding safety inspections. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to reach a patient and provide assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
