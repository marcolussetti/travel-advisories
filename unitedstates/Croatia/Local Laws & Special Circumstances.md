# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/actioncenter/report-crime) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Recreational Drugs**: Some recreational drugs may be illegal in Croatia. The Government of Croatia maintains a [List of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Plants Which Can Be Used for Preparation of Narcotic Drugs](https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2016_01_10_258.html), which lists illegal substances.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Real estate**: U.S. citizens should exercise due diligence when considering purchasing real estate in Croatia. Consult with an attorney before undertaking a real estate purchase and be careful to fully understand the implications of all parts of a real estate contract. Working with a translator can help ensure your rights are protected. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist U.S. citizens with legal disputes. Be prepared to take your case to the local courts. Please review the U.S. Embassy’s website for [additional information on buying real estate in Croatia](https://hr.usembassy.gov/buying-real-estate/?_ga=2.101361601.194321556.1701955522-176209058.1701955522).

**Travelers checks, or personal checks are no longer accepted in Croatia**. ATMs are common, and credit cards are generally accepted. Facilities are available for wiring or transferring money.

**Recreational Boating:** The Croatian government requires all recreational captains chartering Croatian-flagged vessels to have a certificate of competence.

* Croatia recognizes certain certificates issued by the U.S. Sailing Association and licenses issued by the national authorities of other countries.
* Details on [classes of licenses recognized by country](https://mmpi.gov.hr/sea/recognition-of-stcw-certificates/18571) can be found on the [Ministry of the Sea, Transport, and Infrastructure](https://mmpi.gov.hr/en)’s webpage.
* Tourists in Croatia can be certified by passing a test at harbormasters' offices in Pula, Rijeka, Senj, Zadar, Sibenik, Split, Ploce, Dubrovnik, or at the Ministry in Zagreb.
* Travelers arriving by private marine craft should refer to the [Ministry’s website](https://mmpi.gov.hr/sea/6986)for information on nautical regulations.

**Climbing and Hiking:** If you intend to hike or climb in the mountains, seek local guides’ expert advice. For emergencies, call 112. Rock climbers in Paklenica National Park should consult a local guide or contact [Paklenica National Park](https://www.np-paklenica.hr/en/) prior to their visit.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions regarding same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Croatia. Although LGB individuals are afforded full rights in Croatia, same-sex couples may face legal challenges in the areas of adoption and next-of-kin determinations. In 2014, Croatia enacted the Law on Life Partnership of Same Sex Couples allowing for formal registration of same sex unions. The LGB community is protected by anti-discrimination laws, and there are no legal or governmental impediments to the organization of LGB events. However, there have been incidents against LGB groups, notably during annual pride events, both in Zagreb and Split. Individual cases of attacks on members of the LGB community have also been reported.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further information.

**Travelers With Disabilities or Who May Require Accessibility**. Accessibility and accommodation in Croatia are different from those in the United States. Croatian law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. It also mandates access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities; however, there is a marked difference in new construction compared to old construction, where access can still be limited. Croatia’s geography is hilly and often steep, particularly along the coast, and it presents challenges to some persons with disabilities. Access to public transportation may not always be available. Outside urban areas, accessibility worsens significantly.

Many cities in Croatia are making access improvement for travelers with disabilities.
