Adequate medical care is readily available in Croatia, but facilities may not be comparable to U.S. standards. Travelers to Croatia may obtain [a list of English-speaking physicians](https://hr.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) on the U.S. Embassy’s website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. You may need a prescription to get some medications that you can purchase over the counter in the United States.

**For emergency services in Croatia, dial 194 or 112.**

**Ambulance services** are:

* not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available in major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics may lack advanced resources and specialized medical supplies.
* Credit card payment is not always available. Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Private hospitals may require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Public hospitals are minimally staffed overnight in non-emergency wards.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.
* There are shortages of medical staff (nurses, doctors) throughout the country that may delay exams, imaging, surgeries, etc. at public healthcare centers. Occasionally shortages of special medications may occur.

**We do not pay medical bills.** U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Croatia accept cash or credit card payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Prescription medication: If traveling with prescription medication, please check with the government of Croatia and its [Customs Administration](https://carina.gov.hr/featured/information-for-passengers-natural-persons/bringing-in-medicine-and-narcotics/6745) to make sure the medication is legal in Croatia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Visit the U.S. Embassy’s website for information on [bringing medical drugs for personal use when traveling to Croatia](https://hr.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). Note that Croatian law prohibits the importation of drugs via postal mail.
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) websites for more information.

**Vaccinations**: Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/croatia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* If you will be in Croatia for more than three months, especially if you anticipate hiking, camping, or other outdoor activities in forested areas, you may wish to get a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine. [According to the CDC, the TBE](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/tickborne-encephalitis) vaccine is now available in the United States, but is carried only in larger travel clinics.

If you are in Croatia, it is available from local doctors. Use insect repellent and inspect your body for ticks after spending time outdoors.

**Diseases**

* [Influenza](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/) is prevalent during the winter season.
* HIV/AIDS: There is a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Croatia. HIV/AIDS treatment and medication are available in Croatia.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) regarding specific issues in Croatia.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Croatia.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Croatia.
* Although Croatia has several elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Croatia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and that professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Adventure Travel**

Visit [Adventure Travel](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) and [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information.

**Air Quality**

Cities in Croatia have air pollution levels slightly higher than those in major U.S. cities, with higher levels measured in winter. Visit [the European Environment Agency’s website](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/explore-interactive-maps/up-to-date-air-quality-data) for information on air quality in Croatia.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Croatia.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Water Quality**

* Croatia has an abundance of fresh water and the public drinking water systems cover around 87% of the population. Water quality is tested daily throughout the country. Tests are performed according to internationally accepted standards. Water in Croatia is of high quality with potable tap water being available in most places. Some rural areas rely on private wells that may not be subject to quality testing standards. Some older buildings in major cities may have led-laced piping leading to increased levels of lead in the drinking water. You can learn more by visiting the [Croatian Institute of Public Health website](https://www.hzjz.hr/en/division-of-environmental-health/drinking-water-safety-in-croatia/).
