For emergency services in Laos, dial 1191 (police) or 1195 (ambulance).

**Medical facilities and services in Laos are extremely limited and may not meet basic international standards.**

Contact information for hospitals/clinics is found [here](https://la.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers accept only cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867).

**We strongly recommend**[**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html)**to cover medical evacuation.** Every year the Embassy sees cases of U.S. citizens who fall ill in Laos and are unable to get necessary health care because they don’t have adequate insurance. Serious medical cases frequently require medical evacuation to private hospitals in Thailand by ground ambulance or air ambulance. Hospitals in Thailand and Laos require large deposits prior to treating patients. The State Department does not pay medical bills.

**Border Crossing Hours**

All of the land border crossings between Laos and neighboring countries close during the night hours.The Friendship Bridge that connects Vientiane to Nong Khai, Thailand, closes from 10 p.m. – 6 a.m. daily.**While it is generally possible for ambulances to cross the Vientiane Friendship Bridge after hours, it sometimes takes several hours to arrange for the crossing to be opened, even in cases of severe medical emergencies.**Travelers should inquire locally about the hours of other border crossings**.**

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mofa.gov.la/) to ensure the medication is legal in Laos.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Laos.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
