# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fcriminal-ceos&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C993898a52ab44b1f002208db8e7dc205%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638260443001702384%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Cu86S5kbD2eIgCXcUy3aiBjIKHTVNTbpyNL2FymXsoc%3D&reserved=0 "https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos") website.

**Arrest Notification:**Laos does not routinely inform the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of U.S. citizens in a timely fashion and does not always allow consular access to arrested individuals. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information

**Police and legal system bribes and informal procedures:** It is common for police to target foreigners to pay bribes for alleged traffic offenses. The Embassy is not usually able to provide assistance in these cases. Foreigners arrested for unruly conduct or damaging private property will often be held in police custody without formal charges being brought against them until they pay an indemnity to the injured party. This process usually takes a minimum of two to three weeks.

**Relationships with Lao citizens:**Lao law prohibits cohabitation or sexual contact between foreign citizens and Lao nationals except when the two parties have been married in accordance with Lao Family Law. Any foreigner who cohabitates with or enters into a sexual relationship with a Lao national risks being interrogated, detained, arrested, or fined. Foreigners are not permitted to invite Lao nationals of the opposite sex to their hotel rooms, and police may raid hotel rooms without notice or consent. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens of Lao descent, are not allowed to stay in the homes of Lao nationals, even family, without the prior consent of the village chief and local police.

**Foreigners who married a Lao national outside of Laos should have their marriage certificate authenticated at a Lao Embassy in the country where the marriage took place before traveling to Laos.**

**Possession of, trafficking in, and manufacture of drugs are serious offenses in Laos** and result in lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty. Some restaurants offer “happy” or “special” menu items -- particularly “pizzas” or “shakes” -- that may contain opiates or unknown substances. Consuming these items is illegal.

**Adventure Tourism:**Laos has a developing adventure tourism industry that includes, but is not limited to, zip-lining, bungee jumping, rock climbing, and off-road bikes and buggies. Safety standards and training requirements for personnel operating these activities and safety inspections of the equipment may not be equivalent to those required for similar activities in the United States. We recommend that travelers check the safety records of adventure tourism operators. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [adventure travel](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html).

**Water Safety:**Travel by speedboat on rivers in Laos is dangerous, especially when water levels are low. White water rafting, kayaking, tubing, and other water-based activities, including swimming in the Mekong, are dangerous. Foreigners have drowned or been seriously injured. Do not participate in any water-based activities while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Please be aware that safety advice will be minimal, and there may not be warning signs at tourist sites.

**Hotel Safety:**Some hotels in Laos do not meet U.S. safety standards for security and fire safety.
