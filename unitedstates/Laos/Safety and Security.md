**The Embassy recommends U.S. citizens reconsider travel to all of Xaisomboun** **Province**. U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to Xaisomboun Province due to past incidents of violence.

**There are large amounts of unexploded ordnance (UXO)** **in Laos**left over from the Indochina War. UXO is found in some parts of Savannakhet, Xieng Khouang, Salavan, Khammouane, Sekong, Champassak, Houaphan, Attapeu, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane provinces. In particular, UXO is found along Route 7 (from Route 13 to the Vietnam border), Route 9 (Savannakhet to the Vietnam border), and Route 20 (Pakse to Salavan). Never pick up unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths.

**Exercise caution in remote areas along the border with Burma.**Bandits, drug traffickers, and other people pursuing illegal activities operate in these border areas.

**Crime:**

* **Petty thieves target foreigners**for pickpocketing (especially in tourist hubs) and theft of unattended property, including in vehicles. Thieves on passing motorcycles snatch purses. Petty theft increases during major Lao holidays. Residential break-ins also occur.
* **Scams:**In tourist areas, shop owners may rent motorbikes to tourists, have someone “steal” the motorbike, and charge the tourist for the cost of the “stolen” motorbike. Be cautious of rental arrangements and never provide your passport as collateral.
* See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information on scams.
