# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* **Road accidents are a major cause of death.** Defensive driving is imperative; many drivers pay little attention to traffic laws.
* **Poor driving conditions:**Traffic is chaotic, and road conditions can be rough. Few roads have lane markings, road signs, and stoplights. Drivers widely ignore those that exist. Speeding, reckless passing, and failure to obey traffic laws are common. Many drivers are underage, unlicensed, inexperienced, or uninsured. Driving under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs is common. Motorcycles carry as many as five people, greatly impeding the drivers' ability to react to traffic. Road conditions worsen during the rainy season and landslides are common, including on major routes connecting provincial capitals.
* **Avoid driving at night**. Road construction sites are poorly marked, appear with no warning, and can be difficult to see at night. Roads are poorly illuminated, many vehicles have no operating lights, few bicycles have reflectors, and trucks without reflectors commonly park on unlighted roads.
* **Motorcycles and motorbikes:**The U.S. Embassy prohibits Embassy personnel in Laos from using motorcycles, motorbikes, and scooters due to a high incidence of accidents and lack of available medical care. You should also consider not using these vehicles.
* **Emergency vehicles:**There are no government ambulance services, and a scarcity of private ambulances makes it difficult for accident victims to receive timely medical attention.
* **Intoxicated drivers:**Drunk driving is rampant, especially in the evening.

**Traffic Laws:**

* **Traffic accidents:**A driver involved in a traffic accident should remain at the scene and attempt to contact the police or wait for the police to arrive to prepare an accident report. If renting a car or motorcycle, contact the rental company and its insurance agent.
* Traffic moves on the right, but vehicles use all parts of the road.

**Public Transportation:**

* **Public transportation** is scarce and the transportation available is very limited after sunset. There are a limited number of buses and shared van/covered pick-up truck services.
* **Inter-city transport**is provided by buses, vans, pickups, and trucks, any of which may be in poor repair.
* **For-hire vehicles:**Taxis or cars-for-hire are available only at major transit hubs such as border crossings and airports. “Tuk-tuks” -- three-wheeled, open-sided vehicles -- are available in tourist areas, but are frequently in poor repair, and drivers generally speak little to no English. Car taxis are also available by phone.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Laos, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Lao civil aviation authority [DLP1] for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Laos’ air carrier operations.
