# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Avoid driving in Venezuela. If you do drive, drive defensively, as most drivers do not obey rules.
* Do not drive at night outside major cities. Police and national guard checkpoints are mandatory, and criminals often set up fake checkpoints during nighttime to rob or kidnap victims.
* Road damage is not clearly marked.
* Traffic jams are common within Caracas during most of the day and are frequently exploited by criminals. Armed motorcycle gangs operate in traffic jams. Comply with demands as victims may be killed for not complying.
* Do not use buses due to high levels of criminal activity.
* Venezuela experiences shortages in gasoline, and you should plan accordingly, especially when travelling to distant or rural areas. Be aware that the quality of gasoline is not the same as in the United States and may cause vehicle damage, requiring repairs and/or frequent maintenance.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Child car seats and seatbelts are not required and are seldom available in rental cars and taxis.
* Some Caracas municipalities have outlawed the use of handheld cell phones while driving.
* Stops at National Guard and local police checkpoints are mandatory. Follow all National Guard instructions and be prepared to show vehicle and insurance papers and passports. Vehicles may be searched.

**Public Transportation:**Subways, buses, trains, and other means of public transport in Venezuela do not have the same safety standards as in the United States.

 See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed that Venezuela’s Civil Aviation Authority is not in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Venezuela’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

The U.S. Department of Transportation issued an [order](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) suspending all nonstop flights between the United States and Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security concluded that conditions in Venezuela threaten the safety and security of passengers, aircraft, and crew traveling to or from that country.

Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Venezuela, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions). Emergency medical evacuation flights between the United States and Venezuela may not be possible.

**Maritime Travel:**

Mariners should not travel to Venezuela. If transiting near Venezuelan maritime boundaries, check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and [the NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/).

We reiterate that the U.S. Department of State urges citizens not to travel to Venezuela or to attempt to enter Venezuela without a visa.

Incidents of piracy off the coast of Venezuela remain a concern. Yachters should note that anchoring offshore is not considered safe. Marinas, including those in Puerto la Cruz and Margarita Island (Porlamar), provide only minimal security, and you should exercise a heightened level of caution in Venezuelan waters.
