# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Terrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Terrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC-EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN) have expanded in Venezuela in recent years. We are aware of reports of cooperation between FARC dissidents and the ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, forced displacement of communities, and narcotics trafficking.

**Crime:** Violent crime is pervasive throughout Venezuela. Venezuela has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and kidnappings are a serious concern.

If you are in Venezuela:

* Be alert of your surroundings at all times and take personal security precautions to avoid becoming a victim of crime.
* Maintain a low profile.
* Travel in groups of five or more, and
* Provide family or friends with your itineraries prior to departure.
* Avoid police activity. Corruption within the police forces is a concern, and criminals may be posing as police officers or National Guard members. National Guard members may target U.S. citizens, especially at remote land border crossings, for bribery, extortion, or detention, possibly in collusion with criminal organizations.

Criminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints. Armed robberies, including with grenades and assault rifles, take place throughout the country, including in tourist areas and institutions such as banks and ATMs, national parks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities.

**Drugs:** Do not attempt to bring any narcotics or controlled substances into Venezuela, or substances that may be confused with illegal drugs.

* Do not accept packages from anyone.
* Always keep your luggage with you.
* U.S. citizens have been actively recruited as narcotics couriers or “drug mules.” Arrestees can expect extended jail terms under extremely difficult prison conditions.

**Transportation:**

* Do not use any taxis hailed on the street. Use only radio-dispatched taxis from taxi services, hotels, restaurants, and airline staff. Some taxi drivers in Caracas are known to overcharge, rob, injure, and even kidnap passengers.
* Do not use public transportation such as city buses and the metro (subway) in Caracas.
* If you drive, be aware of attacks in tunnels and avoid obstacles in the road.

**Maiquetía International Airport:** Only travel to and from Maiquetía International Airport near Caracas in daylight hours. Kidnappings, robberies at gunpoint, thefts, and muggings are common. Individuals wearing seemingly official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials have been involved in crimes inside the airport, including extortion and robberies.

* Do not pack valuable items or documents in checked luggage.
* Make advance plans for transportation from the airport to your hotel or destination using a trusted party or dispatch taxi service.

**ATMs:**  Most ATMs do not accept U.S. debit or credit cards, and malfunctions are common. Many ATMs do not have cash. Criminals target ATM users for robberies. ATM data is often hacked and used to make unauthorized withdrawals.

* Use only ATMs located in well-lit, public places.

**Demonstrations** occur occasionally.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**  See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for additional information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Venezuela.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Grandparent/relative targeting

**Victims of Crime:** The [U.S. Embassy in Caracas](https://ve.usembassy.gov/) suspended operations on March 11, 2019, and therefore cannot provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. The U.S. Embassy in Colombia assists U.S. citizens in Venezuela when possible.

* U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
* Report crimes to the local police and contact the [U.S. Embassy in Bogota](https://co.usembassy.gov/contact/) by completing our online form at <https://co.usembassy.gov/services/contact-acs-form/> or dialing +57 (1) 275-2000 or +57 (1) 275-4021 after hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Note that emergency numbers may not function in Venezuela and travelers should be prepared to make direct contact with the nearest police station to reach emergency service personnel.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crimes overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the [U.S. Embassy in Bogota](https://co.usembassy.gov/services/) for assistance.

**Colombian Border:** The area within 50-miles of the entire Venezuela and Colombian border is extremely dangerous. U.S. citizens near the border are at risk of detention by authorities. U.S. citizens must obtain a visa to enter Venezuela legally. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. Maduro authorities do not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. Additionally, cross-border violence, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and smuggling are common. Some kidnapping victims are released after ransom payments, while others are murdered.

* Do not attempt to cross the land border.

**Tourism:** Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment does not meet U.S. standards. Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela. Air evacuations to the United States from Venezuela may not be possible.

* U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).
