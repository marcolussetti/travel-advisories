# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The U.S. Department of State strongly urges U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela. Detentions of U.S. citizens at formal or informal border crossings into Venezuela are common.

To enter Venezuela, you must have:

* A valid U.S. passport in good condition with at least six months of validity, and
* A valid Venezuelan visa. Visas are not available upon arrival.

**Visas:** The Venezuelan embassy and consulates in the United States are not open. For information about visa services, contact the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico at +52 55 5203 4233. You must have the proper visa and appropriate accreditation before traveling to Venezuela. If not, you face refusal of admission, expulsion, or detention.

Immigration officials often require proof of accommodation while in Venezuela, adequate means of support, and an onward departure itinerary. Use only official crossing points when entering Venezuela. You must obtain an entry stamp upon entry.

If you reside in Venezuela as a non-citizen, you must obtain legitimate Venezuelan residency documentation and renew your residency visa well in advance of expiration. Do not use intermediaries to purchase resident visas and/or work permits.

**Traveling with Children:** Venezuela’s child protection law mandates that minors (under 18) of any nationality who are traveling alone, with only one parent, or with a third party, must present extensive, specific, and notarized documentation granting permission for travel. Consult the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate for further information.

**Dual Nationality:**  Venezuelan law requires Venezuelan citizens to enter and depart Venezuela using Venezuelan passports. If you hold dual U.S. and Venezuelan nationality, you must plan to travel between the United States and Venezuela with valid U.S. and Venezuelan passports. Dual-national minors are only allowed to depart Venezuela with both parents present or with a legal authorization signed by the absent parent in a family court.

**Immunizations:** Visit the [CDC Traveler website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/venezuela) for vaccination information, including Yellow Fever vaccination requirements. Carry your International Certificate of Vaccination (or yellow card) with you upon arrival or departure. Travel to Venezuela no longer requires evidence of COVID-19 vaccination.

**HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Venezuela. Be aware that HIV/AIDS medications, like other medications, are often not available in Venezuela.
