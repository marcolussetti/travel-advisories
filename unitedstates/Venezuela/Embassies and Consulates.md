The U.S. Department of State urges U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela, and recommends that U.S. citizens in Venezuela leave immediately. More information is in our [Venezuela Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/venezuela-travel-advisory.html).
