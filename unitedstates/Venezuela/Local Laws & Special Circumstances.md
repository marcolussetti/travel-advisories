# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Application of local laws can at times be arbitrary and/or politically motivated.

In Venezuela, it is illegal to take pictures of sensitive buildings, including the presidential palace, military bases, government buildings, and airports.

Drug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela and treated as such by Venezuelan authorities. Convicted traffickers receive lengthy prison sentences.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, attempt to have someone notify the U.S. Embassy in Bogota immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Please note that the U.S. Department of State may not be informed of your detention, particularly if you also hold Venezuelan citizenship. Due to the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, consular visits to detained U.S. citizens are not possible. There have been instances of U.S. citizens in recent years who have been detained without being afforded due process or fair trial guarantees, or as a pretext for an illegitimate purpose, often due to their U.S. citizenship. U.S. citizens in Venezuela are at risk of wrongful detention. See our [Travel Advisory for Venezuela](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/venezuela-travel-advisory.html) for additional information.

**Currency and Exchange:**  Venezuela has started to allow dollarized commercial transactions and shopping, but policies and availability are subject to change. Some local businesses accept U.S. credit cards and electronic transfers through certain online vendors. “Black market” currency exchanges – often offering significantly favorable exchange rates – are technically prohibited under Venezuelan foreign exchange controls. Violators may be detained by Venezuelan authorities and face criminal penalties.

**Wire Transfers:** Wire transfers cannot be used reliably as a source of emergency funds, and receipt of funds is generally restricted to Venezuelan citizens and residents.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or forfeit the items if you attempt to bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html#ExternalPopup) website for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Venezuela.

See our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Venezuela prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Accessibility is more prevalent in the capital city of Caracas than in the rest of the country.

The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices as well as service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited.
