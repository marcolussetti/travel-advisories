# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* Traffic moves on the left side of the road in Kiribati.
* While satisfactory in some areas, roads in urban Tarawa and Christmas Island generally need repair.
* The main paved roads are on South Tarawa and Kiribati, and the unsealed roads are distributed among 20 islands.
* Unsealed roads in North Tarawa and on outer islands are mostly not connected by bridges, making transit between islets possible only during low tide.
* Road safety is a major concern with a growing incidence of road accidents due to increased traffic, the age and condition of vehicles, and dangerous driving.
* Many local residents use small motorbikes and mopeds for transport; motorists should be aware of these smaller vehicles sharing the road.
* After heavy rains and high tides, some road sections temporarily flood. Traffic proceeds at a relatively slow rate.
* Although it is illegal to drink and drive in Kiribati, it is nonetheless a common occurrence especially on the weekends.
* Since visibility is poor, with no streetlights, driving long distances at night is not recommended, particularly outside of Betio.
* For specific information concerning Kiribati drivers’ permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, please contact the Consulate of the Republic of Kiribati in Honolulu, Hawaii at (808) 834-6775 or [KiribatiConsul@aol.com](mailto:KiribatiConsul@aol.com).

**Traffic Laws:**

* The traffic speed has been reduced in places to 20 km/h or less as a result of road damage, and driving conditions are hazardous, particularly after rain.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal in Kiribati. Mobile phone use while driving is illegal.
* Drivers and passengers are required to use seat belts.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Kiribati, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Kiribati’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Kiribati should check for [U.S. Maritime Advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) , and the [NGA Navigational Warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Kiribati.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the U.S. Coast Guard advises that mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Kiribati should exercise caution.

While Kiribati is an island nation dependent on maritime transportation, vessel conditions and inspection regimens can be less than ideal.  Be aware of boat and ferry exits, and life jacket placement.  Travel schedules and timetables can vary from advertised, and cancellations are not uncommon; build liberal extra timing into other- and outer-island transport.
