# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Permission from the [Government of Kiribati](https://www.mfa.gov.ki/)is required prior to research or filming in Kiribati.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Kiribati.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Customs:**

* Kiribati’s customs authorities strictly prohibit the importation of firearms, ammunition, explosives, counterfeit money and goods, knives, and indecent publications or pornography.
* Strict quarantine laws govern the import of any part of plants, fruits, or vegetables, as well as soil, animals, and animal products.
* Visitors are not allowed to export human remains, artifacts that are 30 or more years old, traditional fighting swords, traditional tools, dancing ornaments, or suits of armor.
* For more information, please contact the Consulate of the Republic of Kiribati in Honolulu at (808) 834-7603 or [via e-mail](mailto:kiribaticonsul@aol.com).

**Currency:** The Australian dollar is the legal currency in Kiribati. Traveler’s checks and all major currencies are accepted by banks and may also be exchanged for local currency at some local hotels. Visa and MasterCard are accepted at most hotels.

**Natural Disasters:** Kiribati is located in an area of high seismic activity. Undersea earthquakes in the South Pacific region can also generate destructive tsunamis. The Government of Kiribati has only limited capability for notifying residents and visitors in the event of a tsunami. If you notice seismic activity and/or unusual tidal activity, you should take immediate precautions, such as seeking higher ground or refuge on an upper floor in a sturdy building. Strong winds are common, especially during the cyclone season from November to April.

General information about natural disaster preparedness is available at the [State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html), as well as from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/)website.
