For emergency services in Kiribati, dial 994 for ambulance and 993 for fire.

Health care throughout Kiribati, including Tarawa, is substandard. Travelers may encounter shortages of routine medications and supplies. Hospital accommodations are inadequate throughout the country, and advanced technology is lacking. Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalization or evacuation to the United States or elsewhere may cost thousands of dollars.

Kiribati has no funeral homes with embalming or cremation services.

Ambulance services are:

* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and often have little or no medical equipment at all.
* Not staffed with trained paramedics
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.
* Limited in availability throughout the country

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas, including in Kiribati, only accept cash payments.  
  
See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.

Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-insurance.htm) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Kiribati Customs](https://kiribati.tradeportal.org/Contacts/2?l=en) and [MFA](https://www.mfa.gov.ki/) to ensure the medication is legal in Kiribati.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/kiribati#vaccines-and-medicines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general:**

* The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

* Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.  Hospitals and medical professionals may require cash payments.

* Medical staff may speak little or no English.

**Water Quality**

* Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.
* You should regard all water as a potential health risk. You should not drink any water that is not bottled, boiled, or otherwise sterilized. You should cook vegetables and peel fruit before eating it.
