# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Prolonged pre-trial detention is common and prison conditions do not meet U.S. standards. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Real Estate Investments:**Be highly cautious. Property rights are irregularly enforced. Clear title to land is difficult or impossible to obtain. Consult an attorney before signing documents or closing on any real estate transactions. Undeveloped land is vulnerable to legal and physical takeover. Absentee owners may be assaulted by squatters when trying to reclaim their property. Litigation and eviction proceedings can take years. U.S. citizens involved in business/property disputes are sometimes arrested without charge and can spend months or years in pre-trial detention, waiting for their cases to be heard. The Embassy does not attend property dispute hearings but, as above, can assist U.S. citizens who have been arrested.

**Firearms and Other Weapons:**Possession of firearms, ammunition, and dangerous weaponry is strictly prohibited to any person, unless the individual has a Haitian license or has been specifically authorized by Haitian authorities.  In order to bring a firearm into Haiti, an owner must obtain written permission in advance from the Director-General of the Haitian National Police (HNP).  Contact the “Centre de Renseignement de la police”/Information Center (CRO) at [cropnh@yahoo.fr](mailto:cropnh@yahoo.fr) or by telephones at 509-3838-1111 /509-3837-1111/509-3839-1111 for additional information.  Travelers caught entering Haiti with any type of weapon, including firearms or ammunitions, will likely face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Haiti.  Visit the Department’s [Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).

**LGB Travelers:**  Anti-LGB sentiment exists. While no laws criminalize sexual orientation or consensual same-sex conduct between adults, persons identified as LGB may be targeted for harassment, discrimination, or physical attacks. Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  The law in Haiti prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is not enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States, however.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.  Businesses rarely accommodate persons with disabilities and Haitian authorities do not enforce laws mandating public access for the disabled. Sidewalks, when present, are frequently congested by sidewalk commerce and parked cars.

**Students:**  See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:**  Domestic violence and sexual assault are unfortunately common and not always investigated or prosecuted consistently or vigorously. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).
