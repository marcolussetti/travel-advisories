# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Embassy employees are prohibited from using public transportation and visiting certain areas of Port-au-Prince due to high crime. Political violence and violent crimes are common in Haiti, including murders, kidnappings, robberies, assaults, vehicle break-ins, and home invasions. Travelers are often targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. For this reason, Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling in personal vehicles to and from the airport. Also, the Embassy has procedures in place to detect surveillance and deter attacks on its employees.

Labadee, a port near Cap Haitien in the north - only accessible by cruise ship passengers - has private security and lower rates of reported crime. Travelers should exercise heightened  precautions,however, due to increasing insecurity nationwide.

**Safety Precautions:**

* Be careful about providing your destination address in Haiti. Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals located in the immigration, customs, or other areas inside or near any airports in Haiti.
* Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.
* As you leave the airport, make sure you are not being followed. If you notice you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station immediately.
* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Keep a low profile.
* Do not display signs of wealth, such as jewelry or watches.
* Embassy employees are prohibited from visiting banks and using ATMs. U.S. citizens are often followed, attacked and robbed soon after withdrawing money. If you must use an ATM, select one that is out of sight from the general public (such as inside your hotel), and be cautious at all times.
* Do not resist a robbery or car-jacking attempt. Criminals may kill those who resist.
* If a situation makes you feel uncomfortable, leave immediately.
* Be aware: drug traffickers have duped travelers into transporting narcotics aboard on commercial flights.
* Be aware: crime rates tend to go up during holidays, particularly in crowded street festivities.

**Victims of Crime, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault:** Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Police investigations may not meet U.S. standards and forensic medical services are very basic. While rape kits exist in Haiti, there is generally no capacity to collect or utilize samples for police investigation. Report crimes to the local police at (+509) 3838-1111 or (+509) 3733-3640, then call the U.S. Embassy at (+509) 2229-8000.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**

No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level in most locations.  With the exception of Labadee, tourists are participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html)

**Hurricanes:**Hurricane season runs from June 1 – November 30 in the Atlantic. Roads and bridges may become impassible. Poor rescue services and weak infrastructure hamper the government’s ability to respond to storms.
