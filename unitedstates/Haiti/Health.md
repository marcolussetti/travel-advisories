The Government of Haiti requires all non-Haiti citizens age 12 and over entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, or to present a negative COVID test.

Medical facilities, including ambulance services, are scarce and generally sub-standard, especially outside the capital. Life-threatening emergencies often require evacuation to a point outside of Haiti by air ambulance at the patient's expense. [Lists of doctors, hospitals, and air ambulance services](https://ht.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/) are available at the Embassy website.

There is no functional national emergency services line in Haiti. The Embassy maintains a [list of emergency telephone contacts.](https://ht.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/emergency-contact/)

Ambulance services may not be reliable in an emergency. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Often not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

**We do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [Haitian Ministry of Public Health](https://www.mspp.gouv.ht/) to ensure the medication is legal in Haiti.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Public medical clinics often lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities.

**Water Quality**

In most areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
