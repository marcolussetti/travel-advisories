# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Always carry your passport with you in Hungary. Local police may require you to show documentation to establish your identity upon request. Hungarian police may take you into custody if you attempt to prove your identity with documents other than a passport.
* Hungary has a zero-tolerance policy for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Penalties are severe, including significant jail time.

Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances regarding Banking and Customs:**

* Travelers’ checks are not universally accepted in Hungary. ATMs are readily available.
* It is not possible to cash personal checks in Hungary without a local bank account, which requires residency.
* Western Union is the most prevalent international money transfer company and has many locations throughout Hungary. You must have photo identification to receive a wire transfer.
* Visit the [National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary](https://nav.gov.hu/en) for information about import and export of potentially restricted items.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Hungary. However, organizers may encounter disruptive behavior by far-right wing extremists at events supporting the LGB community.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Hungary prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility issues may include accessible facilities and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure. There can be a significant difference in accessibility between Budapest and the rest of the country.
