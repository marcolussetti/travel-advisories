# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad, including in Europe. For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Although Hungary is generally a safe place to visit, you should use caution and stay alert. Be especially careful in crowded tourist areas, train stations, buses, trams, and metros.

Passports, cash, and credit cards are favorite targets of thieves. The Embassy regularly receives reports of pickpocketing on the trains between Budapest and Vienna, so please be especially mindful of your belongings when traveling this route. There have been some instances in Budapest where U.S. citizens were overcharged exorbitant prices for food, beverages, or taxi services. Always verify the cost before making a purchase.

There have been incidents, although rare, where U.S. citizens were unknowingly drugged. Do not accept food or drink from anyone but a server. Additionally, the Embassy has received reports of racially motivated assaults. Please report all crimes to the local police. In an emergency dial **112** for help and contact the U.S. Embassy for follow-up assistance.

General tips to avoid becoming a victim of crime:

* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Do not walk alone at night.
* Be vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.
* Stay alert in crowded locations frequented by tourists.
* Always keep your belongings secure.
* Do not accept food or drink from anyone but a server.

**Demonstrations:** Political gatherings and protests occur frequently in Hungary, mostly in Budapest. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Ethnic nationalist groups have gained popularity in Hungary in the past years, in some cases advocating intolerance towards migrants and minorities, including Jews, Roma, and LGB individuals. Although these far-right groups do not engage in violence and are not explicitly anti-United States, you should avoid public demonstrations and confrontations with their members.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and political rallies.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* In a few instances where demonstrations have turned violent, authorities have used riot police to control crowds.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally well-regulated and rules enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.

Outside of major metropolitan centers, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
