Additional information on road conditions is available from “[Útinform](https://www.utinform.hu/en/news/welcome-to-our-newly-redesigned-website!)” at +36-1-336-2400.

**Traffic Laws:** Hungary has zero tolerance for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs. Prison sentences for DUI violations or accidents caused by impaired drivers are severe.

* Police stop vehicles regularly to check documents.

* Car seats are required for infants.
* Children under the age of 12 may not sit in the front seat.
* Seat belt use is mandatory.
* You can drive in Hungary with a valid U.S. driver’s license for one year as long as you have a certified Hungarian translation of the license attached. After one year of residence, you must obtain a Hungarian driver’s license.
* International driver’s permits (IDP) issued by the [American Automobile Association (AAA)](http://www.aaa.com/) are acceptable when used with a valid state driver’s license.

Hungarian police issue traffic violations in the form of a postal check that reflects the amount of the fine. You may pay the fines at any Hungarian post office. Police will confiscate the passport of a person who chooses to contest the fine and issue the person an “invitation letter” to appear at the police station to resolve the dispute. Police will return the passport after resolution and/or payment of the fine.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in Budapest is excellent. Budapest’s tram, subway, and bus service are reliable. Find more information online: [Budapest Public Transport](https://bkk.hu/en/). Public transportation outside of Budapest is not as dependable.

* To avoid being a subject to on-the-spot fines in public transportation, you must follow rules for purchasing and properly validating your ticket.
* Taxis in Budapest are plentiful and generally inexpensive. All taxis are yellow, marked accordingly, and should have meters. The Embassy urges all travelers to insist on using a metered taxi, and to avoid entering into agreements with taxi drivers to an unmetered fare.
* [Hungary’s train service](https://www.mavcsoport.hu/en) is generally reliable. The Embassy regularly receives reports of pickpocketing on the trains between Budapest and Vienna. Be mindful of your belongings when traveling this route.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Hungary’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Hungary’s air carrier operations.
