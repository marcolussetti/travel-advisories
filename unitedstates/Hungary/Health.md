The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also provides [Traveler Health Information for Hungary](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/hungary?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

For emergency services in Hungary dial:

* 104 for Ambulance Services
* 107 for the Police
* 105 for the Fire Department
* **112** for English-Speaking Emergency Responders (All Types of Emergencies)

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://hu.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/?_ga=2.247960071.1016143376.1533631366-925588848.1445437436). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Ambulance services are widely available in Hungary, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. All ambulances may not be equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

Adequate health facilities are available in the capital and other major cities, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

Some hospitals and doctors require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Some private clinics and hospitals may require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Prescription Medication:** Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [government of Hungary](https://ogyei.gov.hu/lists) to ensure the medication is legal in Hungary. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely available at pharmacies.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:** If you are considering traveling to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html). Hungarian law forbids surrogacy arrangements.
