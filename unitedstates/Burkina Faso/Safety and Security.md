[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

See the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Burkina Faso](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/BurkinaFaso.html) and [Worldwide Caution](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html) for current security information.

**Terrorism:** Violent extremist elements, remain active in Bukina Faso and throughout the region. They have specifically targeted Westerners in attacks and kidnappings. Since January 2016, extremist groups have conducted numerous cross-border attacks in the Sahel region. In addition to attacking police stations, customs offices, military posts, and schools in the Sahel region, extremists have attacked Ouagadougou three times since Janaury 2016.

On March 2, 2018, extremists attacked the French Embassy and Burkina Faso’s military headquarters in downtown Ouagadougou. Eight security force personnel, including soldiers and police officers, were killed, and over 80 others were injured. In August 2017, a small group of armed men attacked the Aziz Istanbul Café, a restaurant in downtown Ouagadougou, and killed approximately 19 people.

**Civil Unrest:** Demonstrations may occur throughout Burkina Faso with little or no advance warning. Maintain a surplus of supplies including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies in case you need to shelter-in-place.

U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices, including:

* avoiding large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations;
* maintaining situational awareness and exercise good judgment;
* remaining alert and aware of your surroundings;
* staying abreast of current events through media outlets.

**Crime:** Street crime is prevalent in major cities and foreigners are often directly targeted. Cellular telephones, jewelry, laptops, money and other items of value are the frequent targets of thieves. The majority of street crime is committed after dark and is often perpetrated by one or two individuals on motorbikes. Street crime typically increases in Ouagadougou around the holidays, the bi-annual West African Movie Festival (FESPACO), and the bi-annual Regional Craft Festival (SIAO).

Remain vigilant in crowded areas and secure your personal belongings are at all times. Avoid traveling alone after dark as security risks increase at night. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, travel with a group of people if possible, and avoid poorly lit streets and narrow alleys. Criminals in urban areas may carry a knife or sharp weapon in order to cut the straps on bags, purses, or backpacks and can become violent if the victim resists. Ordinarily, thieves do not threaten victims with weapons, although there have been thefts and attempted thefts involving firearms and knives.

Residential thefts/home invasions occur occasionally in the Ouagadougou expatriate community centered in Ouaga 2000, Koulouba, and Zone du Bois, and in other parts of Ouagadougou. Thieves enter residences at night but generally avoid direct confrontation with the occupants. Most perpetrators exploit an unlocked door or window.

Travel in convoys when outside of major urban areas to deter roadside crime. Robberies can take place anwhere along the country’s roads, but local police cite the Eastern Region beyond Koupela, toward Fada N’Gourma due to its isolated location and intermittent cell phone coverage. According to police statistics, more than half of all reported roadside robbery incidents occurred in the this area. Criminals often use spotters at highway checkpoints and bus stations to identify potential victims. While criminals mainly steal valuables, they may physically harm victims during the course of a robbery.

Exercise caution when traveling along the northern areas of the country near the Mali and Niger borders. The Government of Burkina Faso and the U.S. Embassy have limited ability to provide assistance in the Sahel Reserve region. **The U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori, Djibo, the east-west road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road**. U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same guidance.
