# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions may vary throughout the country. Major urban and intercity roads are paved, but can be narrow and full of potholes. Rural roads outside of major arteries are often in poor condition and roadside assistance is not available.

* Dirt roads are common, even in large cities.
* Vehicles will often enter oncoming traffic to pass or maneuver around obstacles.
* Broken-down vehicles may be abandoned on the road.
* The police rarely enforce traffic laws and there is virtually no police presence on rural roads.
* Emergency services in case of accidents are scarce, underequipped, and nonexistent in most rural areas.

**Traffic Laws:** In addition to regular traffic, there are large volumes of mopeds, bicycles, pedestrians, donkey carts, hand-cranked wheel chairs and push-carts present on main thoroughfares. Drivers must exercise defensive driving to avoid accidents. The law requires moped operators to carry driver’s licenses and wear helmets, but it is not well-enforced.

Roadways are poorly lit, making travel at night especially dangerous. Many cars, mopeds and bicycle riders do not use headlights and are very difficult to see on the roads at night. Flooding is a major problem during the rainy season in parts of Burkina Faso, causing severe damage to roads and buildings.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid using buses and local (green) taxis. Buses have been involved in catastrophic accidents and been targeted by roadside criminals. Green taxis are often mechanically unsafe, pick up multiple passengers in asingle taxi, and have been connected to criminal activity involving its passengers. There are a handful of yellow taxi cab services that are acceptable and utilize centralized dispatchers, fare meters, seatbelts, and well-maintained automobiles. Exercise caution and remain aware of your personal belongings at all times.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burkina Faso, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Burkina Faso’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
