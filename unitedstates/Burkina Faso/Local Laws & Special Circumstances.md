# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Burkina Faso. However, LGB persons are at times threatened and face societal discrimination. Same-sex civil unions or marriages are not recognized by the government, nor do LGB organizations receive official recognition by the government.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Accommodation and accessibility for individuals with disabilities is limited in Burkina Faso. Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities. Most cafés, restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings have stairs at the entrance without wheelchair ramps. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view)

**Women Travelers:** Although the law prohibits violence against women, domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is widely reported. Wives have limited legal recourse in cases of abuse. There is no reliable data on the extent of sexual assault though it is a problem. Rape cases are usually not sent to trial. Police generally investigate reports of rape, but victims often do not file reports due to cultural barriers and fear of reprisal.

The law prohibits Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting, but it is practiced widely, particularly in rural areas, and usually performed at an early age.

See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Early Marriage:** The legal age for marriage is 17 for girls and 20 for boys, but child marriage is a problem. The law prohibits forced marriage. Polygyny is permitted, but a woman must agree to it prior to marriage.
