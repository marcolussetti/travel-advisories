***Updated to reflect changes for travelers with dual nationality***

Do not travel to Burkina Faso for any reason due to **terrorism, crime,** and **kidnapping.**

**Country Summary:** Terrorist organizations continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities throughout Burkina Faso.

**Terrorism**Terrorists may attack anywhere with little or no warning and may utilize various tactics including the use of common, commercially available items or the use of kidnapping for ransom. Targets may include but are not limited to:

* Hotels
* Restaurants
* Police stations
* Customs offices
* Areas at or near mining sites
* Places of worship
* Military posts
* Schools

Visit the U.S. Department of State's [Country Reports on Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

The threat of kidnapping remains persistent throughout Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou and especially in the Sahel and East regions.

**State of Emergency**The Transition Authorities of Burkina Faso have maintained a state of emergency in the following territories:

* The entire Saheland East regions
* The provinces of Kossi and Sourou (Boucle de Mouhoun region)
* The province of Kenedougou (Hauts Bassins region)
* The province of Loroum (North region)
* The province of Koulpelogo (Center-East region)

Due to the risks, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in most of the country. U.S. government employees working in Burkina Faso are prohibited from traveling to regions outside the capital due to security concerns.

Due to a historically high crime rate, the U.S. Embassy discourages U.S. government personnel from nighttime travel to the Balkiui and Rayongo (also known as Dayongo) neighborhoods of Ouagadougou’s Arrondissement 11.
