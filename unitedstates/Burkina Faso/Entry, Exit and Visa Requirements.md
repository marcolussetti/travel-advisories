Visit the [Embassy of Burkina Faso](http://burkina-usa.org/the-embasy/visas/) website for the most current visa information.

We strongly urge U.S. citizens to acquire visas for Burkina Faso before traveling. U.S. citizens traveling to Burkina Faso can apply for a five-year multiple-entry or one-time transit visa by mail or in person at the Embassy of Burkina Faso.

Upon arrival to Burkina Faso, U.S. travelers may apply for the following visas.

* A one-time transit visa;
* Single-entry and multiple-entry visas with a maximum validity of three months;
* And five-year multiple entry visas available at the Visa Office of Ouagadougou located in Gounghin.

Several companies that offer visa services, but have no affiliation with the Government of Burkina Faso, have set up sites to resemble the Embassy of Burkina Faso. The correct web address for the [Embassy of Burkina Faso in Washington DC](http://www.burkina-usa.org) is [www.burkina-usa.org](http://www.burkina-usa.org); the site for [Burkina Faso’s Permanent Mission to the UN](http://www.burkina-onu.org) is [www.burkina-onu.org](http://www.burkina-onu.org).

Travelers older than nine months should have proof of yellow fever immunizations, or you may be denied entry.
