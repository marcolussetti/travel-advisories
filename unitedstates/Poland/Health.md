**Adequate medical care is available, but the quality of hospitals and nursing support may not be comparable to U.S. standards in all regions of Poland**. Emergency services may be lacking in small towns and rural areas. Physicians are generally well-trained, and many younger doctors speak English (nurses and staff may not). While medication and treatment are generally substantially less costly than in the United States, **doctors and hospitals often expect cash payment prior to treatment**. Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals. Medication, while generally available, may not be U.S. brand-name drugs.

For emergency services in Poland, **dial 112**. Ambulance services are widely available.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://pl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**The U.S. government does not pay overseas medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance in lieu of payment at the time services are provided.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments up front, and you will have to seek reimbursement later from your medical insurance. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health Poland](https://www.gov.pl/web/zdrowie)to ensure the medication is legal in Poland and the [Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate](https://www.gov.pl/web/chief-pharmaceutical-inspectorate/transport-of-narcotic-and-psychotropic-substances-necessary-for-medical-treatment-when-crossing-the-border-of-the-republic-of-poland) to find information on traveling to and from Poland with narcotic and psychotropic medications.

**Vaccinations**

The CDC does not recommend and there is no requirement for specific vaccinations for U.S. citizen travelers.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. U.S. citizens traveling to Poland for medical tourism or elective surgery should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Pharmaceuticals**

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for use in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely) websites for more information.

**Water Quality**

Food and water standards in Poland are similar to those in the United States. Most travelers do not need to take special food or water precautions beyond what they normally do at home.

**Adventure Travel**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).

**Air Quality**

* Cities in Poland have higher air pollution levels than major U.S. cities. Especially in Krakow, levels are often above U.S. health-based standards in the winter. Air quality is often good to moderate during warmer months. Visit [the European Environment Agency’s website](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index/index) for information on air quality in Poland.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Poland.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
