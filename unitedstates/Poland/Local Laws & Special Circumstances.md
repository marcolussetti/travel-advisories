# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. **A U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.**

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate immediately**. Under Polish law, a person with Polish and U.S. citizenship is deemed to be a Polish citizen; however, dual U.S.-Polish nationals may still ask to see a U.S. consular officer. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:  
Polish Law prohibits possession of firearms or ammunition without proper permits.** In Poland, it is illegal to possess, carry, transport, import or export arms or ammunition without proper authorization. Polish law broadly defines the meaning of “arms” to include items that may put life or health at risk, which may include parts of firearms or ammunition. Travelers have been arrested who were in possession of military items without proper permits. Please visit the [Government of Poland’s website to find out more about obtaining a permit](https://www.gov.pl/web/usa-en/transport-of-arms-and-ammunition) and our [website on traveling with firearms](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).

**Polish Customs enforces strict regulations concerning the export of items such as works of art.** Contact the[Polish Embassy](https://www.gov.pl/web/usa-en/embassy-washington) in Washington, D.C., or a Polish consulate in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, or Houston for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Taking pictures of Polish military buildings or other national security/restricted objects is illegal.**

Penalties are severe for possessing, using, or trafficking **illegal drugs** in Poland. Expect **long jail sentences** and **heavy fines** if convicted.

Local police can stop a car and request identification to establish identity and may ask the driver subsequent questions.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Information about conducting business in Poland can be found at the [U.S. Embassy’s website](https://pl.usembassy.gov/business/).

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, including Poland, they may still be illegal according to local laws. Possessing or purchasing them is against the law. You may be subject to heavy fines and even imprisonment. You must also relinquish the items if you bring them back to the United States. For more information, see the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips), the [Polish Ministry of Finance Customs](https://www.gov.pl/web/kas/dc?) Department, and the [European Commission](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/customs-4/prohibitions-and-restrictions/counterfeit-piracy-and-other-ipr-violations_en).

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on either consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults or the organization of LGB events in Poland. Polish law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation and the government enforces these provisions. The social acceptance of LGB individuals is not as prevalent as in the United States, though polling indicates tolerance is steadily increasing. Some politicians have made derogatory comments about LGB persons. Media have not recently reported on physical and verbal attacks against LGB persons, but community members have reported concerns about their physical safety. Travelers identifying openly as LGB may face harassment. The practice of conversion therapy is legal and offered on a voluntary basis.

See our [LGB Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: Polish law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but some discrimination occurs. Polish law states that buildings should be accessible for persons with disabilities, but in practice, many buildings remain inaccessible. Newer public trains, vehicles, and stations may be accessible, but older ones are not. Wheelchair users will find many challenges throughout the country. Service animals are generally allowed in public buildings and on transportation. Pedestrian crossings at intersections in large cities are generally equipped with audible crossing signals.
