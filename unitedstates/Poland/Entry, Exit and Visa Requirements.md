U.S. citizens who do not meet one of the listed exceptions, but who want to return/evacuate from Belarus to the United States in transit through Poland or who need to enter Poland for humanitarian reasons, may seek a special permit to enter Poland only at the border crossing point in Brest-Terespol.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least three months beyond the period of stay.** If you plan on transiting a Schengen country, review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need **sufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/visa-policy/applying-schengen-visa_en)

**Military/Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Travelers**: Active-duty U.S. military personnel may enter Poland under the SOFA with proper Department of Defense (DOD) identification and travel orders. All SOFA family members, civilian employees, and contractors must have valid passports. Active-duty military personnel should obtain a tourist passport before leaving the United States to accommodate off-duty travel. DOD travelers should consult with their unit for clearance before leaving the United States.

If you are transiting Poland *en route* to other countries, **know all entry and exit requirements for your final destination**. You may be denied boarding for your connecting flight if you have incorrect documentation or insufficient validity on your passport. If you are denied boarding, you will need sufficient funds and a return airline ticket or an itinerary that does not require re-entry into the Schengen zone in order to return to the United States.
