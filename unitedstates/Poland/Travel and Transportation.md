**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions in Poland differ significantly from those in the United States. Poland has the fourth-highest road fatality rate based on population in the European Union. Driving, especially after dark, is hazardous. Roads are sometimes narrow, poorly lit, frequently under repair (especially in summer), and are often also used by pedestrians and cyclists. Pedestrians account for approximately one-fourth of all traffic fatalities in Poland.

* Polish roadside services, while not equal to those in the United States, are adequate. The Polish Automobile Association ([Polski Związek Motorowy Auto-Tour](https://www.pzpm.org.pl/en)) has multilingual operators and provides assistance countrywide 24/7. Call (22) 532-8403 or email [autotour@pzm.pl](mailto:autotour@pzm.pl).
* The police emergency number is **997**, fire service is **998**, ambulance service is **999**, and the general emergency number is **112.**

**Traffic Laws: You must have a U.S. driver's license and International Driving Permit (IDP) in order to drive in Poland**. U.S. citizens **cannot** obtain IDPs in Poland. If you stay in Poland for more than six months and continue to drive, you must obtain a Polish driver’s license. You can find information on obtaining an International Driving Permit [here](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html).

* **Seat belt use is mandatory**.
* **Use headlights year-round at all times**.
* **Children under 12 must sit in rear seats**. Children under 12 and shorter than 4’11” must use a child’s car seat.
* **Using hand-held cell phones while driving is prohibited**.
* **Polish law provides zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs**. Prison sentences for DUI violations or accidents caused by impaired drivers can range from two to twelve years.
* **Fines for traffic violations can be substantial**. Non-residents are expected to pay the police officer at the time the ticket is issued. Be prepared to pay in cash in local currency.

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation in Poland is efficient, inexpensive, and safe. A ticket is required when boarding a bus or tram and if the ticket is not validated upon entry, you may be fined. In cities, taxis are available at major hotels and designated taxi stands and can be ordered in advance by phone.

**Avoid taxis without a company name and/or telephone number printed on the light bar**. Make sure that the driver displays his or her license inside the vehicle, has a functioning meter, and uses the meter when starting your trip. At airports in Poland, including Warsaw’s Chopin Airport, only use taxis found at designated stands and avoid unregistered taxi stalls.

**Apps-based Ride Sharing:** Internet-based ride services, such as Uber, iTaxi, and Freenow, are legal in Poland and growing in popularity as a safe ride option. Some ride service apps offer rides for women by women drivers. However, some internet-based ride services may not be authorized to drop off or pick up patrons in some downtown tourist areas.
