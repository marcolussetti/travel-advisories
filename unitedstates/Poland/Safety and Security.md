# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** While Poland has a low crime rate overall, the risk of crime is higher in major cities.

* **Safeguard your belongings in public areas**. Thieves and pickpockets operate at major tourist destinations, railroad stations, and on trains (particularly overnight trains), trams, and buses. Report incidents of theft to the police.
* **Do not leave valuables in plain sight inside vehicles**.
* If someone directs you to pull over or signals that something is wrong with your car, **continue driving until you reach a safe spot** (such as a crowded gas station, supermarket, or a police station) to inspect your vehicle.
* **Only change money at banks or legitimate exchange kiosks (kantor).** ATMs at commercial banks, large hotels, shopping malls, and airports are safest.
* While casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, some are affiliated with or have attracted the interest of **organized crime.**
* **Avoid adult entertainment venues**. Such establishments have been known to present foreign customers with inflated charges and threaten those who refuse to pay. There have been some incidents of suspected drink spiking associated with these venues.
* **Travel in a group** when going out at night to nightclubs, discos, bars, or high-tourism areas, such as the Market Square in Krakow and Old Town in Warsaw.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Poland. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, you should refer them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting (kidnapping, arrested, medical emergency)
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the local police. Report crimes to the local police by **calling 112** (multilingual emergency dispatch centers serving Poland and EU countries), and contact the [U.S. Embassy](https://pl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/) in Warsaw at +48 (22) 504-2000 or the U.S. Consulate in Krakow at +48 (12) 424-5100. **Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.**
