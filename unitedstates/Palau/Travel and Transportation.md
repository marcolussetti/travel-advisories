**Road Conditions and Safety:** While in Palau, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. There are no traffic lights. Fatalities caused by driving under the influence are frequent.

**Traffic Laws:** Palau accepts a driver's license issued by a U.S. state or military authority for up to 30 days. After 30 days in Palau, any foreign driver must obtain a Palauan driver license. Please contact the [Bureau of Public Safety](https://www.palaugov.pw/executive-branch/ministries/justice/bureau-of-public-safety/) at (680) 488-2423 for more information and requirements.

* Passing slow-moving vehicles is illegal. The national speed limit is 25 miles per hour. Drivers routinely ignore this limit in remote areas on good-quality roads. Traffic often moves slower in congested areas.
* It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs to drive any vehicle in Palau.
* Currently there is no law in place restricting mobile phone use while driving, though it is not advisable. Drivers and passengers must wear seatbelts.
* Cars drive on the right in Palau. However, most cars imported from Japan and are designed to drive on the left. This can be slightly confusing for visitors renting a car.

**Public Transportation:** The main available mode of transportation for tourists is private drivers for hire. Such drivers are plentiful in Koror and offer comfortable travel. They are not metered, and fares are fixed (drivers carry a rate sheet which you can ask to see). It is common to hire the services of a specific driver for the duration of your stay and call them each time you need a ride. Some restaurants offer a pick-up service. Restaurants, hotels, and activity centers will call a driver for you. However, private taxi companies, or services like Uber or Lyft are **not** available.

Koror also has a public bus system offering limited services on weekdays and during certain special events. Bus fare is one dollar (subject to change). The bus is generally clean and safe.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Palau, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Palau’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Palau should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
