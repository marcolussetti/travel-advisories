# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets

**Crime:** Although the crime rate in Palau is relatively low, you might be the target of petty and sometimes violent crime as well as other random acts against individuals and property. Please stay alert for your personal safety and protect your valuables.

**Unexploded ordnance:** Unexploded ordnance from World War II (UXO) remains a problem in Palau. Although the majority of the land-based UXO is found on the island of Peleliu, UXO can be found almost on any island in Palau. Underwater UXO may also present a threat. Heed all warnings on areas that might be affected. Use extreme caution when hiking or scuba diving.

**Cyclone Season:** The official cyclone season is November through April.  However, severe storms, including tropical depressions, are possible outside the official season. The [Palau National Weather Service](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weather.gov%2Fgum%2FWSOPalau&data=05%7C02%7CChesbroJK%40state.gov%7Cff20538e4851480f368008dd44d41df0%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638742400001701323%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=H7l1iojqtUwz25M3dJQkf%2BcRNLlu7qXbiG4KDaOU8rA%3D&reserved=0), in partnership with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), tracks weather systems for Palau and other islands in the Pacific.
