**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Republic of Palau Customs](https://www.palaugov.pw/executive-branch/ministries/finance/bureau-of-customs-and-border-protection/) to ensure the medication is legal in the Republic of Palau.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.

**Health facilities:** The U.S. Embassy maintains [a list of doctors, clinics, and hospitals.](https://pw.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Health facilities in Palau are adequate for routine medical care, but the availability of care is limited and quality varies. Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalizations or evacuation to the United States or elsewhere may cost tens of thousands of dollars.

The Belau National Hospital accepts payments in cash or debit/credit card. Private clinics also accept cash and debit/credit cards payments. There are only three private clinics in Palau.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Water Quality:**In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel:**The only hyperbaric chamber available for divers is located at the Belau National Hospital in Meyuns, Koror. Many popular dive sites are far away from Koror.
