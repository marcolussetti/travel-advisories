Palau Entry Form submissions must made be within 72 hours or less prior to your arrival time in the Republic of Palau. Your response must be in English. Only ONE form is required per family or single traveler. Once you fill in the form, a unique QR code will be sent to your email. Each traveler must present a copy of their completed Palau Entry Form or unique QR Code upon arrival at the Palau International Airport.

U.S. citizens visiting Palau do not need a visa. To visit Palau, you must have a passport valid for at least six months at the time of entry. This requirement does not apply to U.S. military personnel traveling on official business.

Every visitor coming to Palau is assessed a $100 environmental fee. Airlines are required to include the fee in the price of a ticket to Palau.

Diplomats and transit passengers are exempt from the $100 Palau Paradise Environmental Fee (PPEF). They are eligible for a cash refund upon arrival or departure. Refunds for official travelers are expected to be returned to their sponsoring agency. They must present their passport, along with a travel itinerary indicating that the $100 fee was paid.
