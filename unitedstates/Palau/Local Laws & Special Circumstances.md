# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be deported, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Firearms:** Firearms of any kind are strictly prohibited in Palau. The penalty for possession of a firearm or ammunition is up to 15 years imprisonment. Palau customs authorities strictly regulate other weapons and related items entering or exiting Palau. You should contact the [Embassy of Palau](http://www.palauembassy.org/) in Washington, D.C., for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Curfew:** Police may enforce a curfew imposed by traditional leaders in Koror (where most tourist facilities are located), Airai, and Ngarchelong between midnight and 5:00 a.m.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Palau prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.

Palau’s overall accessibility for the disabled is very limited. While many buildings have ramps to facilitate persons with disabilities, others do not. There is no public transportation equipped to transport persons on wheelchairs and sidewalks around Palau are limited.

There is no legislation mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. The only existing legislation requires that there be at least one designated parking space close to the main entrance of each national government building open to the public.
