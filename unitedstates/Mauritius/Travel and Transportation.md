# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Most roads are narrow and uneven, lack guardrails, and are bordered by deep ditches. Night driving is hazardous, particularly on country roads, due to inadequate street lighting, narrow roads, and cyclists riding without lights.

**Traffic Laws:** A valid U.S. driver’s license is required. For more information, contact the Mauritius Police Force Traffic Branch at +230-211-8434, +230-208-6077 or via email at [cctb.mpf@govmu.org](mailto:cctb.mpf@govmu.org). Drive on the left side of the road. Drivers and all passengers must wear seat belts. Drivers and passengers on motorcycles are required to wear helmets. Babies and toddlers must be placed in child seats. It is illegal to use your phone and drive. Mauritian authorities implemented a zero tolerance drinking and driving law in 2018; anyone planning to drink while out should make alternate arrangements.

**Accidents:** When no injury has occurred, motorists may exchange information and report details to the authorities. Foreigners should remain at the scene and request the assistance of local law enforcement.

**Public Transportation:**

**Buses:** Public and private buses run between main towns between 5:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. and in

remote areas until 6:00 p.m.

**Taxis:** Book taxis in advance if traveling at night. Uber is not available in Mauritius.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mauritius, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mauritius’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Mauritius should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s [Maritime Security Communications with Industry](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/office-security/msci-portal/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal) webpage. Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/)and as a broadcast warning on the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website](https://www.nga.mil/Pages/Default.aspx).
