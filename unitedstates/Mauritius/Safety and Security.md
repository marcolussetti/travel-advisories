# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Precautions:**

* Keep valuables locked in a hotel room safe.
* Be aware of surroundings, especially at night.
* Avoid demonstrations. Even events intended to be peaceful can turn violent.
* Maintain caution at public gatherings and areas frequented by foreigners.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, monitor local media, and [the Embassy’s Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/usembassy.portlouis) page and [Website](https://mu.usembassy.gov/).

**Crime:** Most criminal activity directed against foreigners is non-violent. Non-violent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing, purse snatchings, and petty thefts, occur in crowded outdoor shopping areas, including areas that cater to the robust tourist industry, and have occurred near ATMs. Tourists should be alert for petty scams by street vendors and inflated “tourist prices” in markets. Women walking by themselves may be at greater risk for verbal harassment and criminal targeting. Individual violent crimes (serious assaults, murder, rape) are known to occur.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available on the main island of Mauritius.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. Visitors to Rodrigues or other islands may require evacuation to the main island of Mauritius for urgent care.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage.](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html)
