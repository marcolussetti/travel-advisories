# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in prison sentences up to 35 years and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Beach wear:** Nudism is not permitted. Topless sunbathing is acceptable on certain beaches.

**Phone Service:** Cellular phones are widely used on the main islands, though there are coverage gaps in some remote areas. Local SIM cards can be purchased to use with a compatible cell phone.

**Currency:** The Mauritian Rupee (MUR) is the official currency. U.S. dollars and euros are also accepted at major tourist hotels or shops. ATMs are available at the international airport and around the major tourist destinations, and malls, but only dispense Mauritian Rupees. Credit cards, such as Visa and MasterCard, are accepted in all resorts and generally in urban areas and locations commonly visited by tourists.

**LGB Travelers:** While the law does not specifically criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity, LGB individuals may face societal discrimination, harassment, and abuse by families, neighbors, and police. Sodomy is a criminal offense among both same-sex and heterosexual couples, with penalties up to five years’ imprisonment.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Access to transportation, lodging, and public buildings is limited. There are few sidewalks and most buildings lack functioning elevators.
