**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. All care providers expect payment in Mauritian Rupees.

Consult the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/mauritius) for Mauritius prior to travel.

Medical attention is adequate at major hospitals and private clinics. Emergency ambulance service is available, but of variable quality and speed.

Recommendations:

* Carry prescription medication in original packaging.
* Verify with the [Embassy of the Republic of Mauritius](https://govmu.org/EN/Pages/default.aspx) that your medications are legal before traveling. Drugs such as tranquillizers, hypnotics, narcotics and strong pain killers require prior authorization.
* Check details with the [Mauritius Ministry of Health](https://health.govmu.org/Pages/default.aspx)

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

The following diseases are prevalent:

* [Hepatitis A](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-a)
* [Typhoid](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever)

Please note that passengers may be quarantined during seasonal plague outbreaks IF travelling from plague-infected countries.

**HIV/AIDS**

HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing among the population, especially tied to intravenous drug use.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)recommended by the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/). [Yellow fever](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever#5291) vaccination is required for entry if arriving from a country with risk of yellow fever.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Mauritius.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.
