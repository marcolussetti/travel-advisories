# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Ensure your passport is stamped when you enter the country. There have been reports of officials intentionally not stamping passports of visitors entering the country. When this occurs, visitors are unable to prove they legally entered.

**Visa Requirements:** See the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic’s [website](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/-Embassy-of-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-in-the-USA-and-Canada/Menu---Foreign-/Consular-issues/Visa-issues/isa-issues-5c3dfa333cdaf) for visa information.

U.S. citizens who enter the Kyrgyz Republic without a visa may stay up to 60 days but must depart and remain outside of the Kyrgyz Republic for an equal amount of time. In other words, in a 120-day period, they may be present in the Kyrgyz Republic for 60 days.

Travelers who plan to stay longer than 60 days should apply for the appropriate visa category [electronically](https://evisa.e-gov.kg/step_1.php?lng=en) and register their stay with the appropriate government body. Additional information on the registration process can be found on the website for the [Ministry of Digital Development of the Kyrgyz Republic](https://digital.gov.kg/en/). Travelers who stay longer than their allotted 60 days must pay an administrative fine, apply for an exit visa prior to their departure, and should contact the Consular Department of the MFA in advance of their departure if they know that they have overstayed their visa-free period. Individuals who are already in the country and who need to register their stay should be able to do so without leaving the country.

Travelers can contact the Consular Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with questions by calling +996 312 663 070, +996 703 428 865 (WhatsApp) or email at [**e-visa@mfa.gov.kg**](mailto:e-visa@mfa.gov.kg)**.**

A ten-year, multi-entry visa is also available at any Kyrgyz embassy abroad. Details can be found at this site: [Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic in the USA and Canada.](https://mfa.gov.kg/en/dm/-Embassy-of-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-in-the-USA-and-Canada/Menu---Foreign-/Consular-issues/Visa-issues/isa-issues-5c3dfa333cdaf) For the most up-to-date visa information and information regarding entry/exit requirements, contact the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic.

If you travel to the Kyrgyz Republic in any religious capacity, you must register with the State Commission on Religious Affairs.

Journalists traveling to the Kyrgyz Republic for work should obtain the appropriate visa at the nearest Kyrgyz Embassy prior to their arrival. In addition to visas, journalists are also required to register their stay and receive Ministry of Foreign Affairs approval to conduct press activities in country.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** Some HIV/AIDS restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents in the Kyrgyz Republic. An HIV test is required to apply for a work visa.
