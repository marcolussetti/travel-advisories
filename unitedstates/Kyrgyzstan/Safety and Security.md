# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** The greatest threat to travelers is street crime. There have been reports of muggings of foreigners in downtown Bishkek at night and areas outside of Bishkek. You should limit travel to the Batken province (Oblast). Other common crimes include auto theft and pickpocketing in crowded places such as markets, especially Bishkek’s Osh Bazaar, large department stores, internet cafes, and on public transportation. While violent crime is rare in Bishkek, attackers do not always avoid violent confrontation with their victims.

The police are generally responsive to reports of crimes.

Harassment and extortion by imposters, genuine law enforcement, and other officials does occur. Never voluntarily give your wallet to anybody. If pressured by a police officer, tell the officer that you will report his behavior to the U.S. Embassy and to the officer’s supervisors. Try to obtain the officer's name, badge number, and license plate number, and note where the incident happened.

**Demonstrations** are rare due to a ban on demonstrations outside a single location in Bishkek. Despite the ban, spontaneous demonstrations sometimes take place in response to political or economic issues, such as protests in May 2024 targeting Indian and Pakistani students studying in Bishkek.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**The security situation remains fluid in areas along the Kyrgyz-Tajik border** due to ethnic and cross-border tensions, as well as the presence of narco-trafficking routes. Border areas in Batken province are closed to foreigners and travel restrictions requiring a permit are enforced along the Chinese and Tajik borders. Border areas with Tajikistan in Batken province are particularly sensitive and the location of a significant police and military presence. U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to Batken province without prior authorization from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek.

**International Financial Scams**: See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +996 (312) 597 000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Crisis centers exist in some main cities across Kyrgyzstan, but English-language assistance may be limited.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
