# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits, or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

You must carry your passport, or a certified copy, with you at all times. If you are stopped by local officials, they may request proof of identity, citizenship, and permission to be in the Kyrgyz Republic (visa or entry stamp).

You may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you. For a fee and with a scheduled appointment, the U.S. Embassy can provide you with a certified copy of your passport, which may be used in lieu of a physical passport if stopped by local officials.

It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking pictures of anything of possible military or security interest, including government buildings, people in police or military uniforms, and food markets.

The legal blood alcohol level for driving in the Kyrgyz Republic is zero. Driving under the influence may land you immediately in jail, no matter how little you consumed.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in the Kyrgyz Republic are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: It is illegal to proselytize.  Missionaries and foreign preachers must register with the State Commission for Religious Affairs (SCRA) before carrying out religious services.  All religious activities organized in public locations other than churches, mosques, temples, or official places of worship must be approved by SCRA at least 10 days in advance.  It is recommended that travelers check with a host organization to ensure their participation in local spiritual activities conforms to religious laws and regulations.  See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report.](https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/?#wrapper)

**LGB Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on  same-sex sexual relations in the Kyrgyz Republic.   However, the Kyrgyz Republic does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and individuals may be subject to discrimination and prosecution in the application of other laws that are used to disproportionately target persons on the basis of sexual orientation. Many lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals report that they are often threatened, harassed, and/or extorted by law enforcement officials.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/)s for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in the Kyrgyz Republic prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Access to sidewalks and public buildings may be limited due to a lack of ramps or access points. Public infrastructure is limited and may be in poor condition. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Conditions in rural or outlying areas are substantially worse than in developed areas.

Limited possibilities exist for repair or replacement of personal aids/equipment/devices. Sign language interpretation options are limited. Personal assistants are available but may not have comparable training or experience to personal assistants in the United States.

**Women Travelers:** Forced marriage, bridal kidnapping, and high rates of domestic violence are known trends in the Kyrgyz Republic.

**U.S. Service Members:** Country clearance through Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS) is required before arrival.

**Hunting and Adventure Travel:** It is illegal to hunt without a proper license. You must obtain a permit from the Kyrgyz government prior to arrival in country to import or own firearms in the country.

Foreigners who do not have official permission to hunt or take animals out of the country may face criminal and/or civil charges.

Hikers and adventure travelers should be prepared for unexpected weather like rockslides, mudslides, avalanches, heavy rain and snow with little to no warning. Cell phone reception in popular hiking areas is limited or nonexistent. Search and rescue response is extremely limited, and local teams do not have the resources or capabilities of rescue teams in North American and European countries.

**Mobile Device Registration:** All mobile devices sold in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic**,** imported through international postal or cargo shipments, and/or brought by the user from abroad for personal use must have their IMEI codes registered in the Kyrgyz government system for identifying communication devices. IMEI codes of devices using roaming SIM cards (SIM cards of foreign telecommunication operators) do not require registration with the State Identification System.
