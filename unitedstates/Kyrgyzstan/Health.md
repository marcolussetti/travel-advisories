Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

Hospitals and doctors often require payment prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.

U.S. citizens often travel outside of the Kyrgyz Republic for medical treatment, including for routine procedures. Medical staff in the Kyrgyz Republic rarely speak English, and prices for treatment are not fixed.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

For emergency services in the Kyrgyz Republic, **dial 112**.

Ambulance services are not widely available, and the training and availability of emergency responders may be well below U.S. standards. Emergency responders may not be present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Bishkek, Osh, and other large cities. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and are typically not staffed with trained paramedics. Injured or seriously ill travelers, particularly outside of metropolitan areas, may prefer to take a taxi, private ambulance, or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Tuberculosis is prevalent in the Kyrgyz Republic.
