Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

Hospitals and doctors often require payment prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.

U.S. citizens often travel outside of the Kyrgyz Republic for medical treatment, including for routine procedures. Medical staff in the Kyrgyz Republic rarely speak English, and prices for treatment are not fixed.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

For emergency services in the Kyrgyz Republic, **dial 112**.

Ambulance services are not widely available, and the training and availability of emergency responders may be well below U.S. standards. Emergency responders may not be present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Bishkek, Osh, and other large cities. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and are typically not staffed with trained paramedics. Injured or seriously ill travelers, particularly outside of metropolitan areas, may prefer to take a taxi, private ambulance, or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Medications:** Always carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Prescriptions must be translated into Russian. Check with the Ministry of Health’s register of medications to ensure that your medication is legal in the Kyrgyz Republic.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.

Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in the Kyrgyz Republic. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors
