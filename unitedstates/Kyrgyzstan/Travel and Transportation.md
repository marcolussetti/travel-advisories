# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic accidents involving serious injury to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are common.

Many city roads are hazardous due to potholes, uncovered manholes, poor lighting, and pedestrians ignoring oncoming traffic.

There is no roadside assistance infrastructure. Outside of metropolitan areas, roads are generally poor.

Mountain roads in the Kyrgyz Republic are often narrow and treacherous, and may close without notice due to snow, ice, or rockslides. Guardrails and barriers are often missing. Livestock is free ranging throughout the country and many horses and cattle can be found on the roads at night.

**Traffic Laws:** You must obey all local traffic laws. Passengers must wear seat belts and motorcycle riders must wear helmets.

Drunk driving and hit-and-run accidents are significant problems.

Drivers often speed on the newly upgraded roads that connect main cities and towns.

Many local drivers do not stop at red lights, pass vehicles when it is dangerous or prohibited to do so, drive into oncoming traffic, and do not stop for pedestrians.

Traffic police have been known to demand payment of arbitrary "fines" for purported infractions. Payment of traffic fines should be made at local banks. Some police vehicles now offer terminals for individuals with bank cards to pay their fines immediately.

International driving permits are recognized in the Kyrgyz Republic.

**Public Transportation**: Buses tend to be very crowded and can be unsafe and unreliable.

U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from utilizing public transportation due to the potential for crime, sexual harassment, and assault.

Avoid using "private taxis" and unmarked taxis or entering a cab that already contains passengers.

Taxis ordered by telephone typically charge based on set rates; the driver’s cellular phone operates as the meter.

If hailing a taxi on the street, negotiate a fare prior to entering a cab. Cab drivers often try to charge foreigners a higher fare. Many taxi services now have cabs equipped with meters, but passengers should confirm that they are functional before entering the cab.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in the Kyrgyz Republic, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
