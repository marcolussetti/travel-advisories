Medical care in Estonia falls short of Western standards outside the larger cities such as Tallinn, Tartu, and Pärnu.  Many medical professionals in Estonia are highly-trained, but some hospitals and clinics still suffer from a lack of equipment and resources.  Many doctors speak at least some English but most nursing staff speak only Russian or Estonian.

For emergency services in Estonia, dial 112.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash or credit card payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the Estonian [Agency of Medicines](https://www.ravimiamet.ee/en/travelling-medicinal-products) to ensure the medication is legal in Estonia.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**General Health Information:**

The following diseases are prevalent:

* Like much of Europe, outbreaks of measles are frequent in Estonia and travelers should have two documented doses of MMR vaccine prior to traveling.
* [Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/tickborne-encephalitis) and [Lyme-disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html) are widespread throughout the country.  Use [CDC recommended insect repellents](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/noninfectious-health-risks/mosquitoes-ticks-and-other-arthropods) containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 to help diminish bites from ticks and other insects if you intend to visit parks or forested areas (even within parks in Tallinn).  Those who will be camping or have prolonged outdoor exposure should pretreat clothing and equipment with permethrin.
* There are no vaccines against Lyme disease.
