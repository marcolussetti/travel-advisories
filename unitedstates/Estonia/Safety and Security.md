# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

The current Department of State Travel Advisory assesses Estonia at Level 1, indicating travelers should exercise normal precautions when coming to the country.  There is minimal risk from terrorism in Tallinn.  There are no known homegrown terrorist organizations in Estonia, which is not a known base of support/sympathy for terrorists.

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe.  European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks.  All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** There is minimal risk from crime in Estonia. Pickpocketing, theft, and petty crime do occur, particularly in crowded areas and areas where tourists and foreigners congregate. Pickpockets use various diversionary tactics to distract victims; one method involves bumping the victim in an effort to draw their attention to one individual, while another takes their wallet. Victims should report the crime to the police and cancel their credit cards as soon as possible.

The majority of incidents affecting U.S. citizens involve individuals who are alone and/or intoxicated at night. Visitors who consume alcohol should exercise moderation and designate a sober member of the group to be in charge of security awareness. Statistics indicate incidents against individuals based on race, religion, or sexual orientation are limited; however the Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being harassed due to their race.

**Demonstrations:**  Large demonstrations occur infrequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Demonstrations can be unpredictable and U.S. citizens should exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations.  Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Estonia.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Victims of Crime:**  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(372) 668-8128.  Victims of crime may also call 116 006 to contact Estonia’s Social Insurance Board’s Victim Support and Prevention Services Department to speak to a victim support worker.  For social welfare emergencies, such as domestic violence or child abuse, dial 112 (English-speaking operators are sometimes available).  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
