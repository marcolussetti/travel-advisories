**Road Conditions and Safety:**  Estonian roads and highways can be icy and dangerous during winter months and some rural roads are unpaved. Falling large icicles from buildings, in addition to slippery roads and sidewalks, can be a potentially deadly problem in winter and spring.

**Traffic Laws:**  Driving while intoxicated is a very serious offense and carries heavy penalties.  The Estonian legal system takes a zero-tolerance approach, and even one drink can lead to a DUI arrest.

If you plan to drive in Estonia, you must have a valid U.S. driver’s license.  Licenses which do not include a symbol and description of the vehicle category the driver is licensed to operate must be accompanied by a valid International Driving Permit (IDP).  IDPs can be obtained from either the [American Automobile Association](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) (AAA) or the [American Automobile Touring Alliance](http://aataidp.com/) before departing the United States.  Details can be found on [Estonia’s Road Administration website](https://www.transpordiamet.ee/en).  Car rental companies may have additional requirements.

If you have an Estonian residence permit, you must obtain an Estonian driver’s license.  Contact the [Estonian Transport Administration](https://eteenindus.mnt.ee/maantee.jsf?lang=en)(ARK) for information on obtaining an Estonian driver’s license.

* You must use your headlights at all times.
* The use of seatbelts, both front and rear, is mandatory in Estonia, as are car seats for infants.
* Talking on cell phones while driving is prohibited, except when using a hands-free system.
* It is illegal to turn right on a red light.
* Winter tires are required every year from December 1 to March 1.
* Do not attempt to move the vehicle to the side of the road until the police reach the scene if you are in an accident.  To request roadside assistance or towing service, dial 1888.
* Pedestrians have the right of way in Estonia and may step out into the road suddenly.

**Public Transportation:**  Public transportation is generally considered safe, but travelers are encouraged to select well-marked taxis.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.  Visit the website of [Estonia’s national tourist office](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/travel-here-around/travel-around-estonia#in-your-own-car) and [Republic of Estonia Road Administration](https://www.transpordiamet.ee/en/mobility-and-transportation/driving-licence-and-right-drive) for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Estonia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Estonia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Estonia should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories).  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/cuw.html?cq_ck=1707918026882#ExternalPopup), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/cuw.html?cq_ck=1707918026882#ExternalPopup).
