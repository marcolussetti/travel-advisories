# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

The Estonian legal system takes a zero-tolerance approach to driving under the influence and even one drink can lead to a DUI arrest and could immediately land you in jail.

In Estonia, everyone is required by law to wear small reflectors on clothing when it is dark outside.  Fines for refusing to wear the reflectors range from $50 to $500.

**Special Circumstances:**  Estonia is part of the Eurozone and only euros are accepted.

* Bank and currency exchange counters may refuse to accept U.S. currency that is crumpled, torn, discolored, or defaced.
* ATMs are widely available in Tallinn and in major towns.
* Contact [the Embassy of Estonia in Washington](https://washington.mfa.ee/) for specific information regarding customs requirements.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**  If you are arrested, you should ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Driving under the influence could land you immediately in jail.  In Estonia, the legal system takes a zero-tolerance approach, and even one drink can lead to a DUI arrest.
* Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.  You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Estonia. Estonian law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics, and the government generally respects these prohibitions. However, social acceptance of LGB identity in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  The law in Estonia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

* Estonia has few English language speaking medical interpreters, personal assistants, etc. as well as limited availability of specialized medical equipment.
