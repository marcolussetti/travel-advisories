# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, evenif you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the areaarrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start..

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/our-work) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://sn.usembassy.gov/services/) for further information.

**Currency**:Senegal’s currency is the franc of the Communauté Financière d'Afrique (fCFA), which has an exchange rate fixed to the Euro. Senegal’s economy operates primarily on a cash basis. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Although ATMs are available in some areas (primarily Dakar), they are not always reliable and should be used with caution. Mobile money services, using local cell phone accounts, are becoming more common. You may be able to transfer money from the United States using a commercial wire-transfer company.

**LGB Travelers**: Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Senegal. LGB individuals routinely face discrimination. Under Article 319 of the Senegalese criminal code, “unnatural acts” are punishable by imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of fCFA 1,000,000. Several arrests have occurred under these laws.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our[Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Special Circumstances**: While there are excellent relations between the approximately 95 percent of the Senegalese population that practices Islam and the remaining five percent that practice Christianity and other religions, Senegalese culture is conservative – particularly in rural regions. Be mindful of local social and cultural norms pertaining to dress, displays of affection, and interactions between men and women.

**Personal Identification**: Senegalese law requires all persons to carry valid personal identification at all times. U.S. citizens are encouraged to carry a passport or passport card with them at all times. Authorities may detain anyone, including U.S. citizens, who do not cooperate and provide identification. Senegalese authorities do not consider the certified copy of a passport or a U.S. driver’s license as identification.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Senegal prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

The availability of rental, repair, or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, and of service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city.

**Women Travelers**: Rape is a crime in Senegal, though it is rarely prosecuted. Spousal rape is not criminalized. Laws against domestic violence are rarely enforced.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is outlawed in Senegal but is commonly practiced in the south and southeast of the country.
