**Casamance region:** There are sporadic reports of armed banditry in the Casamance region of southern Senegal. Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote areas off main roads. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region.

**Crime:** Street crime, including robberies at knife-point and home burglaries, is common in Senegal, particularly in urban areas. Beware of pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and thieves on motorized scooters. Robberies occur regularly along the Corniche d’Ouest, an area heavily frequented by tourists and westerners.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Past demonstrations have turned violent.Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Senegal. See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams center around:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Offers of lucrative sales
* Offers of contracts with promises of large commissions
* Offers of free trips/luggage
* Lotteries
* Work permits/job offers
* U.S. visa opportunities

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the local police and the U.S. Embassy.

Report crimes to local police by dialing 17 (from within Senegal) or to the national police by dialing  +221 800-002-020. Contact the U.S. Embassy at +221 33-879-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Domestic Violence**: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Swimming**: A number of children drown each year in the Atlantic Ocean in Senegal. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast.

* Do not swim in the ocean if you are inexperienced in swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur.
* Do not dive into water of unknown depths.
* Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches.

**Tourism**:The tourism industry is not wellregulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerousareas/activities are not always labeledproperly. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities. If you are injured, you will likely need to seek appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.
