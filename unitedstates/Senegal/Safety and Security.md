# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Visit the [U.S. Embassy Dakar](https://sn.usembassy.gov/) website for current messages to U.S. citizens regarding safety and security.

**Casamance region:** There are sporadic reports of armed banditry in the Casamance region. Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote parts off main roads. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. While Senegal has not experienced any recent terrorist attacks, many places throughout West Africa, including Kayes Region of Mali on Senegal’s border, have witnessed such violence. More generally, terrorists increasingly have utilized less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, they seek out unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:** Street crime, including robberies at knife-point and home burglaries, is common in Senegal, particularly in urban areas. Beware of pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and thieves on motorized scooters. Robberies occur regularly along the Corniche d’Ouest, an area heavily frequented by tourists and westerners.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Senegal. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should contact the local police and the U.S. Embassy.

Report crimes to the local police at 17 or to the Gendarmerie at 800-00-20-20 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(221) 33-879-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Swimming:** An increasing number of children drown each year in the Atlantic Ocean in Senegal. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast.

* Do not swim in the ocean if you are inexperienced in swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur.
* Do not dive into water of unknown depths.
* Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access and provide urgent medical treatment areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
