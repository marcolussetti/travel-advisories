Several hospitals and clinics in Dakar can treat major and minor injuries and illnesses; however, medical facilities outside Dakar are extremely limited and unprepared to handle major injuries. There is inadequate inpatient psychiatric care and limited office-based psychiatric treatment in Dakar.

For emergency services in Senegal, dial 800-881-881 (Toll Free/Numero Vert) for SAMU.

Ambulance services are either unavailable or unreliable in most areas except Dakar, where ambulance services exist but can often arrive with great delay (up to 30-45 minutes). In the event an ambulance is not immediately available (the services will often provide an estimated time of arrival), injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals [here](https://sn.usembassy.gov/services/#local) under "local resources." We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Water Quality**

In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Wash raw vegetables and fruits in a bleach solution before eating.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Senegal. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst during the Harmattan winds in January and February, which frequently carry dust and sand particles from the Sahara and result in poor air quality throughout the country. People at greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Senegal.
