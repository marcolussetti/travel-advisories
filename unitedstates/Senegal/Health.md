Several hospitals and clinics in Dakar can treat major and minor injuries and illnesses; however, medical facilities outside Dakar are extremely limited and unprepared to handle major injuries. There is inadequate inpatient psychiatric care and limited office-based psychiatric treatment in Dakar.

For emergency services in Senegal, dial, +221 800-881-881 (Toll Free/Numero Vert) for SAMU.

Ambulance services are either unavailable or unreliable in most areas except Dakar, where ambulance services exist but can often arrive with great delay. In the event an ambulance is not immediately available (the services will often provide an estimated time of arrival), injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals on our webpage, under "[local resources](https://sn.usembassy.gov/services/)." We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) webpage for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Water Quality:** Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Wash raw vegetables and fruits in a bleach solution before eating.

**Air Quality:**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Senegal. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you, and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst during the Harmattan winds in January and February, which frequently carry dust and sand particles from the Sahara and result in poor air quality throughout the country. People at greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors
