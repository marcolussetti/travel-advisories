# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving is generally riskier and more challenging than in the United States. Drivers tend to exceed speed limits, follow other vehicles closely, ignore lane markings, and attempt to pass even when facing oncoming traffic. Roadways are poorly lit and poorly marked, and many sections have deteriorated surfaces. Due to limited street lighting, pedestrians are difficult to see at night. Drivers in both rural and urban areas may frequently expect to encounter and share the road with motorcycles, bicyclists, pedestrians, livestock, and animal carts. For information about automobile accidents in Senegal, visit the [U.S. Embassy Dakar](https://sn.usembassy.gov/) website.

While most main roads in Senegal are in relatively good condition for daytime driving, secondary roads are poor by U.S. standards. During the rainy season, many roads are passable only with four-wheel drive vehicles.

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic circulates on the right in Senegal. All drivers are expected to carry the following documents in their vehicles: (1) valid driver's license; (2) valid insurance papers; (3) vehicle registration/matriculation card ("carte grise"); (4) "vignette" tax disc for the current year; and (5) valid identification. Copies of U.S. passports must be clear enough to identify the driver of the vehicle.

**Public Transportation:** U.S. citizens should avoid using motorbikes, van taxis ("cars rapides"), and public transportation. Regulated orange-striped sedan auto taxis are safer, but make sure to agree on a fare before beginning the trip.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** There is direct commercial air service between the United States and Senegal. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the process of assessing the government of Senegal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards, and the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is assessing the implementation of ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for aviation security. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Senegal should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=ZH8vhpMLsRlhyYmGhsQmq712yBFWrSvYnnNWfPFbZHtddspH3KzQ!863626413!-1887722738?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).
