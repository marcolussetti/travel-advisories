**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving in Senegal is generally riskier and more challenging than in the United States. Drivers tend to exceed speed limits, follow other vehicles closely, ignore lane markings, and attempt to pass even when facing oncoming traffic. Roadways are poorly lit and poorly marked, and many have deteriorated surfaces. Due to limited street lighting, pedestrians are difficult to see at night. Drivers in both rural and urban areas may frequently expect to encounter and share the road with motorcycles, bicyclists, pedestrians, livestock, and animal carts. For information about automobile accidents in Senegal, visit the [U.S. Embassy Dakar](https://sn.usembassy.gov/) website.

While most main roads in Senegal are in relatively good condition for daytime driving, secondary roads are poor by U.S. standards. During the rainy season, many roads are passable only with four-wheel-drive vehicles.

**Traffic Laws:** Traffic circulates on the right in Senegal. All drivers are expected to carry the following documents in their vehicles:

* Valid driver's license
* Valid insurance papers
* Vehicle registration/matriculation card ("carte grise")
* "Vignette" tax disc for the current year
* Valid identification. Drivers should carry a valid U.S. passport or passport card.

**Public Transportation**: U.S. citizens should avoid using motorbikes, van taxis ("cars rapides"), and public transportation. Regulated orange-taxis are safer, but make sure to agree on a fare before beginning the trip. Travelers can download ride-share applications, such as “Heetch,” and pay the fixed fare in cash.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** There is direct commercial air service between the United States and Senegal. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Senegal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel**: Mariners planning travel to Senegal should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
