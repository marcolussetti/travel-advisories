***Updated to reflect new information on poliovirus and new recommendation in “If you decide to travel”* section.**

Exercise normal precautions in Senegal. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Exercise Increased Caution in:

* The Casamance region due to **crime** and **landmines**.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a [Level Two Health Notice for Senegal](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/senegal) following the **detection of poliovirus** in sewage water in the Dakar region.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/senegal.html) for additional information on travel to Senegal.

If you decide to travel to Senegal:

* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.
* Before any international travel, make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines. For most adults, complete primary series in childhood and a single lifetime booster dose if more than 10 years since completion of the primary series.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier for the U.S. Embassy to locate you in an emergency
* Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/) and [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/TravelGov).
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report) for Senegal.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html).

**Casamance Region – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**Bandits sporadically commit armed robbery in the Casamance region.

* Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern in the region.  Do not stray from main roads and well-traveled areas in the Casamance region.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region.  U.S. government employees are required to coordinate all travel to the area with security officials, and any travel off the main routes generally requires additional security measures (e.g., driving in a caravan of multiple vehicles, consulting local security officials, or carrying tracking locators).  U.S. government employees are also prohibited from travelling after dark anywhere in the Casamance region.
