**Road Conditions and Safety:**While Portugal has significantly expanded its motorway network with well-constructed roads that decreased the total number of accidents and fatalities, its road-accident fatality rate is still high. Use caution when driving, as aggressive driving habits and high speeds pose special hazards. Use appropriate care and caution while on the roadways, practice safe driving habits, and adhere to the applicable speed limits.

**Traffic Laws:**It is against the law to speed, drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or use a mobile phone while driving. Fines for traffic offenses are substantial.

* Seatbelts are mandatory for drivers and all passengers. Small children must be in a child safety seat in the rear seat with seatbelts fastened.
* Portuguese law requires you to leave your vehicle where it is and immediately notify the police when involved in a traffic accident. The national emergency phone number 112.
* Police in Portugal have the authority to fine on-the-spot and most of their vehicles have portable payment machines to facilitate immediate payment.
* You may drive with a valid U.S. driver's license for up to six months. For international driving permits, please contact AAA or the National Auto Club.

**Public Transportation:**Taxis and prominent ride-sharing services such as Uber are a reliable means of transportation. Refer to the crime section of this page to alert yourself to other threats related to taxis and ride-sharing services. Bus service is also reliable.

In the Azores, driving can be challenging due to narrow cobblestone streets, blind curves, blind corners, and livestock on country roads. Public buses are inexpensive. Bus services begin at 7 a.m. and generally operate until 8 p.m., depending on the destination.
