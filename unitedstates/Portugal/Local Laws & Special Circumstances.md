Furthermore, some U.S. laws allow criminal prosecution in the United States, regardless of where the crime was committed. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.
