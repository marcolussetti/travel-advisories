# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible near-term attacks in Europe. All European countries, including Portugal, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security.

**Crime:** Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at popular tourist sites, restaurants, and on public transportation, are common. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, such as the popular Tram 28, using the jostling of the crowd as a distraction. Avoid standing near the doors on public transportation, as thieves will often strike just as the train/bus doors open and then dash onto the platform and disappear into the crowd.

* Safeguard your passport and identity documents when traveling throughout Portugal. Foreigners who arrive in Portugal without a valid passport will not be permitted to enter and will be returned to their point of origin.
* Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe. Thefts of backpacks, electronics and luggage occur regularly. Do not leave valuables in rental cars, especially those with stickers identifying the vehicle as a rental car. Tourists are frequent victims of petty crime/car break-ins.
* Avoid using automatic teller machines (ATMs) in isolated or poorly lit areas. Use the buddy system and indoor bank ATMs when possible. Leave extra cash, credit cards, and personal documents at home or in a hotel safe.
* Keep doors and windows of private rentals locked at all times, taking extra care if easily accessed from the street or other places.
* Illicit drug transactions increase at night, and travelers are often approached by drug dealers in the downtown area of Lisbon, especially near the bars and restaurants. Some travelers have reported incidents in which criminals used drugs to assault or rob them. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs, and do not leave drinks unattended.
* Always use a taxi from the queue or kiosk. Do not go with someone who walks up to you and offers a ride. If you have called a ride sharing service such as Uber, confirm that the car information in the App matches the vehicle you are entering.
* Tourists should not leave personal items or valuables unattended while at the beach.
* Reports of thefts from rental homes and online rental apartments have increased.  Secure belongings and lock windows while away or sleeping.

**Demonstrations** occur in Portugal. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
