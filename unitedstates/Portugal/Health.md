**For emergency services in Portugal, dial 112.  Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.**

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

* Good medical care is available, but facilities may be limited outside urban areas. Public hospitals offer services at costs lower than private hospitals.
* Payment is expected upon admission at private hospitals.
* Call the national emergency response for an ambulance at 112 for life-threatening emergencies.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Government of Portugal](https://www.infarmed.pt/web/infarmed-en/about-infarmed) to ensure the medication is legal in Portugal. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Portuguese law prohibits the mailing of prescription medicines from the United States to Portugal. Any prescription medications mailed to Portugal will be impounded by the Portuguese customs office.

You should bring a sufficient supply of medication with you to cover your anticipated stay in Portugal, along with a copy of your physician's prescription. Portuguese pharmacies generally carry equivalent medications to those found in the United States; however, they may be sold under a different brand name, may not be available in the same dosage, or may require a prescription from a local doctor.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
