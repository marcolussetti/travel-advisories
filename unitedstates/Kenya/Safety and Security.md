# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

You should review the Department of State’s [Travel Advisory for Kenya](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/kenya-travel-advisory.html) before considering travel to Kenya.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using increasingly less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Terrorist threats remain high in Kenya. Terrorist attacks in Kenya have cumulatively resulted in the death and injury of hundreds of people, including foreigners. Attacks have occurred in periods leading up to and during religious holidays and days of national significance. However, an attack is possible at any time. Please note these recent events:

* In January 2020, terrorists attacked a U.S. Department of Defense facility on the coast, killing several individuals and destroying seven aircraft.
* In January 2019, a small bomb exploded in Nairobi’s Central Business District, slightly injuring two people.
* In January 2019, a terrorist attack on the Dusit D2 Hotel complex in the Westlands area of Nairobi resulted in the death of 21 people, including one U.S. citizen.
* In April 2019, two Cuban doctors were kidnapped from a rural area in Mandera County and were reportedly transported to Somalia.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Regions to Avoid**:

* The northeastern Kenyan counties of Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and the northeastern area of Marsabit (including the cities of El Wak, Wajir, Garissa, Mandera, Moyale, and Liboi).
* All parts of the coastal counties of Tana River and Lamu, and all areas of Kilifi County north of Malindi.
* The road between Kainuk and Lodwar in Turkana County due to banditry.
* The Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera.
* Avoid using the Likoni ferry due to safety and security concerns.

**Crime:** Crime in Kenya is a regular occurrence and Kenyan authorities have limited capacity to deter and investigate such acts.

* Violent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including home invasions, burglaries, armed carjackings, muggings, and kidnappings can occur at any time.
* “Matatus” (privately-operated public transportation buses) tend to be targeted since they carry multiple passengers.
* Cases of violent street crime targeting Westerners occur in many seemingly safe areas of Nairobi, ranging from simple muggings to kidnapping and extortion, including attacks during daylight hours. U.S. citizens using off-the-street taxis have also been victims of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion.

**Forced Marriage** is known to occur in Kenya.

**Female genital mutilation (FGM) and Cutting (C):** This act is known to occur in Kenya. It is a federal crime to perform FGM/C in the United States on any minor younger than 18 years old, punishable by fines and up to five years in prison. It is also a criminal offense knowingly to take a minor younger than 18 years old outside of the United States for the purpose of performing FGM/C (so-called “vacation cutting”).

**Sexual Assault** is prevalent in Kenya and frequently goes unreported.

* Victims of sexual assault may have difficulty receiving **adequate social or medical support**.
* Whilesexual assault is mostly frequently associated with women, **sexual assault of men** also occurs in Kenya and often goes unreported because of the stigma attached to this type of assault.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Kenya. Scams are often initiated through dating apps, internet postings/profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters.

Common scams include:

* Romance and online dating (Check this online dating scam [infographic](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0560-online-dating-scams-infographic?utm_source=partner-pitch&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=aba-online-dating)).
* Someone you have not met in person quickly offers friendship, romance, and/or marriage.
* Job solicitations asking for a processing fee in advance.
* A person asking for money to pay hospital bills, visa fees, or legal expenses and/or seeming to have many sudden problems overseas.
* Elaborate scam business opportunities, including fraudulent government procurements. Recently, scammers have been impersonating legitimate companies and ordering commodities shipped through Mombasa with payment terms. Companies are encouraged to independently verify the purchasing company to confirm the order prior to shipping goods without pre-payment. Please contact the Commercial Section at [Office.Nairobi@trade.gov](mailto:Office.Nairobi@trade.gov) for assistance verifying procurement opportunities and Kenyan buyers.
* Use good judgement and caution on social media and dating websites. If you decide to meet someone in person that you have connected with online, be sure to set up the meeting in a safe and public place, and let someone know where you are.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police at 999, 112 or 911, and contact the U.S. Embassy during business hours at +254 (0) 20-363-6451, or after-hours at +254 (0) 20-363-6000.

Kenya has assistance programs for victims of crime sponsored by nongovernmental organizations. These programs include but are not limited to the following:

* [Gender Violence Recovery Centre (GVRC) Gender Violence Recovery Centre (GVRC)](http://gvrc.or.ke/) has been providing specialized medical treatment and psychosocial support to low-income survivors of sexual and domestic violence.
* [Healthcare Assistance Kenya (HAK)](https://hakgbv1195.org/) offers a 24-hour Rapid Response Service to women and children survivors of Gender Based Violence at its Call Centre as well as a 24 hour toll-free hotline for sexual and gender based violence assistance.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The Kenyan Tourism Regulatory Authority has oversight for the country’s tourism sector. The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities vary by region. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Game parks and related safari tours with well-established operators generally have been reported to be safe.
