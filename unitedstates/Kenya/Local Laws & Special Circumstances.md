# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Possession of any amount of ammunition can incur a minimum seven-year sentence.
* Penalties for **possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs** in Kenya are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Kenya enacted strict legislation regulating the sale and consumption of alcohol and cigarettes.
* Penalties for possessing banned wildlife items under Kenya’s Wildlife Act include large fines and severe penalties, including life imprisonment.
* Violations of the Kenya Firearms Act are punishable from one year to life imprisonment.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Customs regulations** are strict with regard to importing certain items into or out of Kenya such as antiquities, medications, business equipment, currency, ivory, rhino horn, and other wildlife products including hides, skins, and teeth.

U.S. citizens have been detained and arrested for attempting to bring contraband into Kenya. Contact the [Embassy of Kenya](https://www.kenyaembassydc.org/) or one of Kenya’s consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Importation of Healthcare Products:** Non-compliant healthcare products are subject to seizure. Importers of these items may face criminal and civil penalties. Travelers who import healthcare products must follow the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Act and related laws. The government of Kenya mandates specific requirements, such as temperature and humidity monitoring, import/export authorization permits, and advance notification for certain consignments.

Regulated items include:

* Sample and donated consignments;
* Medicines, including those for personal use;
* Body parts for transplants and scientific purposes;
* Finished pharmaceuticals and chemical products; and
* Vaccines and medical devices.

The importation of expired products is strictly prohibited. The government of Kenya requires products to possess at least two-thirds of their original shelf life (i.e., time between the manufactured date and the expiration date) at the time of importation.  All products require market authorization from the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board for legal importation.

Questions and applications for import authorizations should be directed to the Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board at [info@ppb.go.ke](mailto:info@ppb.go.ke) or [drug\_reg@ppb.go.ke](mailto:drug_reg@ppb.go.ke).

**Alcoholic Drinks Control** Act of 2010, which regulates when and where alcoholic drinks may be consumed in public, states that a person found by local law enforcement authorities to be intoxicated or disorderly in or near public areas, including some businesses, may be arrested without warrant and brought to court for trial.

* If convicted, the maximum fine is 500 Kenyan shillings and/or imprisonment for a maximum of three months.
* If convicted three times of the same charge within a 12-month period, you will be required to participate in mandatory rehabilitation at your expense.

More information on this law may be found on [Kenya's substance abuse website, NACADA.](http://nacada.go.ke/)

**Tobacco Control Act** 2007 regulates public smoking and the marketing and sale of tobacco products in Kenya. In public places, smoking is allowed only in designated smoking areas.

**Currency:** You may depart the country with up to 100,000 Kenyan shillings.

* Destruction of Kenyan currency, even in small amounts, is illegal, and almost always results in arrest and a fine.
* You should ensure that your U.S. currency bills are relatively new, as banks in Kenya have been known not to accept older U.S. currency.

**Cultural Rehabilitation Centers:** Some schools and other facilities acting as cultural rehabilitation centers are operating in Kenya with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their will and being physically, sexually, and emotionally abused are common. U.S. citizens are encouraged to thoroughly research these facilities and talk to others who have used them. They should have a plan for an early return if necessary.

**Safaris**: [Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)](https://www.kws.go.ke/), the governing body of Kenya’s national parks, requires all tour operators and safari lodges carry nationally mandated insurance. You should:

* Inquire whether prospective safari camps or tour operators are in compliance with this requirement;
* Observe all local or park regulations and exercise appropriate caution in unfamiliar surroundings; and
* Thoroughly check the qualifications and safety record of all tourist lodges and guides before engaging their services and venturing into the wild in their care.

**Firearms:** Import, possession, and use of firearms is governed by the Kenya Firearms Act.

* Import of all firearms, including sporting guns, is prohibited in Kenya except in accordance with the terms of an import permit.
* Possession of firearms while in Kenya requires a firearms certificate, which can be difficult to obtain.
* Violations of the Kenya Firearms Act are punishable from one year to life imprisonment. Possession of any amount of ammunition is punishable by a minimum seven-year sentence.

**LGB Travelers:** Kenyan law criminalizes same-sex sexual activity. The Kenyan penal code criminalizes “carnal knowledge against the order of nature,” which is interpreted to prohibit consensual same-sex sexual activity and specifies a maximum penalty of 14 years of imprisonment. A separate statute specifically criminalizes sex between men and specifies a maximum penalty of 21 years of imprisonment. Police have detained persons under these laws, particularly suspected sex workers. LGB advocacy organizations, such as the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, have been permitted to register and conduct activities. However, societal discrimination based on sexual orientation is widespread.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:**  See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Kenyan law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. The Government of Kenya has not consistently enforced these provisions and implementation has been slow.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure.

* **Access to government or private buildings**, medical facilities, restaurants, or other public or private facilities is limited.
* Accessibility to **public transportation** and taxis is limited. There is no functioning bus system in Nairobi, but rather an extensive use of vans (“matatus”) that travel along designated routes; taxis are also used, as are motorcycles serving as taxis (“boda bodas”).
* **Public transportation** and taxis do not accommodate wheelchairs; these vehicles are most often hailed from the side of busy roads.
* **Footpaths** along the side of roads are generally unpaved, bumpy, dirt paths, and road crossings are often unmarked.
