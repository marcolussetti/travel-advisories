# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road accidents are a major threat to travelers in Kenya. Roads are poorly maintained and are often bumpy, potholed, and unpaved.

* Traffic moves on the left side of the road, which can be very disorienting to those not accustomed to it.
* Beware of vehicles traveling at excessive speed, and unpredictable local driving habits.
* Many vehicles are poorly maintained and lack basic safety equipment.
* Heavy traffic jams, either due to rush hour or because of accidents, are common.
* Some vehicles will cross the median strip and drive against the flow of traffic.

U.S. citizens have been fatally injured in accidents involving long-distance, inter-city buses and local buses and vans called “matatus”. **Matatus are commonly known to be the greatest danger to other vehicles and pedestrians.** U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using matatus.

Injuries and fatalities involving two-wheeled motorcycle taxis, called “boda bodas,” are equally common. **Boda bodas** often fail to observe basic safety precautions and ignore traffic rules. Inter-city nighttime road travel should be avoided due to the poor road and streetlight conditions and the threat of banditry throughout the country. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using boda bodas.

During the rainy season, some **unpaved roads are impassable** even with four-wheel drive vehicles with high clearance. Travelers are urged to consult with local officials regarding road conditions.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Trains**: Most passenger trains are considered unsafe, particularly during rainy seasons, because of the lack of routine maintenance and safety checks. The only approved train route for U.S. government personnel is the Nairobi to Mombasa Standard Gauge Railway. U.S. government personnel can only ride in the first-class cabin to avoid pickpockets and facilitate a rapid exit if necessary.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Kenya’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Kenya’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Kenya should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
