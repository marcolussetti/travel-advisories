[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Medical treatment is generally good on the major islands, but is limited in more remote or less populated areas. In less populated areas where there are no hospitals, medical assistance can be found at a Dispensaire, a French government-run free clinic. Patients with emergencies or serious illnesses are often referred to facilities on Tahiti for treatment. In emergencies, evacuation by air to Papeete may be required. For medical emergencies in French Polynesia, dial 15 for an ambulance.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tuvalu) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medication:** If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [French Polynesia](https://www.polynesie-francaise.pref.gouv.fr/)to ensure the medication is legal in French Polynesia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/FrenchPolynesia.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Travelers should consider being vaccinated for hepatitis A and typhoid, which can be transmitted through contaminated food and water.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
