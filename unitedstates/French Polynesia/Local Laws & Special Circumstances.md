# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Please ensure that items you purchase in French Polynesia are not pirated or counterfeit. Purchasing or owning these items may have legal consequences in French Polynesia or the United States.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/)for further information.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance***.*While in French Polynesia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation different from what you find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of other state services. The French Polynesian government generally enforces these provisions effectively.

French Polynesia subscribes to laws that require disability accommodations, and many new buildings with public or community space are accessible. Many existing buildings as well as transportation systems do not yet meet these requirements. Accessibility is a requirement, however, for new construction.
