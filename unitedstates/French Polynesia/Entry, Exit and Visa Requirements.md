# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. citizens do not need a visa if entering on a regular tourist passport and staying no more than 90 days out of every six months. If the purpose of the trip is not tourism (work, scientific research, etc.), then you may be required to obtain a visa before arrival in French Polynesia. If traveling as a tourist, you must be in possession of a return ticket. The 12-page U.S. emergency passport is not valid for visa-free entry into France.

For further information about entry requirements, particularly if entering by sea, contact the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the French Embassy at 4101 Reservoir Road NW, Washington, DC 20007, telephone 202-944-6200, fax 202-944-6212, or visit the [Embassy of France's web site](https://franceintheus.org/).

**Travelers with HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of French Polynesia.
