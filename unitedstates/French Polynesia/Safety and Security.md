[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Public Safety:** Protests and strikes periodically occur and can sometimes be violent. Messages regarding possible social unrest, and natural disasters are posted on the [embassy’s website](https://fj.usembassy.gov/category/alert/).

**Crime:** Although French Polynesia has a low crime rate, petty crime, such as pick pocketing and purse snatching, does occur. You should secure your valuables at all times and remain particularly vigilant at night. Make sure you lock your doors and secure your windows.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
