# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions in French Polynesia are different than in the United States. While most major roads are paved, many secondary roads are not. In urban areas, traffic is brisk and vehicles and pedestrians jockey for space on narrow streets. Tourists should exercise caution when driving, particularly at night. While extensive sections of the road circumnavigating the island of Tahiti have streetlights, many side streets do not.

Tourists who rent bicycles or mopeds should take extra precautions to avoid collisions, even on roads with little traffic. At night, beware of bicycles operating without proper lights.

**Traffic Laws:**Crosswalks are marked, and the law requires that motor vehicles stop for pedestrians; however, this law is not always followed in practice. Driving while intoxicated is illegal. Use of a mobile phone while driving is also illegal.

**Public Transportation:**Maintain control of your personal belongings on public transportation such as buses and ferries. Be aware of the possibility of pickpocketing.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of French Polynesia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of French Polynesia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to French Polynesia should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
