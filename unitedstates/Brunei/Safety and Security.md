**Crime**: Most crimes that occur in Brunei are non-violent crimes of opportunity, including residential burglaries and vehicle break-ins.

While in Brunei, you can generally avoid becoming a victim of a crime of opportunity by practicing good security awareness. For example:

* avoid secluded locations,
* properly secure your residence and vehicle, and
* do not travel alone late at night.

Crime in Brunei peaks in July and December, due to the holidays and schools being out of session.
