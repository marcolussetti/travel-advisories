[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Brunei has an extensive network of roads comparable to those in most western countries, and they are well maintained.

* Traffic moves on the left side of the road.
* Holders of a foreign driver’s license are permitted to drive in Brunei Darussalam for 90 days only.
* For longer stays, a foreign driver’s license must be endorsed to a Brunei driver’s license, available at any [Land Transport Department office.](https://www.jpd.gov.bn/Theme/Home.aspx)

**Traffic Laws**: Review the Brunei [Land Transport Department](https://www.jpd.gov.bn/Theme/Home.aspx) office website for information.

* Drivers must always obey traffic rules and should take extra caution when approaching traffic signals.
* The Royal Brunei Police Force routinely sets up checkpoints and traffic stops, particularly at night, for license and registration checks, sobriety assessments, and contraband searches.
* If you are stopped by police, you will need to show your identification card, vehicle registration, and insurance card.

**Public Transportation:** There are six bus routes servicing the Bandar Seri Begawan area. Normal operating hours are from 6:00 a.m.-8:00 p.m. daily. Bus fares start from B$1.00. Buses heading to other towns in Brunei such as Tutong, Kuala Belait, and Seria depart from the bus stops located at Jalan Kianggeh (opposite the Chinese temple) and Jalan McArthur (along waterfront) in Bandar Seri Begawan.

Taxis can be found at the airport, hotels, shopping centers, and the central bus station in Bandar Seri Begawan and are metered. You should use licensed, metered taxis or car services provided by hotels in Brunei. Car services through ridesharing apps have gained popularity both for convenience and fare transparency.
