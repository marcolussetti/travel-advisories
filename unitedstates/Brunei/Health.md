**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most private care providers in Brunei accept major credit cards or cash payments, and some may accept local bank transfers. Public care providers only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medication/Prescriptions**:

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Embassy of Brunei](http://www.bruneiembassy.org/) in Washington, DC, to ensure the medication is legal in Brunei.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

Marijuana for medical use, even with a prescription, is not legal in Brunei.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:**  Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
