# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

U.S. passport holders must have at least six months’ validity remaining on their passport before entering Brunei for business or pleasure. All travelers are required to obtain an [E-Arrival Card registration](https://www.imm.gov.bn/) approval before arrival to Brunei by air, land, and sea. The online E-Arrival Card registration is separate from visa requirements. No payment is required for the registration. Transit travelers are exempted from this requirement. Visits longer than 90 days require a visa. Travelers who apply for visas are required to have at least six blank passport pages. Travelers are also required to complete the Health Declaration through the Bruhealth mobile application, or <https://www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel> before arrival. For further information about entry or exit requirements, travelers may consult the Consular Section of the Embassy of Brunei, 3520 International Court NW, Washington, DC 20008, tel. (202) 237-1838, or visit the [Embassy of Brunei website](http://www.bruneiembassy.org/)for the most current visa information.

**Immigration Violations:** Immigration offenses, including overstay of your visa, are punishable by jail sentence, fines, and caning. Individuals associated with violators, such as contractors or employers, are subject to the same penalties if the violator is found guilty.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions**: Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Brunei. Visitors entering Brunei for employment purposes who have HIV/AIDS are first required to undergo a medical examination. The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Brunei Darussalam requires all travelers entering Brunei to fill out a Health Declaration Card and submit it to the Officer-In-Charge (MOH) upon disembarkation. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Brunei](http://www.bruneiembassy.org/)before you travel.

You may be subjected to a medical examination upon arrival in Brunei Darussalam. Travelers may be quarantined if infected or suspected to be infected with an infectious disease or if travelers have had contact with such a person.
