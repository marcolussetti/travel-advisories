# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start. Brunei’s civil penal code and Sharia Penal Code (commonly known as “the sharia law”) operate in parallel. Both include provisions for corporal and capital punishment.

Criminal penalties for some offenses are harsher than in the United States. This includes some acts that are not crimes in the United States. Under the Sharia Penal Code, punishments for certain crimes may include amputation of hands or feet and death by stoning. The Sharia Penal Code applies regardless of an individual’s religion or nationality. However, some sections of the law have specific applicability to Muslims.

Brunei adheres to conservative Islamic social values; U.S. citizens are advised to learn and respect local customs and traditions. You should consult a guidebook or other travel information on Brunei for more information about respecting local cultural norms.

Any public criticism of the Sultan or other members of the royal family, Sharia Penal Code, or Islam is illegal and punishable under Bruneian law.

Under Brunei’s Sharia Penal Code, consuming any food, drink, or tobacco in public during the fasting hours of Ramadan is a crime.

Gambling is illegal in Brunei.

Prostitution and pornography are illegal and can result in harsh punishments.

Non-Muslims may be arrested for khalwat (close proximity between the sexes) under the Sharia Penal Code if the other accused party is Muslim. Khalwat may include activities from holding hands or public displays of affection to sexual activity. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are subject to khalwat and zina (fornication or adultery) laws.

Extramarital sexual relations between a Muslim and non-Muslim are a crime in Brunei. Violations may lead to severe punishment.

Alcohol cannot be purchased legally in Brunei. However, two liters of spirits/wine and 12 cans of beer (one can=330ml) may be imported by non-Muslim adults for personal consumption in private. You must declare your alcohol to customs upon arrival.

Importation of firearms and ammunition is prohibited. The illegal possession, use, distribution, and/or sale of firearms, ammunition, and/or explosives may carry severe penalties, including the death penalty.

Illegal possession, use, distribution, and/or sale of drugs may carry severe penalties. Penalties may include the death penalty.

Both medical and recreational use of marijuana is illegal in Brunei. Drug use/possession carry severe penalties.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

The Royal Brunei Police Force is generally professional and courteous. Most officers speak English. However, some, especially from the reserve units, have limited-to-no English-speaking capability.

You should carry a copy of your passport with you as you will need to produce proof of your identity should an incident occur.

**Dual Nationality:** Brunei does not recognize or permit dual nationality. Brunei nationals are expected to enter and exit the country on their Brunei passports. Should Bruneian authorities learn that a person is a dual national, they may require immediate renunciation of the citizenship of either the other nation or Brunei.

**Customs Regulations:** Bruneian customs authorities enforce strict import/export regulations. Contact the [Embassy of Brunei](http://www.bruneiembassy.org/) in Washington, DC, for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.
