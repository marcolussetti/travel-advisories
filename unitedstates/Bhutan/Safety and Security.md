# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** There is relatively little crime in Bhutan. Take reasonable precautions when visiting major towns. This is especially true when going out at night.

* Petty crime, like pickpocketing and purse snatching, is occasionally reported.
* Burglaries, theft, robbery, stolen vehicles, and assault related to skin color, ethnic origin, and religion have increased in recent years.
* Police report increased arrests related to drug/alcohol abuse and marijuana.
* Police report an increase in reported rape cases.
* Tobacco sale is unlawful. Foreigners caught selling tobacco to Bhutanese can be charged with smuggling. Authorities will seize the tobacco and treat it as contraband.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.
