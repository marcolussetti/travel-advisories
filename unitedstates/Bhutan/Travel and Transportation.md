# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

Roads outside cities are in poor condition. Emergency services are generally unavailable. The terrain is mountainous. Roads have steep drop-offs and blind curves.

During heavy rains, falling rocks and landslides can block roads.  
Please refer to the [Tourism Council for Bhutan](https://bhutan.travel/), [Bhutan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs](http://mosic.moea.gov.bt/mosic/defaulthomepage.do) and our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

* No Bhutanese carriers offer commercial air service from Bhutan to the United States. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Bhutan's Civil Aviation Authority. They have not assessed it for compliance with the safety standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). You can find further information on the FAA’s Safety Assessment Page.
* Flights into and out of Paro Airport are restricted to daylight hours. They depend on the weather.
* Weather can delay or cancel flights. This is especially true in the monsoon season from May to September.
* Passengers should allow at least 24 hours for connecting flights to and from Paro Airport. They should use non-restricted air tickets. That way, the airline can rebook them on the first available flight if they miss a connection.
* Passengers transiting through India will need a transit visa if they intend to leave the airport or spend a night in India.
