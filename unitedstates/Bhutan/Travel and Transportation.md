[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

If you travel outside major cities in Bhutan, be aware of the road conditions and accessibility:

* Roads outside cities are in poor condition
* Emergency services are generally unavailable.
* The terrain is mountainous.
* Roads have steep drop-offs and blind curves.
* During heavy rains, falling rocks and landslides can block roads.

Please refer to the [Tourism Council for Bhutan](https://bhutan.travel/), [Bhutan's Ministry of Economic Affairs](http://mosic.moea.gov.bt/mosic/defaulthomepage.do), and our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

* No Bhutanese carriers offer commercial air service from Bhutan to the United States.
* The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Bhutan's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAAâ€™s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.
* Flights into and out of Paro Airport are restricted to daylight hours. They depend on the weather.
* Weather can delay or cancel flights. This is especially true in the monsoon season from May to September.
* Passengers should allow at least 24 hours for connecting flights to and from Paro Airport. They should use non-restricted air tickets. That way, the airline can rebook them on the first available flight if they miss a connection.

Passengers transiting through India will need a transit visa if they intend to leave the airport or spend a night in India.
