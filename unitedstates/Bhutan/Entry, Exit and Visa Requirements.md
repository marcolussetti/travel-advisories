The Government of Bhutan may require travelers to show a COVID-19 negative certificate to enter the country. Please visit the [Government of Bhutan website](https://www.doi.gov.bt/?p=1908&lang=en) for more information.

The Department of Tourism sets a $100 per person, per night fee for sustainable development. It is non-negotiable and applies to all visitors to Bhutan. Children aged 6 to 12 pay a discounted fee of $50 per person, per night. Children under age 6 do not have to pay the fee.

* Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months past the date of your arrival to Bhutan.
* All visitors, including those on U.S. government business, must get a Bhutanese visa to enter and leave Bhutan. It may take up to 5 days to process a correctly filed visa application, and you cannot buy airplane tickets to Bhutan without visa clearance.
* You may apply for the visa on the [Bhutanese Department of Immigration website](https://visit.doi.gov.bt/). The visa fee is $40.
* Bhutan no longer requires visitors to book travel to or within Bhutan through an accredited tour operator. But the Department of Tourism still recommends them for their expert knowledge and customer service, and travelers seeking to visit sites outside of Paro or Thimphu are required to be accompanied by an accredited guide. You can find more information, including a list of authorized tour operators, through this [link](https://services.bhutan.travel/) on the [official Bhutan travel website](https://bhutan.travel/).
