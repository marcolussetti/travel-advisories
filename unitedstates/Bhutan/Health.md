The Government of Bhutan may require travelers entering the country to produce a COVID-19 negative certificate. Please visit the [Government of Bhutan website](https://www.doi.gov.bt/?p=1908&lang=en) for more information.  
  
For emergency services in Bhutan, dial 113.  
  
Ambulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except the capital city, Thimphu.  
  
Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.  
  
**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.  
  
We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.  
  
Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Bhutan Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.bt/) to ensure the medication is legal in Bhutan.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Government of Bhutan recommends that visitors obtain tetanus, typhoid, and hepatitis A inoculations before traveling to Bhutan. Hepatitis B, Japanese Encephalitis, and rabies vaccines are recommended for prolonged stays for people at risk. The influenza vaccine is also recommended.

[The Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan](https://www.ricb.bt/) has initiated a travel and medical plan solely for visitors to Bhutan. When booking your trip, you should get detailed information about the insurance plan from your travel agents in Bhutan.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.  
  
The U.S. Embassy does not maintain a list of doctors and hospitals in Bhutan. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Health facilities are in populated areas in Bhutan such as Thimphu and Paro. But health care in rural areas is below U.S. standards or unavailable. Medical care is not up to Western standards throughout the country. For serious conditions, hospital facilities in Bhutan should only be used for stabilization prior to transfer to an evacuation site such as Singapore or Bangkok.
* **U.S. citizens in need of urgent medical care should try to get to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital in the capital city, Thimphu. For emergency services in Thimphu, dial 113 for police or 112 for ambulance.**
* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often need payment “up front” before service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals need cash payment.
* Travelers should make efforts to get complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.
* Be aware that some hotels or resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers. These agreements may limit your choices in seeking emergency care.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, only a few staff are available overnight in non-emergency wards of public hospitals. Consider hiring a private nurse. Or, have family spend the night with the patient. This is especially important for a minor child.
* Patients pay all the costs for going to a hospital or moving between them.
* Even in big cities, there is a limited availability of psychological and psychiatric services. Hospital care of this type is only available through the government.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often available for sale with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common. It may not work. It may be the wrong strength. Or, it may have dangerous ingredients. Consult with a medical professional and buy medication from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Water Quality:** In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and drinks are generally safe. But many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled water. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:** Many parts of Bhutan are at high altitude. Visitors planning to trek in Bhutan should pay special attention to the risk of altitude illness. Altitude sickness is a risk above 8,000 feet. Travelers to that height should ask a health care provider 4 to 6 weeks before their trip.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).

**Adventure Travel:**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [adventure travel.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure)
* We strongly encourage you to make sure your medical insurance covers evacuations. They can be very expensive.
* Treks in Bhutan can take visitors days or weeks away from the nearest medical facility. Limited helicopter evacuation from remote areas in Bhutan is available at the U.S. citizen’s expense.

**General Health Language**

* All travelers should use the CDC-recommended mosquito repellents, even on short stays. Also, sleep under nets with insecticide.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) about specific issues in Bhutan.
