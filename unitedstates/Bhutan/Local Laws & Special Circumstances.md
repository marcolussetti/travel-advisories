# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. You may face expulsion, arrest, or imprisonment if you violate local laws, even unknowingly. Penalties for having, using, or selling illegal drugs in Bhutan are severe. They include long jail sentences and heavy fines, or death. You may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings. People starting a business or practicing a regulated profession should seek information from local authorities. They should do this before practicing or operating.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to tell the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India, right away. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**LGB Travelers:** The constitution provides for equal protection and application of rights but neither the constitution nor legislation explicitly protects individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. Members of the LGB community reported instances of discrimination and social stigma based on sexual orientation.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Bhutan does not specifically prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:** If you are a woman traveling abroad, please see our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Currency Issues:** Visitors are advised to carry cash. Although credit cards are becoming more widely accepted in Bhutan, many hotels and shops often experience system outages and cannot accept credit cards.

Indian rupees are usually accepted for purchases in Bhutan, although most shopkeepers and businesses may not accept Indian rupees in denominations above 100. A limited number of ATMs are available in Bhutan’s main cities.

**Customs:** Bhutanese customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Bhutan of items such as firearms, ammunition, explosives and military supplies; narcotics and drugs (except medically prescribed drugs); tobacco products; wildlife products, especially those of endangered species; and antiques.

It is advisable to contact the [Bhutan Mission to the United Nations](https://www.mfa.gov.bt/pmbny/) (Consulate General), 343 East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017, telephone (212) 682-2268, fax (212) 661-0551, for specific information regarding customs requirements.
