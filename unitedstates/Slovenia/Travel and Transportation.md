**Road Conditions and Safety:** Slovenia has a well-developed, connected, and clearly marked road network with road signs and traffic rules consistent with those used throughout Europe.

* Be alert to aggressive drivers both in cities and on highways. Many serious, high-speed accidents occur in Slovenia.
* If you are involved in an accident, you should contact the police by dialing 113.
  + If anyone is injured, an ambulance can be reached by dialing 112.
  + Police routinely conduct breathalyzer tests on all drivers involved in accidents, regardless of whom they suspect is at fault. If major damage has occurred, do not move your vehicle. The police will wish to survey the accident scene. Obtain the name, contact information, and insurance information from the other driver(s) involved in the accident.
  + Complete the blank [European accident form](https://cartraveldocs.com/), which are mandatory for drivers to carry with them in their vehicle.
* If your car breaks down, call 1987 for roadside assistance and towing.
* Obtain English traffic and road conditions from the [Automobile Association of Slovenia](https://www.amzs.si/), [Traffic Information Center for Public Roads](http://www.promet.si/portal/en/1traffic-conditions.aspx), or by calling (01) 530-5300.

**Traffic Laws:** Third-party liability insurance is required for all vehicles and can be purchased locally. Travelers driving rented automobiles from Croatia into Slovenia are generally able to purchase Slovenian insurance at the border.

* Using hand-held phones while driving is illegal.
* Turning right on red is illegal. You must have a valid U.S. driver’s license and an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive. After one year, you must get a Slovenian driver’s license. [The American Automobile Association](https://cluballiance.aaa.com/?zip=22202&stateprov=va&city=arlington&devicecd=PC) and the [American Automobile Touring Alliance](https://aataidp.com/) issue IDPs.
* Highway vignettes are required for all passenger vehicles and motorcycles using highways. A vignette is a system of paying toll roads in several countries across Europe. The system requires drivers to purchase and display a sticker or an electronic equivalent on their vehicle to use certain roads or highways. Steep fines for driving without a vignette are one of the most common problems faced by U.S. citizens in Slovenia. You may purchase a vignette in-country at most major gas stations, or buy one [online](https://evinjeta.dars.si/en) before you start driving on highways in Slovenia. If driving into Slovenia from neighboring countries, you can also buy your vignette at a gas station before reaching the border.
* If you are stopped for not having a vignette, or for a moving violation, you may have the opportunity to pay a reduced fine on the spot. If you choose not to, the police may confiscate your passport until you pay the fine.
* **Do not drink and drive**. The maximum legal blood-alcohol limit is .05%. The limit is .00% for drivers with less than two years’ experience, drivers under 21, and truck or bus drivers.
* Headlight (day and night), seatbelt, and helmet (on motorcycles) use is mandatory. In addition, in your car you must carry:
  + a first-aid kit
  + spare headlight bulbs
  + a warning triangle
  + reflective vest/jacket

* blank [European accident form](https://cartraveldocs.com/) (to complete in the event of an accident)
* Bicycles are very common on Slovenian roads and drivers must yield to them.
* Between November 15 and March 15, all cars must have winter or appropriate all-season tires. Police may require chains in heavy snow.

**Public Transportation:** Trains and buses are available between cities, and buses provide reliable service within cities such as Ljubljana.

**Taxis:** While taxis are generally safe and reliable, first ask for an estimated fare and make sure the meter is running during the journey.

**Bicycling:** Cities have well-developed bicycling networks with marked bicycle lanes along most roads and [many rules governing cycling](https://www.policija.si/eng/prevention/traffic-safety/bicycle-safety). Visit the websites of [Slovenia's national tourist office](http://www.slovenia.info/) and the [Slovenian Roads Agency](https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/bodies-within-ministries/slovenian-infrastructure-agency/) for more information on bicycling laws in Slovenia.

See State Department’s [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information on driving abroad.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Slovenia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Slovenia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Slovenia should check for [U.S. maritime advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories?field_msci_geographic_location_target_id=Europe&field_msci_effective_date_value%5Bmin%5D=&field_msci_effective_date_value%5Bmax%5D=&keys=) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).
