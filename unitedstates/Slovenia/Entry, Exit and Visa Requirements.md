# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

* U.S. citizens must have a valid passport to enter Slovenia, but do not require a visa for tourist or routine business travel of less than 90 days. Note: The 90 day visa-free time-frame starts as soon as you enter the Schengen Zone – an area made up of a number of European countries including Slovenia, Austria, Hungary and Italy, among others. Travelers can stay up to a cumulative 90 days within the period of the immediately preceding 180 days. That means if a traveler stays for 90 days, they will need to be outside of the Schengen zone for 180 days to reset the clock. Remaining in Slovenia or the Schengen Area beyond 90 days without a residency permit may incur large fines, deportation, criminal charges, and/or travel restrictions.
* If you wish to stay in Slovenia for longer than 90 days, you will require a [long stay “D” visa](https://www.gov.si/en/representations/embassy-washington/) or a [residence permit](https://si.usembassy.gov/slovenian-residence-citizenship/). Applying for residency is time consuming. U.S. citizens must submit an FBI criminal records certificate less than three months old apostilled by the Department of State as part of the residency application.
* Foreigners must carry official identification at all times (U.S. passport or a Slovenian residence card).
* You must obtain a stamp in your passport upon entering the Schengen Area and show it when departing.
* Non-EU citizens staying longer than three days must register with the police within 72 hours of arrival. Hotels and apartments or houses rented through a company will register you. In all other cases, you must register yourself at a police station. Failure to register can result in hefty fines.
