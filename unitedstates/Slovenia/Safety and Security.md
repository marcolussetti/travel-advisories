# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Slovenia’s overall crime rate is low. Incidents of purse snatching and pickpocketing are most common in tourist areas, with robberies and acts of vandalism reported in Ljubljana primarily late at night.

* Use common sense, avoid isolated areas after dark, take security precautions, and report any incidents to the local police.
* Residential break-ins occur, particularly in Ljubljana. Residences left unattended for extended periods with poor security measures are most vulnerable.
* Vehicle break-ins and thefts also occur. Always lock your vehicles, use vehicle anti-theft devices, and park in well-lit areas or in residential or hotel garages. Bicycle theft is disproportionately high compared to similar cities. Make sure your bicycles are secured before leaving them in a bicycle rack or bike park.
* Exercise caution at so-called "gentlemen's clubs." Such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bar bills and threatened those who refuse to pay.
* U.S. citizens have reported sexual assaults in at least one nightclub in recent years. Use caution when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs and do not leave your drinks unattended.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Demonstrations:** There are occasional strikes, protests, and other public demonstrations in Slovenia. Protests in Ljubljana are usually held in areas around Kongresni Trg (Congress Square), opposite the Slovenian Parliament, in other locations in central Ljubljana, and sometimes near the U.S. Embassy. Some participants have occasionally expressed anti-U.S. sentiments. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.

* Be vigilant near crowded venues.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.For additional information, check the [Embassy’s website.](https://si.usembassy.gov/category/alert/)

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 113. For medical emergencies, dial 112. Contact the U.S. Embassy by calling +386-1-200-5500. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.

Outdoor adventure sports are increasingly popular with tourists in Slovenia. Such activities involve inherent risk. Travelers are encouraged to be mindful of their own personal limitations as well as accessibility and connectivity issues that might hinder emergency response. Many of the mountain rescues in Slovenia involve foreign nationals who were unprepared. We recommend you: never hike alone, never hike or climb without proper footwear and protective equipment, prepare for altitude sickness, drink sufficient water, and remain on marked trails. Avoid dangerous or fast-moving rivers, and be wary of poisonous snakes. If you are hiking/climbing, you should let family/friends know in advance where you will be going and [register at mountain huts](https://www.slovenia.info/en/stories/take-a-break-at-a-mountain-hut). If you experience an emergency, call 112 for Slovenian police.
