# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Your U.S. passport will not prevent you from being detained, arrested, or prosecuted. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) website.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Slovenia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

**Make sure you receive a receipt for all purchases in Slovenia**. Slovenian law allows inspectors to request to see your receipt of purchase upon exiting the business. If you do not present a receipt, you can be fined.

Slovenian authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the import, export, and use of firearms. You should contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia](http://washington.embassy.si/index.php?id=51&L=1) in Washington, D.C. or the Consulate General in Cleveland if you are planning to transport a firearm into or out of Slovenia.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** Slovenian banks do not accept paper checks, including travelers checks from the United States. ATMs are common in all major cities and are increasingly common in rural areas. Credit cards are broadly accepted.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex marriage is legal in Slovenia. The LGB community is protected by anti-discrimination laws and there are no legal or governmental impediments to the organization of LGB events. Violence against LGB persons is not unprecedented, according to local NGOs. There have been several isolated violent incidents targeting LGB individuals in Slovenia.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Slovenia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging and general infrastructure, especially outside of the main cities, but common in public transportation and communication/information.

Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different in Slovenia from what you find in the United States. Under Slovenian law, persons with disabilities should have access to buildings, information, and communications. In practice, however, modification of public and private structures to improve access is a work in progress, and many buildings are not easily accessible. Most tourist destinations around Slovenia are accessible by those with disabilities.

Rental, repair, replacement parts for assistive devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are widely available.
