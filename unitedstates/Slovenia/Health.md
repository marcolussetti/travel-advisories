**Facilities**

* For emergency services in Slovenia, dial **112.** Ambulance services are widely available and reliable. When contacting an ambulance, if you do not speak Slovenian, you may need to find a Slovenian speaker who can explain your location.
* Medical care throughout Slovenia is comparable to that found in the United States. Emergency responders may determine that patients requiring specialized and more complex medical care need to be transported to Ljubljana Clinical Center (a public hospital) by air.
* While many medical providers in Slovenia speak excellent English, that may not be the case for all medical staff.
* There is a list of English-speaking medical providers and 24-hour pharmacies on the U.S. Embassy’s [website](https://si.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).
* U.S. citizens should expect to pay all medical bills up front at the time of service at public or private medical facilities.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, both within country and to the United States.
* **Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/slovenia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [Clinics for preventive vaccinations](https://nijz.si/en/) can provide more information. Make sure you are up-to-date on routine vaccines before every trip. These vaccines include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, and your yearly flu shot.
* Slovenia has a high incidence of Lyme disease and encephalitis, both transmitted by ticks. Consider getting a vaccine to prevent tick-borne encephalitis. This vaccine is not available in the United States, but it is available in Slovenia. Use insect repellent and inspect your body for ticks after being outdoors.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.
* Almost all prescriptions available in the United States are widely available in Slovenia (although may be under different names). You may need a prescription for medications (such as Ibuprofen when over 200 mg) that could be purchased over-the-counter in the United States.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#:~:text=Foreign%20Nationals:,Copy%20of%20Prescription%20(in%20English)) websites for more information. information.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Ljubljana has air pollution levels similar to those in major U.S. cities. Visit [the European Environment Agency’s website](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index/index) for information on air quality in Slovenia.

**Water Quality:**

* The tap water in Ljubljana and other cities in Slovenia is suitable for drinking. Precautions for safe food storage and preparation are the same as would be practiced in the United States. Detailed [laboratory reports about the water quality](https://www.nijz.si/sl/letna-porocila-o-pitni-vodi-v-sloveniji) are available in Slovenian language. Slovenia does not put fluoride in the tap water, so long term residents might want to consider fluoride supplements for their children.
