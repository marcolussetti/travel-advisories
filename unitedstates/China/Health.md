**Quality of Care:** The standards of medical care in the PRC are not equivalent to those in the United States. Even in private hospitals or public hospitals with well-equipped wards, English-speaking patients frequently encounter difficulty due to cultural, language, and regulatory differences. Rural areas may have less developed facilities and inadequate staffing. Additionally, Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain; the blood type of the general Asian populace is Rh positive.  
  
**Payment and Insurance:** Ambulances in the PRC are often slow to arrive. Many do not have sophisticated medical equipment or trained responders. Payment in cash or via mobile payment app for services is often required prior to treatment, including emergency cases. Travelers will be asked to pay a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals in major cities may accept foreign credit cards. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in the PRC maintain lists of local [English-speaking doctors and hospitals](https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/medical-assistance/).  
  
**The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. You must provide payment and seek reimbursement.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Public hospitals require pre-payment for services before providing treatment to foreigners. Most care providers in the PRC only accept payments in cash or via local mobile payment apps. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medication:** If traveling with prescription medication, make sure the medication is legal in the PRC by checking with the [Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America](http://us.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/). Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with the prescription. Many commonly used U.S. drugs and medications are not available in the PRC, and counterfeit, low-quality knockoffs are prevalent. If you have medications sent to you from outside the PRC, customs authorities may confiscate them, or you may have to pay high customs duties.  
  
**Air Quality**

Air pollution is a significant problem in many locations.  The PRC’s [Ministry of Ecology and Environment](https://english.mee.gov.cn/) also provides its own air quality data for cities throughout the PRC.  
  
Most roads and towns in Tibet, Qinghai, parts of Xinjiang, and western Sichuan are situated at altitudes over 10,000 feet. Take appropriate precautions to prepare for and be alert to altitude sickness.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
