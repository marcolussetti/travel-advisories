**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic safety is generally poor, and driving can be dangerous. Rules, regulations, and conditions vary greatly throughout the PRC.

Traffic can be chaotic and largely unregulated outside of major metropolitan areas. The rate of accidents, including fatal accidents, is among the highest in the world. Motorcycle and bicycle accidents are frequent and often deadly. Pedestrians do not have the right of way in the PRC. Be extremely cautious when walking in traffic, even in marked crosswalks when the walk light is green. Child safety seats are not widely available.

**Traffic Laws:**

* You may not drive in the PRC using a U.S. or international driver’s license.
* You can apply for a PRC driver’s license if you have a resident permit.
* If you are involved in a traffic accident, remain calm, call the police, and wait for their arrival. If there are no injuries and damage is minimal, the parties often come to an agreement on the spot.
* Unresolved disputes are handled by the courts.
* In cases involving injuries, the driver determined at fault is responsible for the injured person’s medical costs. Sometimes, the police may hold your passport until the other parties are satisfied with the compensation they receive.

Please refer to our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Also, please review the [Law of the People's Republic of China on Road Traffic Safety](http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/05/content_1381965.htm).

**Public Transportation:** Subways, trains, and buses are generally safe. Public transportation is widely available in major cities, although individuals on crowded buses and subways can be targeted by pickpockets.  
  
**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the PRC government’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of the PRC’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s Safety Assessment Page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to the PRC should check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI) web portal. More information may be available on the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Navigational Warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in PRC ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.
