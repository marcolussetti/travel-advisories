# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Most visitors to the PRC will not encounter safety concerns. Traffic accidents are the most common safety concern for U.S. citizens. Training, capability, and responsiveness of PRC authorities vary by region and even within cities. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General may not represent U.S. citizens in either criminal or civil legal matters. They have no law enforcement authority in the PRC.

To ensure your safety and security in the PRC, you should:

* Take routine safety precautions.
* Pay attention to surroundings.
* Report any concerns to the local police.
* **Call “110,”** the local equivalent to “911”. English services are often available, but you should not expect English services in remote parts of the PRC.

Violent crime is not common in the PRC, however:

* While sanctioned demonstrations must be approved by PRC authorities, they can turn violent.
* Domestic unrest and terrorism can occur.
* Stabbings targeting foreigners, including U.S. citizens, have occurred. Perpetrators in such instances have had no known relationship with victims.
* Business disputes between U.S. citizens and local business partners can sometimes result in physical confrontation, detainment, or coercion. Go straight to the police if you feel threatened or relocate to a public place.

Be alert to potential criminal schemes, such as:

* **“Tourist Tea” and Dating App Scams:** Locals invite visitors out and leave them with an exorbitant bill.
* **Phone Scams:** Callers pose as police officers and ask you to send money to resolve an identity theft or money laundering investigation. In these cases, DO NOT WIRE any money. If you receive any suspicious calls or requests, contact the local Public Security Bureau to verify the caller’s identity.
* **Unlicensed or Unapproved Cabs:** Taxi and ridesharing services in China are normally licensed by authorities. Be cautious when using taxi or ridesharing services that are not accessible through mobile applications. If you use the locally approved taxi service, insist that the driver use the meter, and get a receipt. Have the name of your destination written in Chinese characters and ask the driver to remove your bags from the trunk before you get out of the taxi and before you pay.
* **Counterfeit Currency:** With the ubiquitous and preferred use of mobile payment apps, counterfeit currency is less of a concern in the PRC now than in the past. When you need cash, only use ATMs at trusted financial institutions. Carry a variety of bills as vendors may have limited cash on hand to make change.

Be alert to potential criminal schemes. These can include: internet, phone scams, dating scams, and financial scams. If you are the victim of a scam, record as many details as possible, including names, telephone and bank numbers, and email and IP addresses. Then, file a police report, and inform the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate General. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault can contact the local police and should contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.
* Provide general information about the local investigative process and what happens next.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Lost or Stolen Passports:** If your passport is stolen, you must apply for both a new passport at the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General and a new PRC visa. File a police report at the nearest police station right away. You may also be directed to file a report at the local [Exit-Entry Bureau](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.nia.gov.cn%2F&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C9fc9e536bd5142e47db608dd29b17d1a%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638712564457770759%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3OpRDagXQp%2FONCmhZeqUGkFVZEZFVravDgR27RvW6sQ%3D&reserved=0).

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General for assistance. Domestic violence in the PRC is rarely recognized as a crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry in the PRC is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the PRC government or by recognized authorities. If you are seriously injured, sophisticated medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may be slower to respond in rural areas,  potentially delaying access to urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
