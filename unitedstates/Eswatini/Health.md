Medical facilities are limited throughout Eswatini, and emergency medical response capabilities (including ambulance transport) are very limited and almost non-existent in the rural areas. The **Ezulwini Private Hospital** in Ezulwini is a well-equipped and operated clinic. The Mbabane **Clinic** in the capital is small but it is well-equipped and well-staffed for minor procedures, as is the **Manzini Clinic** in Matsapha. For advanced care, U.S. citizens often choose to go to South Africa where better facilities and specialists exist. Most prescription drugs are available locally or can be imported from South Africa. Travelers are advised to bring sufficient quantities of their required medications in their original bottles

For emergency services in Eswatini, **dial 999**.

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except major cities or semi-urban areas.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medications, always, carry your prescription medications in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general**

* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Pharmaceuticals**

* If you take medication, research beforehand whether the medication is illegal in Eswatini
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items "https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items") and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm") websites for more information.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center "https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center") regarding specific issues in Eswatini.

**Air Quality**

* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter (dry) season when brush fires are common. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Eswatini.
