# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** While there are no specified concerns of terrorism for Eswatini, in general, terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists have increasingly used less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Regional Power Outages (load shedding):** Eswatini’s ability to deliver power to the electrical grid may be inhibited by on-going regional load-shedding. Precautions should be taken to carry a flashlight or non-electric light source in event of a sustained loss of power.

**Demonstrations:**Public protests, demonstrations, and strikes occur occasionally in Eswatini, mostly in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Armed law enforcement personnel have been known to use force to disrupt or control such events. During the course of such events, police may not distinguish between observers and protesters. You should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, so travelers should avoid areas near protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**CRIME:** Crime is the most significant threat to U.S. citizens and incidents of petty crime and violent crime are prevalent throughout Eswatini. Criminals will resort to force, including deadly force, to accomplish their goal and are not deterred by confrontations with their intended victims. Carjackings may become violent if victims do not immediately cooperate.

**Take Precautions:**

* Congested, urban areas are particularly dangerous at night. Exercise caution at all times.
* Do not to wear jewelry or carry expensive or unnecessary valuables in public.
* Do not display cell phones and large sums of cash.
* When using an ATM, always make sure to cover the screen as you enter your PIN, and have a plan in mind in the case that your card gets hacked.
* Convert currency at authorized currency exchanges; never with street vendors.
* Never store or leave items of value in your vehicle.
* Exercise caution when using local taxis.
* Ensure the taxi you use is from a reputable company.
* Never enter a taxi that is occupied by anyone besides the driver.
* Call a friend to let them know the plate number of the taxi you are using.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Emergency response is unreliable and subsequent appropriate medical treatment may not be available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
