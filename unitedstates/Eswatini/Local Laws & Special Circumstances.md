# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**The Monarchy:**There are special laws related to criticism of the monarchy in Eswatini. U.S. citizens should be aware of these laws and abide by them while in Eswatini.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Photography:** It is illegal to photograph Eswatini's government buildings, members of the Eswatini armed forces, royal residences, and official ceremonies without prior permission from government authorities.

**LGB Travelers:** While colonial-era legislation against sodomy remains in place, no penalties are specified, and there have been no arrests. The government of Eswatini denounces same-sex relationships and acts as illegal but has not prosecuted any cases. Societal discrimination against LGB persons is prevalent, and LGB persons generally conceal their sexual orientation.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**No laws mandate accessibility to buildings, transportation (including air travel), information, communications, or public services. Government buildings under construction may have some improvements for persons with disabilities, including access ramps. Public transportation is not easily accessible for persons with disabilities, and the government has not provided any means of alternative accessible transport. There are no programs in place to promote the rights of persons with disabilities.
