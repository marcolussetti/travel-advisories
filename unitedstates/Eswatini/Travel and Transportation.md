**Road Conditions and Safety:**Traffic accidents in Eswatini occur frequently and are a significant hazard. You should use extreme caution when driving, given the high rates of speed on major thoroughfares. Other hazards include poor lighting; presence of pedestrians, animals, and slower moving vehicles; aggressive driving behavior; and erratic stopping for pedestrians and animals. Exercise caution when driving at night and in fog, especially in rural areas. Rural and suburban areas are poorly lit and pose additional safety hazards, such as pedestrians and animals crossing the road. Many vehicles are poorly maintained and may lack working headlights.

**Traffic Laws:** Cars travel on the left in Eswatini, which requires U.S. drivers to exercise particular caution. Always carry your driver’s license as failure to do so will result in a fine. Cell phone use while driving is illegal in Eswatini.

The Royal Eswatini Police Service (REPS) sets up periodic road blocks and uses radar to monitor speed. If you are pulled over for a moving violation you are responsible for the consequences. The REPS sets up jaywalking stings which can result in fines and temporary detention for perpetrators. It is recommended that pedestrians use the available ‘zebra crosswalks’ when crossing streets.

**Public Transportation:**Extreme caution is recommended if using mini-bus taxis, locally known as khumbis, which follow fixed routes and are flagged down by passengers almost everywhere in Eswatini. Many of these vehicles fail to meet minimal safety standards. Drivers frequently overload the vehicles and travel at excessive speeds. Fatal accidents involving these conveyances are very common.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Eswatini, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Eswatini's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
