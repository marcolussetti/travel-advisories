Medical care in Uzbekistan is below U.S. standards with shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics. Some medication sold in local pharmacies is known to be counterfeit. Elderly travelers and those with pre-existing health problems may be at particular risk due to inadequate medical facilities. Most resident U.S. citizens travel to North America or Europe for their medical needs.

Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight, and medical staff may speak little or no English.  Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.  Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

For emergency services in Uzbekistan, dial 103 (Tashkent) or 03 (most of Uzbekistan).

 Other provider numbers are:

* Fire: 101 (Tashkent), 01 (most of Uzbekistan)
* Police: 102 (Tashkent), 02 (most of Uzbekistan)
* Ministry of Emergency Situations: 1050 (Tashkent), 050 (most of Uzbekistan)

Ambulance services are:

* widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* staffed with trained physicians and paramedics with limited medical equipment.
* private ambulance services may have quicker response times and are available in some major cities.
* very few English-speaking providers are available.
* injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travelstate-usdos.msappproxy.net/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/human-drug-imports#:~:text=Imported%20drugs%20must%20meet%20FDA's,drugs%20subject%20to%20FDA%20oversight.) websites for more information.
* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Uzbekistan’s laws and legislation](https://uz.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/prescription-medicines/) to ensure the medication is legal in Uzbekistan.

**Vaccinations:**  Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Water Quality:** In many areas of Uzbekistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality**:  Air pollution is a significant problem in major cities in Uzbekistan. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
