# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be expelled, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe. Expect long jail sentences and heavy fines if you are convicted.
* It is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking photographs of anything of possible military or security interest.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport, visa, and visa registration, since local police may conduct document inspections. Check your visa and registration validity dates regularly, and renew them before they expire.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** Sexual relations between men are against the law and punishable by up to three years’ imprisonment. The law does not specifically address same-sex sexual activity between women. Same-sex sexual activity is a taboo subject in Uzbekistani society, and there are no registered LGB organizations.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Uzbekistan prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Buildings, public transportation, and social infrastructure facilities, such as clinics and schools, are rarely adapted for use by persons with disabilities.
