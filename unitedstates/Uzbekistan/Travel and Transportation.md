# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Uzbekistan has a developed but inconsistently maintained traffic infrastructure. Although main roads in central Tashkent are relatively well maintained, many secondary roads inside and outside Tashkent are in poor condition. Exercise caution on rural or mountainous roads.

Driving at night can be dangerous. Rural roads and highways are generally not lit, and only major cities have streetlights. The fuel supply can be sporadic, and travelers may encounter occasional difficulty finding gasoline outside Tashkent.

Livestock, as well as farm equipment and animal-drawn carts that lack lights or reflectors, are found on both urban and rural roads at any hour. Local drivers are unfamiliar with safe driving techniques. Drivers often disregard traffic signals, ignore lane markings, and move erratically and at high speeds. Pedestrians cross streets unexpectedly and often without looking for oncoming traffic.

Passersby and drivers generally respond quickly to automobile accidents and notify relevant authorities; however, police may not arrive at the scene right away. There are private roadside assistance services available in Uzbekistan that can assist with towing, fuel refill, tire replacement, etc.

**Traffic Laws:**Uzbekistan has a large traffic police force, which frequently stops drivers for minor infractions or simple document checks. There have been reports of traffic police harassing foreign drivers and asking them for bribes.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in the city is often overcrowded and not always safe. Avoid using unmarked taxis or entering a cab that already has passengers. Most taxis lack working seatbelts in the back seat. Buses and shuttle buses (marshrutkas), especially in residential areas, lack necessary route maps and information, and driver schedules may be unpredictable.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Uzbekistan’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Uzbekistan’s air carrier operations.
