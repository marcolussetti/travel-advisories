# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Uzbekistan](https://www.uzbekistan.org/) website for the most current visa information.

There are two types of visas that are available for Uzbekistan, "physical” and “e-visa.” For both types of visas:

* Visitors may not enter Uzbekistan with a valid Uzbek visa in a canceled or expired U.S. passport, even if they present another valid U.S. passport at the port of entry.
* If a traveler has a single-entry visa, they cannot re-enter Uzbekistan using the same visa.

**Physical Visas:** Some categories of travelers such as students, investors, and businesspersons require a physical visa. U.S. citizens should apply for physical visas well in advance of their travel and should apply through Uzbekistan’s consular missions abroad, including the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C. A list of Uzbekistan’s consular missions abroad is available on the official website of the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mfa.uz/en/).

**E-Visas:** Travelers wishing to enter for Uzbekistan for tourism for 30 days or less may apply for an e-visa. E-visa application processing, including fees and visa validity, can be found by visiting the [Embassy of Uzbekistan website](https://uzbekistan.org/visa/). The e-visa application is submitted through the government of Uzbekistan’s [e-visa portal](https://e-visa.gov.uz/main).

**Tips for entering Uzbekistan on an E-Visa:**

* Travelers must ensure they receive email confirmation that their e-visa is **approved.** Confirmation of payment is not confirmation of visa approval.
* Travelers should print and carry the e-visa approval with them to Uzbekistan.
* E-visas cannot be extended in Uzbekistan. Travelers seeking a longer period of stay may apply for a regular, physical tourist visa through Uzbekistan’s consular missions abroad.
* If a traveler believes they have a valid and approved e-visa, but Uzbekistan immigration authorities are unable to verify it, the traveler may contact the following public phone numbers within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Hotline: +998 71-200-00-88; Visa Issues: +998 71-236-27-07.

**Visa-free Entry for U.S. Citizens under 16:** U.S. citizens who are under 16 and traveling for tourism are eligible for a visa-free regime. They should present a valid U.S. passport at the point of entry and must be accompanied by their legal guardians. The period of stay generally will correspond with the duration of the visa of the accompanying guardian and will not exceed 90 days. More information is available at the [Embassy of Uzbekistan](https://uzbekistan.org/) website.

**Visa-free Entry for Foreign Citizens over 55:** U.S. citizens who are older than 55 and traveling for tourism are eligible for a visa-free regime with a valid passport. The period of stay cannot exceed 30 days. More information is available at the [Embassy of Uzbekistan](https://uzbekistan.org/) website.

**Registration:** The government of Uzbekistan requires all foreigners to register with the local authorities within three days of arrival in Uzbekistan.  From the date of the initial registration, travelers are responsible for maintaining uninterrupted registration. Visit our [Registration in Uzbekistan](https://uz.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/registration-in-uzbekistan/) website for more information.

**Border Crossings:** Travel within Uzbekistan by rail or land sometimes requires brief entries into neighboring countries. Travelers should obtain a multiple-entry Uzbek visa as well as proper visas for the relevant neighboring countries, if needed.

**Airport Screening Procedures:** All travelers should anticipate strict airport security screening procedures. Travelers wishing to be screened privately should note secondary screening procedures are more thorough than those conducted at the primary security checkpoint.

**HIV/AIDS:** Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Uzbekistan. Long-term visitors may be required to submit HIV test results along with their visa application. For more information, contact the [Embassy of Uzbekistan](https://uzbekistan.org/) before you travel.
