# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists.
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Demonstrations** are rare and unlikely to occur, particularly inside Tashkent. However, clashes between police and protesters have resulted in deaths in the past.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.
* Past demonstrations have ended in mass arrests.
* Check local and/or social media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Violent demonstrations may be more likely outside the capital city.

**Crime:**Violent crime against foreign nationals is rare, but can occur, especially in larger cities and primarily during late night hours. In urban areas, travelers are urged to take the same precautions they would take in any large U.S. city. If traveling at night, stay in well-lit areas, travel in groups, maintain a low profile, and do not display large amounts of cash. Beware of pickpockets in public places, such as tourist destinations, train stations, and local markets. Although using private cars as taxis is common in Uzbekistan, U.S. citizens, especially women, should not consider this a safe practice. U.S. citizens are encouraged to use clearly marked taxis, such as those at hotels, and should avoid riding in unmarked taxis.

**Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
