[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Royal Norwegian Embassy](https://www.norway.no/en/usa) website for the most current visa information.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, be familiar with the requirements of the [Schengen Agreement](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/schengen.html).

Your passport should be valid for at least three months beyond your period of stay if you plan on transiting a Schengen country. Please review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/schengen.html) page. We recommend you have at least six month’s validity remaining.

You will need sufficient proof of funds and a return plane ticket.

The 12-page U.S. emergency passport is not valid for visa-free entry into Norway.

For more information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/).

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Norway.
