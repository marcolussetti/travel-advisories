# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:**The maintenance and condition of urban roads is generally good. Rural road conditions are fair, and the availability of roadside assistance is limited.

* Roadside assistance is mainly provided by two service providers in Norway: Viking (phone number +47 06000) and Falck (phone number +47 02222). Both service providers operate with 24/7 duty phones.
* Most roadways beyond the city limits of Oslo and other major cities tend to be simple two-lane roads. In mountainous areas of Norway, the roads tend to be narrow, winding, and have many tunnels.
* **Road conditions vary greatly**, depending on weather and time of year. Extreme weather, floods, and landslides can occur. This can disrupt both rail and road travel.
* **The use of winter tires is mandatory on all motor vehicles from November to April.**
* Many mountain roads are closed due to snow from late fall to late spring.

**Traffic Laws:**Norwegian law requires that drivers always use headlights when driving. Norwegian law also requires drivers to yield to vehicles coming from the right, except in a traffic circle, when drivers are required to yield to vehicles already in the circle.

* Seatbelts are mandatory for drivers and passengers.
* It is illegal to use a hand-held cell phone while driving; violators risk a fine of 1,300 kroner (approximately $215).
* Automatic cameras placed by the police along roadways help enforce speed limits, which are often lower than in other European countries. **Fines – and sometimes even jail time – are imposed for violations.**
* **The maximum legal blood alcohol content level for driving a car in Norway is .02 percent.** Police conduct frequent road checks with mandatory breathalyzer tests, and driving under the influence can lead to a stiff jail sentence.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Norway’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Norway’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
