**Road Conditions and Safety:**The maintenance and condition of urban roads is generally good. Rural road conditions are fair. The availability of roadside assistance is limited.

* Roadside assistance is mainly provided by two service providers in Norway: Viking (phone number +47 06000) and Falck (phone number +47 02222). Both service providers operate with 24/7 duty phones.
* Most roadways beyond the city limits of Oslo and other major cities tend to be simple two-lane roads. In mountainous areas of Norway, the roads tend to be narrow, winding, and have many tunnels.
* **Road conditions vary greatly**, depending on weather and time of year. Extreme weather, floods, and landslides can occur. This can disrupt both rail and road travel.
* **The use of winter tires is mandatory on all motor vehicles from November to April.**
* The [Norwegian Government’s Crisis Information website](https://www.emergencyalert.no/) gives information and advice to the public. It does this before, during, and after a crisis.
* Many mountain roads are closed due to snow from late fall to late spring.

**Traffic Laws:** In Norway the law requires that drivers always use headlights. Norwegian law also requires drivers to yield to vehicles coming from the right, except in a traffic circle, when drivers are required to yield to vehicles already in the circle.

* Seatbelts are mandatory for drivers and passengers.
* It is illegal to use a hand-held cell phone while driving; violators risk a fine of 10200 kroner (approximately $950.)
* Speed limits are photo enforced and often lower than in other European countries. **Fines – and sometimes even jail time – are imposed for violations.**
* **The maximum legal blood alcohol content level for driving a car in Norway is .02 percent.** Police conduct frequent road checks with mandatory breathalyzer tests. Driving drunk can lead to a stiff jail sentence.

**Public Transportation:** Is widely accessible and is well developed. Buses and trains are the most common means of transportation across the country and regarded to be safe. Public transportation is sparser in rural areas. Taxies are of newer models with some electric taxies in city areas. Oslo is the only city with subway lines in Norway. Be vigilant of your belongings when traveling in cities, especially in transportation hubs.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Norway’s Civil Aviation Authority

meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Norway should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings)website.
