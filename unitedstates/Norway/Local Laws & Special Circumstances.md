# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested, or imprisoned. For instance, it is generally illegal to carry knives or other sharp objects in Norway. People starting a business or practicing a regulated profession should seek information from local authorities, before they start operating.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Flying Drones:** The use of drones in Norway is highly regulated. In many instances, it is **forbidden** to operate drones in Norway over areas with air traffic, above city and town centers, nature conservation areas, prisons, embassies, and military areas. It is important to know the rules and regulations regarding drone usage because violators can be subject to fines, arrest, imprisonment, and, in some cases, deportation. For a review of the full and updated rules, read the [Norwegian Civil Authority's Aviation](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fluftfartstilsynet.no%2Fen%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cbjornstadst%40state.gov%7Cc07bc1a09ea14e4d2adb08dca58f1b13%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638567281249699992%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6wlJR1AGRXbNyT%2BvHL8FF7NeQyUMAugQi6z5250CHfQ%3D&reserved=0) website which offers information regarding drone usage.

**Svalbard:** Svalbard is an archipelago. It has nine main islands. They are between mainland Norway and the North Pole. **You need a passport to enter Svalbard.**

* Unlike Norway’s mainland, Svalbard is not in the Schengen Agreement. Air travelers to Svalbard from Norway will leave the Schengen Zone before boarding.
* Svalbard's extreme weather and limited transport pose unique dangers to travelers.
* The U.S. Embassy has no staff in Svalbard. This limits its ability to provide consular help in emergencies.
* Check that you have enough travel, medical, and medical evacuation insurance. It should cover the potential costs of treatment or repatriation before you go to Svalbard.
* Roads exist in the three largest towns – Longyearbyen, Barentsburg, and Ny-Aalesund. But, the roads do not connect. So, the only options for traveling throughout Svalbard are sea, snowmobile, or limited air service.
  + Tourism to Ny-Aalesund is **restricted**due to its status as a research facility and the danger of **polar bear attacks**.
* There have been several reported deaths and injuries to tourists in the Svalbard archipelago. These incidents were due to animal attacks and boating accidents. They often involved unpredictable weather or ocean conditions.
* In cases of illness or injury, a clinic in Longyearbyen can provide limited emergency care. They provide care until medical evacuation to Tromso is available.
  + You should ask the [Svalbard Tourist Board](https://en.visitsvalbard.com/) for the latest travel conditions and information. Do this before you go.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Child Protection Laws:** The treatment of children is taken very seriously in Norway. All forms of corporal punishment of children are against the law, and any form of violence, humiliating treatment, or neglect may result in the child being taken away from parents by the Norwegian authorities and placed into long-term care by Norway’s social services.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex sexual relations, the provision of information or services to persons on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation, or the organization of events focused on sexual orientation in Norway.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Norway prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include physically accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in certain rural areas and certain private businesses. Accessibility is common on public transportation, lodging facilities, information areas, in public spaces and in many private ones.

Residents of Norway with disabilities are provided with assistive technology through the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration (NAV). Limited equipment support may be available through private resources.

Oslo Gardermoen International Airport is accessible to wheelchair users and the staff is very helpful with accessibility issues.

* The Oslo subway/light-rail system (T-banen) has above-average wheelchair accessibility.
* Taxi drivers are generally helpful in assisting wheelchair users. It is possible to order taxis with wheelchair lifts.
* From **December to March** it is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to navigate Oslo’s streets without assistance due to snow and ice.
* Shopping malls, hotels, public buildings, and most modern structures will have accessible toilets.
* Fewer than half of the restaurants in Norway are wheelchair accessible and many have restrooms located up or down a flight of stairs.
* Many modern public structures, such as shopping centers, substitute inclined moving walkways/ramps for elevators, which are difficult for wheelchair users to use safely.
* [Norway’s Tourist Board website](https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/travelling-with-disabilities/) offers accessibility information specifically for ferries.
