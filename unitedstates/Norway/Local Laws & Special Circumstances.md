# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested, or imprisoned. For instance, it is generally illegal to carry knives or other sharp objects in Norway. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities before practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Svalbard:**The Svalbard archipelago consists of nine main islands located midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.  You need a passport to enter Svalbard.

* Unlike Norway’s mainland, Svalbard is not party to the Schengen Agreement and air travelers to Svalbard from Norway will depart the Schengen Zone prior to boarding.
* Travelers to Svalbard face unique hazards given the extreme weather conditions and limited transport infrastructure.
* The U.S. Embassy has no direct representation on Svalbard, limiting its ability to provide emergency consular services.
* Verify that you have adequate travel, medical, and medical evacuation insurance to cover the potential costs of medical treatment or repatriation before you travel to Svalbard.
* Although road systems exist within the three largest towns – Longyearbyen, Barentsburg, and Ny-Alesund – they do not connect with each other, making sea, snowmobile, or limited air service the only options for traveling throughout Svalbard.
* Tourism to Ny-Alesund is restricted due to its status as a research facility and the danger of polar bear attacks.
* There have been several reported instances of death or injury to tourists in the Svalbard archipelago due to animal attacks and boating incidents, often involving unpredictable weather or ocean conditions.
* In cases of illness or injury, a clinic in Longyearbyen can provide limited emergency care until medical evacuation to Tromsoe is available.
* You should consult the [Svalbard Tourist Board](https://en.visitsvalbard.com/) for the latest travel conditions and information before you go.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States.  See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Child Protection Laws:** The treatment of children is taken very seriously in Norway. All forms of corporal punishment of children are against the law, and any form of violence, humiliating treatment, or neglect may result in the child being taken away from parents by the Norwegian authorities and placed into long-term care by Norway’s social services.

**Faith-Based Travelers:**  See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Norway.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  While in Norway, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from that in the United States.

* Oslo Gardermoen International Airport is accessible to wheelchair users and the staff is very helpful with accessibility issues.
* The Oslo subway/light-rail system (T-banen) has above-average wheelchair accessibility.
* Taxi drivers are generally helpful in assisting wheelchair users.  It is possible to order taxis with wheelchair lifts.
* From December to March it is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to navigate Oslo’s streets without assistance due to snow and ice.
* Shopping malls, hotels, public buildings, and most modern structures will have accessible toilets.
* Fewer than half of the restaurants in Norway are wheelchair accessible and many have restrooms located up or down a flight of stairs.
* Many modern public structures, such as shopping centers, substitute inclined moving walkways/ramps for elevators, which are difficult for wheelchair users to use safely.
* [Norway’s Tourist Board website](https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/travelling-with-disabilities/) offers accessibility information specifically for ferries.
