Medical facilities are widely available and of high quality but may be limited outside larger urban areas. The remote and sparse populations in northern Norway and the dependence on ferries to cross fjords of western Norway may affect transportation and ready access to medical facilities. The U.S. Embassy in Oslo maintains a [list of emergency medical and dental clinics](https://no.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance-2/) in major cities.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general:**

* The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of [doctors and hospitals](https://no.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance-2/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.
* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Medical staff may speak limited English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Norway.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Norway.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often more difficult to obtain in Norway. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Norway does not allow the importation of some medications that are legal in the United States by prescription.   Please review Norway’s rules on medications [here](https://www.dmp.no/en/manufacturing-import-and-retailing-of-medicines/importing-medicines-for-personal-use).

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* Surrogacy is illegal in Norway.

**Adventure Travel**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).
* The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are usually identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.
* In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
* At certain times of year, there are increased risks of avalanche and hidden crevasses in mountainous areas throughout Norway.  Rapid weather changes may also create hazards in backcountry areas.  We encourage you to check with local authorities and websites showing current conditions before engaging in outdoor sporting activities.
* If you plan to travel to Svalbard, please see more information above.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more information on [insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html).
