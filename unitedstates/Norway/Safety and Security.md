# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Norway has a low level of crime and violent crime is uncommon.

* The most common crimes are home and office burglaries and petty thefts.
* Pickpockets target tourists in crowded areas like hotels and transit stations. Be vigilant in these high-risk locations to protect your belongings. The Oslo Central train station is an especially popular area for pickpockets and bag snatchers.
* Violent and weapon-related crimes are rare, but they do occur in areas with drug trafficking and gang problems. This includes parts of eastern Oslo.
* As in any other urban area, you should remain aware of your surroundings at all times.

**Scams**: Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Norway. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and damage abroad. Before traveling abroad, follow best practices. Keep all software, like the operating system and apps, updated. Also, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) apps if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps help U.S. citizens get around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(47) 2130-8540. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are usually identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. At certain times of year, there are increased risks of avalanche and hidden crevasses in mountainous areas throughout Norway. Rapid weather changes may also create hazards in backcountry areas. We encourage you to check with local authorities and websites showing current conditions before engaging in outdoor sporting activities.If you plan to travel to Svalbard, please see more information below. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
