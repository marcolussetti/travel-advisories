# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

*Terroris*m: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Norway has a low level of crime and violent crime is uncommon.

* The most likely forms of crime, especially in the Oslo metropolitan area, include residential and office burglaries and petty thefts.
* Pickpocketing and petty theft occur more frequently in major tourist areas, hotel lobbies, train and transit stations, and surrounding areas. The Oslo Central train station is an especially popular area for pickpockets and bag snatchers.
* Although rare, violent and weapons-related crimes do occur in areas known to have drug trafficking and gang problems, such as certain parts of eastern Oslo. As in any other urban area, you should remain aware of your surroundings at all times.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(47) 2130-8540. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are usually identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. At certain times of year, there are increased risks of avalanche and hidden crevasses in mountainous areas throughout Norway.  Rapid weather changes may also create hazards in backcountry areas.  We encourage you to check with local authorities and websites showing current conditions before engaging in outdoor sporting activities.
