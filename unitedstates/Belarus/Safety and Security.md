# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks. All European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

**Demonstrations** intended to be peaceful can sometimes become confrontational. For this reason, it is recommended that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations and protest gatherings.

* **Demonstrations,** both organized and spontaneous, are infrequent in Belarus. Localized street disturbances relating to **political events** are more likely in Minsk or larger cities than in smaller towns and villages.
* **Authorities have used force** to disperse demonstrators, including those who are peacefully demonstrating.
* Bystanders, including foreign nationals, **may face the possibility of arrest or detention**.

Foreigners may be **placed under surveillance**. Hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.

**Taking photographs** of anything that could be perceived as being of **military or security interest** may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation.

**Crime:** Belarus has a low rate of street crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare; criminals have been known to use force if met with resistance from victims.

* Common street crime, such as mugging and pickpocketing, occurs most frequently near public transportation venues, near hotels frequented by foreigners, and/or at night in poorly-lit areas.
* Exercise caution when visiting bars, casinos and night clubs, and do not leave your drink unattended. There have been reports of travelers being drugged and subsequently robbed or assaulted while visiting night clubs.
* Prostitutes at hotels may attempt to open hotel room doors in search of customers.
* Local and transnational **organized criminal activity exists** in Belarus. Most casinos and adult clubs are operated by criminal elements and should be avoided.
* Theft of vehicle parts and car vandalism is common. Sport-utility and luxury vehicles tend to be the most sought-after. Parking in a secure area overnight is highly recommended.

**Internet-Dating Schemes and Cyber-Crime:** "Internet brides" are advertised on several websites and are not always legitimate. Often, potential suitors in the United States lose thousands of dollars sending money to people they have never met and will never hear from again. In some cases, the foreigner is invited to visit Belarus; the Belarusian “friend” collects money for lodging and transportation expenses and then disappears.

**Cyber-crime** is well developed in Belarus. Merchandise orders with fraudulent credit cards, ID theft, hacking/blackmail schemes, and advance-fee fraud are gaining in popularity. If doing business electronically with persons or firms in Belarus, proceed with extreme caution.

* Use only ATMs located inside major banks.
* Use of credit and debit cards is not recommended; there have been **reports of U.S. citizens** having their ATM or credit cards skimmed resulting in fraudulent charges or money stolen from their accounts.
* Be aware that due to a lack of tourism infrastructure in Belarus, transferring funds from abroad, replacing stolen traveler's checks or airline tickets, or canceling credit cards can be difficult in Belarus.

**Counterfeit and pirated goods** are widely available. Transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. In addition, bringing them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines.

**Sophisticated criminal investigations** may be inconclusive because of a lack of resources and/or political will.

We have received reports of **harassment of U.S. citizens** at border crossings. We recommend that you report any crimes immediately to the local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +375 17 210 1283. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime that occurs in Belarus.

The local equivalents to the “911” emergency lines in Belarus are: 101 for Fire and Rescue Squad; 102 for Police; and 103 for Ambulance (Medical Emergency).

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
