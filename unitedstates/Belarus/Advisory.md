***Reissued after periodic review without changes to Level 4: Do Not Travel status.***

**Do not travel to Belarus** due to the Belarusian authorities’ arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the risk of detention, the continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the potential of civil unrest, and the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus. **U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately.**

On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. **All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice.** U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon as possible and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.

Belarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarusian authorities **may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals’ U.S. citizenship, and may deny or delay U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals.**

Due to Belarusian authorities’ arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the risk of detention, continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and the heightened volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security environment, **do not travel to Belarus**.

**U.S. citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations.** Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, **may face the possibility of arrest or detention.**

Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.

U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate possible departure plans in the event of an emergency. Border crossings with neighboring states are sometimes closed with little notice. Additional closures of crossing points along Belarus’ borders with Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Ukraine are possible.

**Country Summary:** Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens and other foreign citizens, for alleged affiliations with opposition parties and alleged participation in political demonstrations, even if there is evidence this affiliation took place outside of Belarus. Approximately 1,300 prisoners are currently jailed for politically-related acts that may not be considered crimes in the United States. The Belarusian government has denied prisoners access to their Embassy and lawyers, restricted communication with family outside prisons, and limited access to information. Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor. U.S. citizens in the vicinity of demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment and/or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media.

On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a commercial aircraft transiting Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an Advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating at all altitudes in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) subject to limited exceptions. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions)
