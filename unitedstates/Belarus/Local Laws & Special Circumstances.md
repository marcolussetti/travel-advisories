# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Under local law, any agency that detains a foreigner should inform the local Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) within 24 hours from the time of detention. The MFA, in its turn, must notify the respective embassy as soon as possible. The time of such notifications has varied from several hours to several weeks. Therefore, we recommend that if travelers have a chance to inform friends or relatives about their arrest, they should request that their friends or relatives notify the U.S. Embassy on their behalf as soon as possible.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

Currency:

* Belarusian **banks provide limited cash withdrawals** in Belarusian rubles from major credit cards. Please see notes on cyber-crime, above, regarding the security of ATMs.
* Authorized **currency exchange centers are widely available** throughout major cities.
* It is a **criminal offense to exchange payment in U.S. dollars** to firms or individuals without a special license.
* Only a few large firms are **licensed to accept U.S. dollars**. Travelers are advised to only use widely available licensed exchange locations.
* **ATMs are available for use;** credit and debit cards are widely accepted in major cities and towns; however use caution (see cyber-crime above).

Identification:

* Carry your passport at all times.
* Police have the authority to stop you and request identification. If you fail to provide your ID, you may be detained by the police until your identity is established.

Radiation:

* The 1986 release of nuclear material from the Chernobyl nuclear station in Ukraine affected Belarus. The city of Minsk was mostly spared, but other areas of Belarus were badly contaminated. Several years of monitoring have shown that radiation levels in Minsk are within internationally acceptable standards, and periodic testing of foodstuffs from various locations in Belarus has not revealed a level of radiation that would be considered harmful.

Marriages in Belarus:

* Consult the [U.S. Embassy Minsk website](https://by.usembassy.gov/) for information on [getting married in Belarus](http://law.by/faqs/marriage/).
* Marriages must be performed at a registrar’s office (ZAGS- Office of Matrimonial Acts Registration) to be legally valid in Belarus.
