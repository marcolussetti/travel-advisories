**30 Day Visa Free Travel**

U.S. passport holders traveling to Belarus via Minsk International Airport may enter visa-free for up to 30 days (the 30-day limit includes the day of arrival and the day of departure) for tourism or business.

**Visa-Free Travel Requirements**

U.S. citizens wishing to enter Belarus for 30 days without a visa must:

* Hold a valid passport;
* Enter and exit Belarus via Minsk International Airport;
* Arrive from and depart to any country other than the Russian Federation;
* Show evidence of finances in the form of cash, credit cards or travelers checks equivalent to 25 Euros for each day of stay;
* Show evidence of a medical insurance policy with at least 10,000 Euros of coverage valid throughout Belarus. Such a policy may be purchased at the airport upon arrival; please see the [Embassy of Belarus website](https://usa.mfa.gov.by/en/) for information about current fees; and
* Register with the local office of the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Ministry of the Interior for stays longer than five working days (see below).

**The Visa-free option is not available to you if:**

* You are coming directly to or from the Russian Federation.
* You enter and exit Belarus anywhere other than Minsk International Airport.
* You plan to stay longer than 30 days.
* You are entering on a diplomatic or official passport.

Travelers who stay longer than 30 days or who violate the visa-free registration rules can face administrative action which may include a fine of up to €550, deportation, and prohibition from entering Belarus in the future.

Visitors to Belarus may request a visa before traveling from the Embassy of Belarus. Instructions for obtaining a visa are available on the [Embassy of Belarus website](https://usa.mfa.gov.by/en/). Please note that the Government of Belarus has the authority to deny entry to any foreign visitor whether or not he/she has a visa.

**Travelling between Russia and Belarus**

**Car and Train Travel:** Belarus and Russia do not have international passport control capabilities at the land border. Therefore, U.S. citizens and other foreigners, even those holding valid visas, may not cross the Belarusian – Russian border by car, train, or on foot. Only Russian and Belarusian passport holders may transit the land border.

**Air Travel:** U.S. citizens require a visa in order to travel by air between Belarus and Russia. Regulations regarding travel between Russia and Belarus may change unexpectedly. Even if you already hold a visa, before planning a trip we recommend you visit the [Embassy of Belarus website](https://usa.mfa.gov.by/en/) and the website of [the Embassy of the Russian Federation](https://washington.mid.ru/en/consular-services/citizens-usa/visa-to-russia/) for the latest information.

**Registration**

All U.S. citizens staying in Belarus for **more than five business days** are required to register with the local office of the Citizenship and Migration Department of the Ministry of Interior (formerly OVIR). This requirement applies to visa holders and those who enter Belarus under the 30-day visa-free regime. Please keep in the mind the following:

* Registration must be completed within five business days of arrival.
* If you are staying in a hotel, the hotel will complete the registration for you.
* If you have a short term rental of an apartment or house, be sure to check with the rental agent; they may be able to assist you.
* If you are staying in a private home, you must complete the registration process yourself.
* If you fail to register or if you remain in Belarus longer than 30 days you will face administrative action which may include a fine of up to €550, deportation, and prohibition from entering Belarus in the future.
* Foreign citizens entering on a tourist or business visa may not stay in Belarus for more than 90 days total during any calendar year, including dates of entry and departure.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Belarus on a 30-day visit. Long-term residents (those spending more than 90 days a year in Belarus) or students must obtain an HIV/AIDS test in Belarus and submit the results to the Department of Citizenship and Migration when applying for an extension of stay or residency. We recommend you verify this information with the [Embassy of Belarus](https://usa.mfa.gov.by/en/) before you travel.
