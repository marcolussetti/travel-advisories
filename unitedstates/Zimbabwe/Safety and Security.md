# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

See the Department of State [Travel Advisory and](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/zimbabwe-travel-advisory.html) Alerts for Zimbabwe.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Criminals operate in the vicinity of hotels, restaurants, and shopping areas of major cities and tourist areas such as Victoria Falls. The downtown sectors of Harare, and its high-density residential suburbs, are particularly high-crime areas.

While in Zimbabwe:

* Always secure your possessions while in in public areas.
* Avoid displaying or carrying unnecessary valuables and large sums of money.
* Leave your passport and valuables in the hotel safety deposit box or room safe.

For your safety while driving/riding in a car:

* Be alert for “smash and grabs,” where thieves break car windows while you are stopped at intersections and take things within reach.
* Keep car doors locked and windows rolled up.
* Put valuable things under car seats or in the trunk.
* Leave sufficient room between cars to maneuver and drive away from danger.
* If you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station or other protected public area for assistance.
* Reduce your time at traffic lights at night by slowing in anticipation of the light change.
* Be cautious of ploys to lure you out of your car and of drivers in vehicles without license plates who stop to render aid or cause minor accidents.
* Drive to a well-lit and populated area before making repairs or exchanging information following an accident.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Demonstrations** can occur with little notice. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to police at the Harare Central Police Station, 777-777, and contact the U.S. Embassy at + 263 867 701 1000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
