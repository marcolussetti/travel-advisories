The public medical infrastructure in Zimbabwe is far below U.S. standards and medical facilities are limited. Provincial hospitals in rural areas are rudimentary and not equipped to care for serious injuries. Serious illnesses or injuries require medical evacuation to South Africa.

You should:

* Bring medications sufficient for the duration of your trip in original packaging;
* Carry your prescriptions;
* Be prepared to pay up front for medical services; and
* Be prepared to arrange your own transportation to medical facilities.

For emergency services in Zimbabwe dial 999 for medical or 995 for police.

Ambulance services are:

* available in the urban areas of Harare and Bulawayo and the tourist area of Victoria Falls, but training and response times of emergency responders is below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the rest of the country or are unreliable in most areas except major urban centers and Victoria Falls.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

The power supply in Zimbabwe is 220 volt 50 Hz and unreliable. Travelers who use electrical medical devices should consider alternatives and verify with lodging accommodations that your needs can be met.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to ensure the medication is legal in Zimbabwe.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closely monitors the prevalence of disease in Zimbabwe and updates the Travel Health Notice accordingly. Monitor the [CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/zimbabwe) for current information.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.

The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the southern hemisphere winter. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

**Health facilities in general:**

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies. Private medical facilities in Harare, Bulawayo, and the tourist area of Victoria Falls can stabilize patients in emergencies.
* Hospitals and doctors normally require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institution

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on medical tourism.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Zimbabwe.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Zimbabwe does not allow the importation of Oxycodone, even with a prescription. Travelers should nor carry Oxycodone.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Zimbabwe to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* There is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Zimbabwe. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Zimbabwe courts.
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in Zimbabwe via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution.

**Water Quality**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).
* CDC recommends that travelers going to Zimbabwe take prescription medicine to prevent malaria. Depending on the medicine you take, you will need to start taking this medicine multiple days before your trip, as well as during and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about which malaria medication you should take.
