# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some crimes are prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Zimbabwe can be severe, and convicted offenders can expect average jail sentences of three to seven years and heavy fines. Authorities may detain you for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you or for taking pictures of government buildings and police stations.

Fines for overstaying a visa can be over 1,000 USD and may involve time in jail. Visitors should pay careful attention to the authorized-until-date marked on their entry visa.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**Photography**: *Photographing the Munhumutapa Building, which houses the President’s offices, is punishable by a jail term and there is no provision for paying a fine.* It is not always apparent what the police deem sensitive, and they have detained people for photographing anything they view as sensitive, no matter how innocuous it may seem. *You should seriously consider the risks of taking pictures anywhere in Zimbabwe other than game parks and other obvious tourist attractions.*

**Political Sensitivities:** U.S. citizens have been detained and threatened with expulsion for administering humanitarian aid and expressing political opinions or criticism of the government. The streets around the President’s residence and the Botanical Gardens are closed to vehicle, bicycle, and foot traffic from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily. President Mnangagwa and senior government officials travel around Harare with large and aggressive motorcades that have been known to run motorists off the road. Security personnel occasionally beat and harass drivers who fail to pull out of the way quickly. Move quickly off the road and come to a complete stop if overtaken by a motorcade.

**Currency:** You should carefully review the U.S. sanctions program currently in place prior to engaging in the purchase/sale or transfer of money and other assets with a Zimbabwean citizen or entity. U.S. citizens are advised to consult the [Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information) for up-to-date information on these sanctions.

**Roadblocks:** The Government of Zimbabwe frequently uses marked and unmarked roadblocks to enforce order and collect fines, particularly in urban centers and on major roads. Quickly comply when instructed by police or security officials to stop at a roadblock.

**Game Parks:** Safety standards and training vary at game parks and wildlife viewing areas. You should ascertain whether operators are trained and licensed. All animals should be respected as wild and extremely dangerous. Travelers should keep a safe distance from animals and remain in vehicles or other protected enclosures when visiting game parks.

**Hunting:** Tourists wishing to hunt in Zimbabwe must be accompanied by a licensed operator. You should request and check the authenticity of their license by contacting the [Zimbabwe Professional Guides Association (Z.P.G.A)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzpga.org%2F&data=04%7C01%7CEHRENDREICHR%40state.gov%7Cc8a8e6f7a0044bbe35a808da0b36b5c1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637834626843314349%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=UJnGWwcGkxhyXYJVv2QYGF%2Foq2BxUIKInZ1Ig747DxE%3D&reserved=0). Hunters should confirm that they are not hunting on illegally seized land or on a nature conservancy as you may be subject to arrest, lawsuits, fines, seizure of possessions, and imprisonment. You should also contact the Embassy of Zimbabwe in Washington, D.C. to determine what permits are required by the Government of Zimbabwe for importing weapons into the country.

**LGB Travelers:** The constitution of Zimbabwe outlaws marriage between people of the same sex and allows for discrimination based on sexual orientation. Consensual sex between men is criminalized in Zimbabwe, with both parties subject to fines of 5,000 USD or a year imprisonment or both. While there is no explicit legal prohibition against sexual relations between women, societal violence and harassment against LGB individuals is pervasive. See our LGB Travel Information page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Zimbabwe prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Accessible facilities, transportation, and communications are extremely rare. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. *Contact the US Embassy in Zimbabwe to receive a list of providers.*
