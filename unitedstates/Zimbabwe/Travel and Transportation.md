**Road Conditions and Safety:**Driving in Zimbabwe is hazardous. Zimbabweans drive on the left side of the road and people often drive over the speed limit. Avoid driving at night. The Traffic Safety Council reports there are 40-50 vehicle accidents in Harare every night. Car seats for children are uncommon. Although the main highways throughout Zimbabwe are generally in fair but deteriorating condition, most lack passing lanes, shoulders, breakdown lanes, lighting, reflectors, and similar safety features. Secondary roads are normally in very poor condition.

Hazards you will encounter while driving (especially after dark):

* Pedestrians (in dark clothing) and animals walking along or on the roads.
* Motor vehicles with no headlights or taillights.
* Restricted visibility when passing.
* Faded lane markers and non-working streetlights and traffic lights.
* Service stations lacking fuel and spare parts.
* Numerous potholes.

There is no national network of roadside emergency service. However, the Automobile Association (AA) of Zimbabwe is willing to provide roadside emergency service to nonmembers for a fee. They can be contacted at +263-4-788-173. AA Zimbabwe’s 24-hour emergency roadside helpline is +263-4-776-760 or +263-712-406-033. Travelers can also contact the Road Angels, another roadside assistance service, at +263-4-334-304 and +263-4-334-418.

**Traffic Laws:** It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving in Zimbabwe. Drivers are required to wear seat belts or helmets if driving motorcycles. Car seats are not legally required for small children. Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) enforcement does not generally exist, resulting in high rates of impaired drivers, especially at night.

**Public Transportation:** The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using “Kombis” – the minibuses that service main routes – due to safety concerns. Inter-city commuter bus travel, except on “luxury coaches,” is dangerous due to overcrowding, inadequate maintenance, and unsafe drivers. Public bus drivers are often fatigued, fail to adhere to local speed limits, and often fail to obey traffic rules or regulations.

**Air Travel:** The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using the national carrier, Air Zimbabwe, due to safety concerns. Several other regional airlines offer services, but flights can be subject to unannounced schedule changes.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Zimbabwe, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Zimbabwe’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
