**Reissued after periodic review with updates to crime and civil unrest information.**

Exercise increased caution in Zimbabwe due to**crime and official harassment of U.S. citizens.**

**Country Summary**: Opportunistic crime, such as pickpocketing, theft, and smashing of car windows with intent to steal, is common. Violent crime, such as assault, carjacking, and home invasion, also occurs. Criminals often target foreigners and residents suspected of having large sums of cash.

Demonstrations may occur and increase in frequency around political events, such as elections. Large gatherings are often restricted by the government and can quickly escalate to violence.

Foreigners, journalists, and non-governmental organizations may be subject to heightened scrutiny in Zimbabwe.
