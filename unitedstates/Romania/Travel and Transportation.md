**Road Conditions and Safety:** Though Romanian traffic laws are very strict, road accidents are a real threat in Romania. According to the [European Commission,](https://road-safety.transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/road-safety-eu-fatalities-2021-remain-well-below-pre-pandemic-level-2022-03-28_en) Romania has the highest per-vehicle rate of road fatalities of any country in the EU.

While major streets in larger cities and major inter-city roads are generally in fair to good condition, many secondary roads are poor quality unpaved, poorly lit, narrow, and lacking marked lanes.

* Mountain roads are dangerous when wet or covered with snow or ice. Snow removal is intermittent.
* Mountainous areas can be subject to torrential rains and flash floods, especially in the spring and summer.
* Streets and sidewalks are often icy and hazardous during winter.
* It is common for pedestrians, animals, cyclists, and horse-drawn carts to share a road with motor vehicles, especially in rural areas.
* Parked vehicles often block sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to walk in the streets.
* Cross only at crosswalks and exercise vigilance as crosswalks are generally poorly marked.
* Although emergency services and road assistance services exist, it is advisable to carry spare tires, fuel and tools. The law requires motorists to carry a first aid kit, fire extinguisher and reflective triangles. This obligation has been eliminated for motorcycles and mopeds.

**Traffic Laws:** Romanian traffic laws are very strict.

* The traffic police can confiscate a driver's license or permit for 1-3 months and request payment of fines at the time of the infraction.
* Police are required to give all drivers involved in an accident a breathalyzer test on the scene.
* Refusal to take a breathalyzer test may result in criminal penalties regardless of whether or not alcohol was involved.
* Wearing a seat belt is mandatory.
* Children under 12 years of age may not be transported in the front seat.
* Use of mobile phones while driving is banned, with exception of hands free systems.
* The driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in death or injury of a person must immediately call the emergency number 112, and must not move the vehicle, alter or leave the scene of the accident.
* In the case of an accident that only caused damage to the vehicles, drivers must move the vehicles to the side of the road, signaling their presence, and report the accident to the police or exchange insurance information and fill out an amicable accident report.

Use of U.S. state issued drivers’ licenses (DL) is not sufficient to operate motor vehicles in Romania.  U.S. citizens arriving in Romania for stays up to 90 days may use their U.S. state drivers’ licenses only when accompanied by **an International Driving Permit**. Most rental car companies require international driving permits when renting a car to a U.S. driver’s license holder.

If entering Romania by vehicle you must purchase a road tax badge, “rovinieta”, at the border crossing point. Proof of insurance and a car registration document are required. Drivers of vehicles registered abroad who are not in possession of a valid international insurance document must buy short-term insurance at the border.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in Romania is inexpensive and reliable. Inner city travel options include a variety of buses, trams, trolleybuses, and “maxitaxis” (private vans operating as shared taxis).

* You can purchase bus or tram tickets at street kiosks before boarding and validate the ticket once aboard.
* For “maxitaxis” you may buy a ticket directly from the driver.
