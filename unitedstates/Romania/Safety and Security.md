# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Reported types of crime include:

* Robbery, pick pocketing, internet scams, and credit card fraud are the most commonly reported crimes.
* Organized groups of criminals, sometimes including minors, operate in train stations, trains, subways, and busses.
* Money exchange schemes often involve individuals posing as plainclothes policemen who approach you, flash a badge, and ask for your passport and wallet. Insist on the presence of a uniformed police officer and request that any issues be resolved at the police station.
* If traveling on an overnight train, travel with a companion and in the highest class available.
* Do not leave your personal belongings unattended; stow them securely out of sight.
* Use ATMs located inside banks. You should check ATM machines for any evidence of tampering before use.
* Be extra cautious of your surroundings if using an internet café.

Be cautious about entering into contracts with Romanian businesses and/or organizations without legal assistance. The Romanian legal system is difficult for foreigners to navigate, making the assistance of a [local attorney](https://ro.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/attorneys/) nearly essential.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Romania. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Lotteries
* Bank overpayments

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the embassy at (+40) 21 270-6000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

* Romania is situated in a seismically active region and has a history of devastating earthquakes, with the greatest risk in Bucharest.
