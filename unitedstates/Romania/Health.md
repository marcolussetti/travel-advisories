Medical care in Romania is generally not up to Western standards, and basic medical supplies are limited, especially outside major cities. Some medical providers that meet Western quality standards are available in Bucharest and other cities but can be difficult to identify and locate.

Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.  Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Travelers seeking medical treatment should therefore choose their provider carefully.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited outside of the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

Most prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications are available in Romania but are often sold under different names. A list of approved medicines available in Romania can be found on the website of the [Romanian National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices](https://nomenclator.anm.ro/medicamente).

Ambulance services are not present throughout the country and are unreliable in some areas except in or around major cities.

**We do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Romanian National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices](https://nomenclator.anm.ro/medicamente) to ensure the medication is legal in Romania.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Romania.  Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.
