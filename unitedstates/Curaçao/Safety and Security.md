# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**Crimes of opportunity are common, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at beaches, hotel lobbies, or from cars. Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to secure personal property. Car theft is an increasing problem. Do not leave valuables in cars in plain view or unattended in unsecured hotel rooms and rental homes. Parking lots that are unattended and without access control are considered higher risk for car break-ins. Some beaches charge a fee for access and employ private security, which provides some deterrent to crime.

Keep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case your passport is stolen.

Violent crime, including rape and armed robbery – although not common – does occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island. Some thefts and assaults have been reported near nature areas, remote beaches, and small or informal parking areas used by divers.

If you are traveling with children, be aware that the legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate.  Take standard precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars. Travel in pairs or groups and, if you consume alcohol, do so responsibly.

**Victims of Crime:** Dial 911 for police assistance in Curaçao. Contact the U.S. Consulate at +(599)(9) 461-3066 after you have contacted local police. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

Do not rely on hotels, restaurants, or tour companies to make the police report for you.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
