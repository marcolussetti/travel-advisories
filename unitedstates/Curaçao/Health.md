Access to quality medical care is limited in Curaçao, and facilities do not offer the health and service standards typically expected in the United States.

For emergency services in Curaçao, dial:

* Police: 911
* Ambulance/EMS: 912
* Fire Department: 911
* Coastal Guard: 913

Ambulance services are widely available.

Curaçao’s medical system emphasizes the use of “house doctors” or “huisarts,” outpatient primary care physicians who may not have completed postgraduate training such as a residency program. Some surgical specialties, e.g., neurosurgery and cardiac surgery, are not represented on the island.

St. Elisabeth Hospital (SEHOS) is the largest hospital in Curaçao with an extensive emergency room and the only intensive care unit on the island. Curaçao also has two private clinics, The [Curacao Medical Center (CMC)](https://adventhospital.com/)

A [list of medical facilities](https://cw.usconsulate.gov/medical-assistance/) in Curaçao is available on our Consulate website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Critically ill patients requiring service not offered in Curaçao are normally transferred to Colombia at the patient’s expense. If medical evacuation is authorized by the patient’s insurance carrier or funded privately (approximately $15,000 – $25,000), patients can be transferred to the United States.

**Medicines:** If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Government of Curaçao](https://www.curacao.com/en/directory/plan/getting-curacao/customs-and-immigration/)to ensure the medication is legal in Curaçao.  Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

The variety of drugs available locally is smaller than in the U.S. To find out which local pharmacy is open after hours, you can call (+599)(9)737-7404 or check with your hotel.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The following diseases are prevalent:

* [Zika Virus](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html)
* [Dengue](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/)
* [Chikungunya](https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/index.html)

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
