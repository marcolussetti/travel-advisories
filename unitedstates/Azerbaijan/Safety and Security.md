# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, vehicles and rudimentary IEDs– to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**The Nagorno-Karabakh Area and Conflict:**

* **The U.S. Government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.**
* Exercise caution near the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Despite the declaration of a cessation in hostilities, the danger posed by intermittent gunfire, land mines, and poor road conditions continue. **Roads near the conflict zone may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice**.
* For more information regarding business and commercial activities in these areas, please visit the [Investment Climate Statement](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-investment-climate-statements/azerbaijan/).

**U.S. citizens of Armenian descent may encounter anti-Armenian sentiments in Azerbaijan.**

**Exercise caution in the region of Nardaran**, located approximately 28 miles (45 km) from Baku on the Absheron Peninsula. Nardaran is culturally conservative and has been the site of several **anti-United States** and **anti-Israel** protests. It has also been the subject of government raids, which have sometimes resulted in violence.

**Crime:** Crime is relatively low and violent crime is infrequent. The majority of reported crimes involve **burglary, assault**, or **petty crime** such as **pickpocketing**.

* Be careful in areas that attract large crowds or are very isolated. Criminals have targeted foreigners walking alone, late at night, or under the influence of alcohol.
* Some women have reported incidents of unwanted male attention while walking alone and taking taxis. **Sexual assault** may be underreported due to cultural stigma.
* **Financial scams** are increasingly common. While the majority involves internet dating, there are reports of scams related to fraudulent real estate deals, licensing requirements, and travel advertisements.
* There are reports of increased **credit and bank card fraud**, such as [credit card skimming.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/atm-skimming)

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI pages](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) for information on scams.

**Avoid demonstrations and riots,** which police have previously suppressed with force**. Demonstrations** occur periodically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizens who are victims of crime should report crimes to the local police and then contact the U.S. Embassy. Contact the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+994 12) 488 3300. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in Baku. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of Baku and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
