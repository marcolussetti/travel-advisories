# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Human Rights Concerns:** Be aware of ongoing human rights concerns in Azerbaijan, including reports of arbitrary arrests, restrictions on freedom of expression, and mistreatment of detainees. Journalists and activists may face harassment and imprisonment. Stay informed about local laws and respect local customs to avoid any legal issues. For more detailed information, please refer to the U.S. State Department's Travel Advisory for Azerbaijan.

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship

The former Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and surrounding territories **and Armenia Border Areas:**

* **The U.S. Government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in and around the former Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast area and surrounding territories as access is restricted.**
* Exercise caution near the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Despite the declaration of a cessation in hostilities, the danger posed by intermittent gunfire, land mines, and poor road conditions continues. Roads near the border may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice.

**U.S. citizens of Armenian descent may encounter anti-Armenian sentiments in Azerbaijan.**

**Crime:** Crime is relatively low and violent crime is infrequent. Most reported crimes involve burglary, assault, or petty crime such as pickpocketing.

* Some women have reported incidents of unwanted male attention while walking alone and taking taxis. Sexual assault may be underreported due to cultural stigma.

**International Financial Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Azerbaijan. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. There are reports of scams related to fraudulent real estate deals, licensing requirements, and travel advertisements. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Demonstrations** are rare but may be suppressed with force when they occur. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +994-12-488-3300. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on help for [U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near Baku. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
