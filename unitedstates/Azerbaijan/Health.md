For emergency medical services in Azerbaijan, **dial 103**.

Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are typically not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas

We strongly recommend you obtain [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Embassy of Azerbaijan](https://washington.mfa.gov.az/en) or the [State Customs Committee](https://customs.gov.az/en) to ensure the medication is legal in Azerbaijan.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-for-work-other-reasons/medical-tourism) for more information on Medical Tourism.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

If travelers must bring such medications, they should bring diagnosis and prescription paperwork from a licensed practitioner in the United States.
