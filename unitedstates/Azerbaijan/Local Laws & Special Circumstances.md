# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You can be legally detained in jail for up to four months during an investigation. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. There are often delays in consular notification after arrests of U.S. citizens. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Restrictions on Photography:**It is illegal to take photographs of military installations and equipment. Police may stop you even if you take photographs of non-military sites, like oil fields, buildings, and public squares. Cooperate with the police.

**Military Service**: Azerbaijan has mandatory military service for male citizens ages 18 to 35. If Azerbaijan considers you a citizen, you could face fines or arrest if you have not completed your military service. Dual citizen males ages 18 to 35 have been prevented from departing Azerbaijan on U.S. or Azerbaijan passports – until they resolved military service requirements with the Azerbaijan government. The U.S. Embassy in Baku cannot resolve this issue for affected individuals. Information regarding Azerbaijan’s mandatory military service, including contact information, can be found on Azerbaijan’s State Service for Mobilization and Conscription [website](https://seferberlik.gov.az/az). Information about renouncing Azerbaijani citizenship is available through the [Embassy of Azerbaijan](https://washington.mfa.gov.az/en/content/270/revocation-from-citizenship-of-azerbaijan).

**Drones:** Azerbaijan does not allow the import of drones without prior authorization. Drones brought into the country without authorization are subject to confiscation by customs officials.

**Customs:** Taking carpets, artwork, and other cultural artifacts out of the country requires an export certificate. Consult the seller or the Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum for assistance.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**LGB individuals are not specifically protected by antidiscrimination laws. Societal intolerance, discrimination, and violence based on sexual orientation remain a problem in Azerbaijan. It is not illegal to organize events in support of LGB persons, but societal intolerance generally prevented these events. LGB individuals have reported that employers sometimes found other reasons to fire LGB employees due to their sexual orientation. One of the main concerns for local LGB persons is the perceived failure of law enforcement agencies to act on violations of the rights of LGB persons and indifference to investigating crimes committed against LGB persons in Azerbaijan. The Department of State’s Human Rights Report documents incidents of police brutality against individuals based on sexual orientation and notes that authorities did not investigate or punish those responsible.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: Azerbaijani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but accessibility for persons with disabilities is limited throughout the country. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure.
