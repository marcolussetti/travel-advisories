# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start

* You can be legally detained for up to 4 days before being charged.
* Depending on the charges, you may remain in detention for up to 19 months during a pre-trial investigation.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. There are often delays in consular notification after arrests of U.S. citizens in Azerbaijan. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Restrictions on Photography:**It is illegal to take photographs of military installations and equipment. Police may stop you even if you take photographs of non-military sites, like oil fields, buildings, and public squares. Cooperate with the police.

**Military Service**: Military service is mandatory in Azerbaijan for male citizens ages 18 to 30. If Azerbaijan considers you a citizen, you could face fines or arrest if you have not completed your military service. Dual citizen males ages 18 to 30 have been prevented from departing Azerbaijan on U.S. or Azerbaijan passports until they resolved military service requirements with the Azerbaijan government. The Embassy cannot resolve this issue for affected individuals. For information regarding Azerbaijan’s mandatory military service, including contact information, see Azerbaijan’s State Service for Mobilization and Conscription [website](https://seferberlik.gov.az/az). Information about renouncing Azerbaijani citizenship is available at the [Embassy of Azerbaijan](https://washington.mfa.gov.az/en/content/270/revocation-from-citizenship-of-azerbaijan).

**Drones:**Azerbaijan does not allow the import of drones without prior authorization. Drones brought into the country without authorization are subject to confiscation by customs officials.

**Customs:** Taking carpets, artwork, and other cultural artifacts out of the country requires an export certificate. Consult the seller or the Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum for assistance.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. Review the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers**: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of events inAzerbaijan. However, persons may face discrimination, harassment, and violence on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation. Reports indicate that authorities have rarely investigated, prosecuted, or punished those for violence targeting persons on the basis of sexual orientation. There are some limits on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly regarding matters related to sexual orientation due in part to societal stigma.

Review our [Gay and Lesbian Traveler Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) and [section 6 of our Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Azerbaijan prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but accessibility for persons with disabilities is limited throughout the country. Expect accessibility to be limited in transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure.
