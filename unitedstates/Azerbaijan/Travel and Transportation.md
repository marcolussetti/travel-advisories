**Road Conditions and Safety:** The information below is provided for general reference only.

* Road conditions in Azerbaijan differ significantly from those in the United States. Exercise caution when driving in Azerbaijan.
* Reckless driving is very common. Many drivers do not pay attention to traffic regulations, signals, lane markings, pedestrians, or other drivers. Drivers often travel at extremely high speeds, and accidents are frequent and often serious.
* Older sections of the roadway system are poorly constructed and poorly lit. Many rural roads are largely unpaved. Driving hazards, such as open manholes, debris, and potholes are common in Baku.
* Unfinished road sections may be extremely dangerous due to lack of proper construction and hazard signage.
* Watch out for pedestrians. Pedestrians routinely disregard vehicles, crosswalks, signs and signals, and in general act carelessly.
* Exercise caution on roads near the border with Armenia. Be aware that some portions of the road may cross international boundaries without notice. Roads may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice.

**Traffic Laws:**Vehicles drive on the right.Routine traffic stops are common. If you are driving, keep all required documents with you, including passport or local registration documents, driver’s license, vehicle registration documents, and proof of insurance.

* Foreigners residing in Azerbaijan for more than 30 days must obtain a local driver’s license through [ASAN Xidmet](https://asan.gov.az/en).
* Azerbaijan has strict laws about driving under the influence of alcohol. It is illegal to drive with any measurable amount of alcohol in your system.

**Public Transportation:**

* The Baku metro system is an inexpensive option for transportation. Security cameras provide excellent coverage of all metro platforms throughout the system. There are police units at each metro station, and bag checks may be carried out at the entrance to each station.
* Because safety and licensing standards do not match those found in the United States, **U.S. Embassy personnel are not authorized to use public buses.**
* For safety, we recommend using only **marked taxis** if you choose to take one.
* Public transportation throughout the rest of the country remains **overcrowded** and **poorly maintained**.
