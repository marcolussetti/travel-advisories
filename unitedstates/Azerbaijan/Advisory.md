**If you decide to travel to Azerbaijan:**

* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report) for Azerbaijan.
* Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel and return to the United States.

Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.

**Level 4: Do Not Travel - Border with Armenia**  
There is the potential for fighting along the Azerbaijan-Armenia border.  U.S. citizens should avoid the area.

Exercise caution on roads near Azerbaijan’s border with Armenia:

* Be aware that some portions of the road may cross international boundaries without notice.
* Roads may be controlled by checkpoints or closed to travelers without notice.
* Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Azerbaijan are prohibited from non-essential travel to the border region.

**Level 4: Do Not Travel - Former Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and surrounding territories**

Following armed hostilities in 2023, the former Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and surrounding territories are under the control of Azerbaijan.  Despite the cessation of fighting, the dangers posed by landmine contamination continue.  Due to the risks, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the former Soviet-era Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and surrounding territories, because U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there and Azerbaijan restricts access to the region.
