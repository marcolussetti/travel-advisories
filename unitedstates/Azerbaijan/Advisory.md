**Reissued after periodic review with general security updates.**

Exercise increased caution in Azerbaijan due to **terrorism concerns and areas of armed conflict**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Do not travel to:

* The border region with Armenia.
* The **Nagorno-Karabakh** region and surrounding territories due to recent hostilities.

**Country Summary:** Terrorist groups that continue to plot attacks pose a risk in Azerbaijan. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.

Until September 2020 the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding territories were under Armenian control. Following armed hostilities in the fall of 2020 and fall of 2023, Azerbaijan took control of these seven territories and Nagorno-Karabakh. Further military activity could occur in the region.
