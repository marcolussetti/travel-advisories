# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions are poor. Night driving is particularly dangerous due to the absence of lighting and terrorist- or militia-operated checkpoints. Other risks include lack of traffic lights and pedestrians and animals in the road. Refer to our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from traveling outside the AAIA compound or using public transportation due to safety concerns.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Somalia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

The FAA has issued a Notice to Air Mission containing information on the U.S. prohibition against U.S. civil aviation operations in airspace over Somalia. For background information and advisories consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).

The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using commercial airlines originating from or arriving in Somalia due to safety concerns.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners and passengers planning travel to Somalia should check for [U.S. Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). The [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website may also provide relevant information.

**Port Security:** The U.S. Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Somalia’s ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108. Mariners and passengers traveling through Somalian ports should exercise caution and implement enhanced security measures.
