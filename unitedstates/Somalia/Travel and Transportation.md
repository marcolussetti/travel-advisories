# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions are poor. Night driving is particularly dangerous due to the absence of lighting and terrorist- or militia-operated checkpoints. Other risks include lack of traffic lights and pedestrians and animals in the road. Refer to our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from traveling outside the AAIA compound or using public transportation due to safety concerns.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Somalia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Somalia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

The FAA has issued a Notice to Air Mission containing information on the U.S. prohibition against U.S. civil aviation operations in airspace over Somalia. For background information and advisories consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using commercial airlines originating from or arriving in Somalia due to safety concerns.

**Maritime Travel:** Information may be posted at [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts), [the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration](http://www.marad.dot.gov/), the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

**Port Security:** The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Somalia ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.”
