# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of a permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region. U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. In an emergency, you will have to rely on your own resources or journey to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate outside of Somalia.

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by foreigners
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including buses and scheduled commercial flights)
* Checkpoints

Terrorist organizations and armed groups in Somalia attack government authorities and facilities; African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel and bases; and civilian and non-governmental targets, including but not limited to hotels, restaurants, airports, seaports, and shopping areas. Inter-clan and factional violence are also regular occurrences throughout Somalia.

Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa’ida-affiliated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, has repeatedly attacked Mogadishu’s Aden Adde International Airport (AAIA) and other locations in Somalia with mortars, small arms and light weapons, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The group’s recent attacks include a March 23, 2022, small arms and mortar attack at the AAIA compound in Mogadishu, where the U.S. Embassy, several other diplomatic posts, and the UN offices are based, which killed seven people. Later the same day, two attacks in Beledweyne killed 48 and wounded 108. On January 12, 2022, a VBIED motorcade attack approximately four kilometers from the U.S. Embassy injured two U.S. citizen contractors and killed five non-U.S. citizen employees providing security and killed an unconfirmed number of bystanders. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for all of these attacks. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, where there have been no major terrorist attacks since 2008, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning.

**Crime:** Violent crime such as kidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur throughout Somalia, including the self-declared autonomous region of Somaliland. Somali authorities have limited capacity and resources to investigate and prosecute criminal activity.

U.S. citizens should:

* Avoid walking alone, especially at night.
* Avoid displaying cash and valuable personal property.
* Dress conservatively.
* Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa. Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Maintain caution in areas frequented by foreigners.
* Be cautious when traveling in major cities and along border areas.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Cultural Rehabilitation Centers:** Some schools and other facilities acting as “cultural rehabilitation” centers are operating in Somalia with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their will and physically abused are common.

**Somalia-Kenya Border:** Cross-border violence attributed to al-Shabaab and skirmishes between the Somali and Kenyan armies occurs periodically, including large-scale attacks against civilians, government security forces, and AMISOM troops. Kidnapping, IED, and grenade attacks targeting international aid workers and civilians occur. Al-Shabaab actively operates in border areas, including Kenya’s Lamu and Wajir counties.
