* Motorists entering a roundabout must yield to those already in it;
* All passengers are required to wear seat belts; and
* Laws against driving while intoxicated are strictly enforced, with a legal maximum blood alcohol level set at 70 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood (equivalent to a .07 blood/alcohol level in the United States).
