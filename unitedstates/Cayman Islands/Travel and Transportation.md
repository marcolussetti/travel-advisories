[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Vehicles in the Cayman Islands travel on the left-hand side of the road.

**Traffic Laws:** You must obtain a temporary driver’s license at a car rental agency or police station by presenting a valid U.S. driver’s license and paying a small fee.

* Traffic circles (“roundabouts”) are often poorly marked and require traffic to move in a clockwise direction;
* Motorists entering a roundabout must yield to those already in it;
* All passengers are required to wear seat belts; and
* Laws against driving while intoxicated are strictly enforced, with a legal maximum blood alcohol level set at 100 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood (equivalent to a .10 blood/alcohol level in the United States).
