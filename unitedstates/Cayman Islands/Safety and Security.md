# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Cayman Islands are a safe place with little criminal activity affecting tourists.

**Crime:**Crime of opportunity such as pick-pocketing and purse snatchings occasionally occur. Police in the Cayman Islands enforce laws against illegal drugs, guns and ammunition.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 911 (the local equivalent of “911” in the U.S.) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +1-876-702-6000.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

These are some of the things the Embassy can do for you as a crime victim:

* help you find appropriate medical care
* assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* explain the local criminal justice process in general terms
* provide a list of local attorneys
* provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* replace a stolen or lost passport

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 911.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and the regularity and quality of safety inspections vary widely by industry and attraction.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only on Grand Cayman, with limited care available on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. First responders are generally unable to access the smaller islands to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
