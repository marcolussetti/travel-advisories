# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Cayman Islands have low rates of criminal activity affecting tourists.

**Crime:**Crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing and purse snatchings occasionally occur. Police in the Cayman Islands enforce laws against illegal drugs, guns and ammunition.

**Scams:** See the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 911 (the local equivalent of “911” in the U.S.) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +1-876-702-6000.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

These are some of the things the Embassy can do for you as a crime victim:

* Help you find appropriate medical care
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent
* Provide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys. We do not endorse or recommend any specific attorneys.
* Provide information on [victim’s compensation programs in the United States.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html)
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home
* Replace a stolen or lost passport

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 911.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections differ greatly by industry and attraction. Hazardous areas and activities often lack proper signage. Staff might not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get hurt, you can usually find medical help on Grand Cayman. Care on Cayman Brac and Little Cayman is limited. First responders often cannot reach the smaller islands. This makes it hard for them to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html). Review our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.
