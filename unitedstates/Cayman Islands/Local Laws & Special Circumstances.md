# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to the laws of the Cayman Islands while you are here. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Common reasons for arrest include:

* Carrying ammunition and firearms into the Cayman Islands. (Even a single bullet inadvertently loose in a carry-on bag can lead to arrest.)
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants.
* Buying, selling, holding or taking illegal drugs under any circumstances.

**Firearms:** You are strictly forbidden to import or possess firearms in the Cayman Islands.

* A Conceal Carry Permit, employment by a police agency, or service in U.S. Armed Forces does NOT allow you to bring a firearm or ammunition into the Cayman Islands.
* If you travel with firearms, firearm components & parts and/or ammunition to the Cayman Islands, you will be arrested and referred to the local courts for prosecution which will result in a substantial fine and/or incarceration for an unspecified amount of time.

**Customs:** Please see the [Cayman Islands Customs](https://www.cbc.gov.ky/) portal for comprehensive customs information.

Common prohibited items are as follows:

* Importing: Firearms, ammunition, spear guns, pole spears, Hawaiian slings, plants and plant cuttings, raw fruits and vegetables.
* Exporting or transshipping: sea turtle products.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the [Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in the Cayman Islands.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: While in the Cayman Islands, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States.

* The Cayman Islands lack comprehensive disability legislation, and, while many hotels and resorts are well-equipped for disabled guests, other tourist facilities, such as the airport and the cruise ship dock, are much less so.
