**Medical Care:** The quality of medical care in the Cayman Islands is generally comparable to that available in the United States, but some procedures and cases requiring critical care may require medical evacuation to the United States. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate payment for health services.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Snorkeling/SCUBA Diving:** Each year, U.S. citizens drown or suffer cardiac arrest while snorkeling or SCUBA diving in the Cayman Islands. Remember:

Be honest with your instructor or the dive shop if you have a pre-existing medical condition that could be exacerbated when snorkeling or diving; and

Check that a hyperbaric chamber is available for treatment of decompression illness.

**Emergency Services:** Emergency response services are available in the Cayman Islands.

**The following diseases are prevalent:** [Zika Virus](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html), [Chikungunya](http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/), [Dengue Fever](http://www.cdc.gov/Dengue/).

Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby, as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. Zika outbreaks have been reported on Curacao. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html).

Chikunguya and Dengue are mosquito-borne illnesses that are becoming more frequent in tropical and equatorial climates around the world. Preventing mosquito bites is the most important way to prevent these illnesses. Travelers should carry and use [CDC recommended insect repellents](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/the-pre-travel-consultation/protection-against-mosquitoes-ticks-other-arthropods).

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
