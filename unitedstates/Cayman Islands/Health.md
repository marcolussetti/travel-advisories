**Medical Care:** Medical care in the Cayman Islands is usually on par with that in the United States, though availability can be limited on the smaller islands. Most emergency medical needs can be served on Grand Cayman. Some critical cases may require medical evacuation to the United States. Emergency and routine medical services on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac are limited. Some critical cases might need evacuation to the United States for treatment. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate payment for health services.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on [insurance coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Snorkeling/SCUBA Diving:** Each year, U.S. citizens drown or suffer cardiac arrest while snorkeling or SCUBA diving in the Cayman Islands. Remember:

* Be honest with your instructor or the dive shop if you have a pre-existing medical condition that could be exacerbated when snorkeling or diving; and
* Check that a hyperbaric chamber is available for treatment of decompression illness.

**Emergency Services:** Emergency response services are available in the Cayman Islands. Dial 911.

**The following diseases are prevalent:** [Zika Virus](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html), [Chikungunya](https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html), [Dengue Fever](https://www.cdc.gov/Dengue/).

Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can be spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby, as well as through sexual contact. The CDC has concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects in some fetuses and babies born to infected mothers. Zika outbreaks have been reported on Curacao. For additional information about Zika, including travel advisories, visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html).

Chikunguya and Dengue are mosquito-borne illnesses that are becoming more frequent in tropical and equatorial climates around the world. Preventing mosquito bites is the most important way to prevent these illnesses. Travelers should carry and use [CDC recommended insect repellents](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/environmental-hazards-risks/mosquitoes-ticks-and-other-arthropods).

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
