Exercise increased caution in Botswana due to crime.

**Country Summary:** Crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common in Botswana.  Potentially violent crimes, such as home invasions, break-ins, “smash and grabs” from vehicles stopped at intersections and from locked cars in shopping mall parking lots, cell phone thefts, and muggings are routinely reported to police.
