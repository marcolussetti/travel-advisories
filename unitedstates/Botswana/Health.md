For emergency services in Botswana, dial 999 for the Police, 998 for Fire, and 992 for Ambulance (MRI).

Ambulance services are:

* widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

Adequately equipped private medical facilities, emergency rooms, and trained physicians are available in Gaborone for simple medical problems but services are rudimentary elsewhere. Ability to pay for care must be established before you will receive medical care. More advanced care is available in South Africa. Many South African manufactured prescription drugs are available in Gaborone, although there have been recent shortages of routine prescription drugs.

Avoid drinking tap water and ice made from tap water. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe to drink.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Botswana Medicines Regulatory Authority](https://www.bomra.co.bw/) to ensure the medication is legal in Botswana.

Check with the government of [Botswana](https://www.bomra.co.bw/)to ensure the medication you are carrying is legal in Botswana. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Health facilities in general:**

Adequate health facilities are available in Gaborone and other major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.

Hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.

Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.

Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-the-extreme) for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Botswana.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Although Botswana has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities thatare on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Botswana, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/buying-medicine-outside-united-states) are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Non-Traditional Medicine:**U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Botswana. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Botswana, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Botswana. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same-sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Botswana courts.

**Water Quality:**In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel**

**General Health Language:**

* The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents, sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets, and wearing protective clothing in [certain areas](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prophylaxis-information-by-country/). Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for travelers going to [certain areas](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prophylaxis-information-by-country/) of Botswana take prescription medicine to prevent malaria, even for short stays.
* HIV/AIDS: Botswana has high HIV prevalence. Travelers are at low risk unless they engage in risky practices, such as unprotected sex or sharing needles. Prevention information is available at [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Traveler’s Health/HIV](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/hiv).
* There have recently been shortages of routine medications reported throughout Botswana.
* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/resources-for-travelers) regarding specific issues in Botswana.

**Air Quality:**

* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst in the winter months of May-September. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
