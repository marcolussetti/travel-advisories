# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

On August 28, 2022 the Government of Botswana announced that the wearing of masks, proof of vaccination, and testing at port of entry for unvaccinated travelers is no longer required in Botswana. A negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) is not required and there are no health screening procedures at airports and other ports of entry.

A passport with at least six months of validity remaining is required. U.S. citizens are permitted stays up to 90 days total within a 12-month period without a visa. The total stay permitted for each visit is recorded on the entry stamp by Botswana immigration officials and may be less than 90 days. Travelers who attempt to enter Botswana with a temporary passport **must have a visa to enter**. Visas cannot be obtained upon arrival in Botswana, and U.S. citizens without a visa in a temporary passport will face fines and long administrative delays.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Botswana. However, [students beginning their studies](https://www.hivtravel.org/Default.aspx?PageId=143&CountryId=32)at the University of Botswana are required to take an HIV test.

**Residency Applicants and Document Certification for Botswana**

Original or certified copies of one’s birth and marriage certificates are required for residency applications, per Botswana’s Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs [website](https://www.govpage.co.za/botswana-labour--home-affairs.html). U.S. citizens applying for residency in Botswana should have their birth and marriage certificates apostilled by the U.S. state where the documents were issued before coming to Botswana.

Only the Secretary of State in the State where the birth or marriage certificates were issued is authorized to apostille those documents. A list of these authorities in each state can be found on the [Hague website](https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=353). Teachers moving to Botswana to teach should contact the issuing educational institution registrar’s office to obtain certified copies of their transcripts.

Please see also the [Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/apostille-requirements.html) regarding the types of documents that can and cannot be authenticated by the U.S. Embassy.
