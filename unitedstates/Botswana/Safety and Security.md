# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**CRIME:**  Non-confrontational crime and crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common. Home invasions, break-ins, “smash and grabs” from vehicles at intersections and from locked cars in shopping mall parking lots, cell phone thefts, and muggings - often at knife point, are routinely reported to police. Hotels and lodges are not immune from criminal activity. Visitors should remain alert and take reasonable precautions to safeguard personal property (particularly money and electronic equipment). Crime is also reported in game parks, nature reserves, and remote areas frequented by tourists.

You should:

* avoid walking alone, particularly at night
* exercise caution near Kgale Hill (a popular hiking site) in Gaborone due to frequent criminal incidents;
* promptly comply if confronted by criminals as resistance may result in severe injury;
* avoid crowds, political rallies, and demonstrations;
* always maintain security awareness.

Travelers arriving in Botswana via South Africa should be aware of serious and continuing baggage pilferage problems at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) and Cape Town International Airports. It is suggested that you:

* use an airport plastic wrapping service;
* avoid placing valuables in checked luggage;
* make an inventory of items in checked baggage to file claims if theft does occur;
* if asked to gate check a piece of hand luggage, transfer high value items and prescription drugs into a carry-on bag.

Travelers transiting and staying overnight in Johannesburg before departing for Botswana should exercise vigilance when departing the airport as foreigners have been the victims of “follow home” robberies.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry in Botswana is unevenly regulated. Many tourism operators provide top quality equipment and facilities; however, authorities conduct annual safety inspections for equipment and facilities inconsistently. Hazardous areas/activities are often, but not always, identified with appropriate signage, and some staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available in the capital, Gaborone, and in the cities of Maun, Francistown, and Kasane. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of the capital and to provide medical treatment, however there may be delays reaching remote areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
