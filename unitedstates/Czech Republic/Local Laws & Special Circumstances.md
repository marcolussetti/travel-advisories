# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Ensure the security of your passport and other valuables to prevent incidents of pickpocketing or theft.
* Always carry your passport. Czech Police, customs, or immigration officials can request to see your passport at any time. You may be fined if you fail to produce your passport.
* Keep a **copy of your passport** bio data page (and pages with valid visas) in a safe place, separate from the passport itself.
* Czech **customs** authorities enforce **strict regulations** concerning temporary import or export of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, etc. Contact the [Embassy of the Czech Republic in Washington, D.C.](https://www.mzv.cz/washington/en/consular_information/index.html), for further customs guidance. The U.S. Embassy cannot help clear goods through Czech customs or advise on what items can or cannot be imported to the Czech Republic.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* The sale, possession, or use of **illicit drugs** is against the law in the Czech Republic.
* The Czech Republic has a strictly enforced, zero-tolerance policy for **drinking and driving**.
* Local police can require you to produce identification to establish your identity upon request and submit you to further questioning.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. If you bring them back to the United States you could be subject to fines and may have to relinquish them prior to entering the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Czech Republic. Outside of Prague, particularly in small towns, such relations or events are less accepted. LGB travelers should use **discretion** when traveling in these areas. Seeour [LGB travel information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html)page and section six of the [Department of State’s Human Rights Report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: While in the Czech Republic, individuals may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of other state services. The government generally enforces these provisions.

* Many buses and streetcars - especially in Prague - are configured for special needs access.
* 72 percent of Prague’s metro stations are accessible to persons with disabilities, and work to expand barrier-free access is ongoing.
* Taxi services for persons with limited mobility exist. There are several companies offering such services in Prague, and some service areas outside Prague.
* Much of the center of Prague, most interesting to tourists, was built centuries ago with narrow cobblestone streets that may make accessibility difficult or impossible.
* Accessibility outside of Prague is generally less available.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:**

* Be aware of **“date-rape” drugs**.
* Be cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served. Leaving your **drink unattended** or accepting a drink from a stranger can lead to serious consequences.
