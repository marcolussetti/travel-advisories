**For emergency services in Czech Republic, dial 112.**

Prague has **adequate** Western-style medical clinics with English-speaking doctors and dentists, but its system is organized differently than in the United States. Though central emergency rooms exist in most hospitals, patients are often sent to a specialty clinic to treat specific medical conditions. Family practices like those in the United States are mostly in larger cities.

* All major hospitals accept **credit cards** or cash as a method of payment. Private specialists usually expect **cash**, though some private facilities accept credit cards.

In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. **Ambulance** services are on par with those in the United States. Response time is usually less than 15 minutes. Ambulance companies generally expect **payment** at the time of service.

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Generally, patients who have overseas insurance coverage should expect to pay the bill at the time services are rendered and then seek reimbursement from their insurance company. Contact your health insurance company directly to find out if your policy includes overseas coverage. Many care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Czech Ministry of Health](https://www.mzcr.cz/) to ensure the medication is legal in the Czech Republic.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to the Czech Republic.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in the Czech Republic.
* Although the Czech Republic has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in the Czech Republic, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.

* The Czech Republic neither legalizes, regulates, nor prohibits couples to apply and perform surrogacy treatments. According to current legislation, assisted reproduction therapy permits heterosexual couples to apply but at present restricts single women or homosexual couples to [apply for assisted reproduction.](https://pronatal.cz/en/legislation)
