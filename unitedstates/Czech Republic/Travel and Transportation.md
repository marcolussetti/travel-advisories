**Road Conditions and Safety:**

* We strongly recommend that you **familiarize yourself** with the traffic laws of the Czech Republic to avoid fines, detention, or potential imprisonment.
* On two-lane roads and in small towns, drivers will encounter uneven surfaces, roads in poor condition, irregular lane markings, and unclear sign placements.
* Pay special attention when **driving on cobblestones** and among **streetcars** in historic city centers, especially in wet or icy conditions.

**Traffic Laws:**

* To drive in the Czech Republic, visitors must have an **International Driving Permit (IDP),** available from AAA in the United States, to accompany a U.S. driver’s license. Failure to have an IDP with a valid license may result in an additional fine if stopped for a traffic offense, or **denial of an insurance** **claim** after an accident.
* All **private cars**, including those of foreign visitors, must carry **additional safety gear,** including reflective jackets, warning triangles, and a first aid kit. These can be purchased at any gas station or large supermarket.
* In the case of a traffic accident or breakdown on the highway, make sure that you use the warning triangle, placing it at least 100 meters before the car on a highway and 50 meters on other roads. For all accidents, call the Police at 158, or Emergency Services at 112. For general roadside assistance call Road Traffic Assistance (UAMK) at **phone number 1240**. UAMK **operates 24 hours a day**and can be called from highway telephones, located every two kilometers alongside the road.
* Czech law requires all passengers and occupants of private vehicles to use seatbelts.
* There is a **zero-tolerance** policy for **driving under the influence of alcohol**. Police can use breathalyzers on drivers stopped for any reason. Driving with any detected alcohol in the body, however slight, is **illegal** and usually leads to immediate fines and possible criminal proceedings.
* Czech law requires the use of **headlights** at all times.
* A **toll sticker** is required for all cars to drive legally on major **highways**. For more information, visit [the official Czech highway toll website.](http://www.motorway.cz/stickers)
* In the **Czech Republic**, **winter tires** are obligatory from November 1st to March 31st, if there are wintery weather conditions, or if such conditions are to be expected during your drive.
* Using hand-held **cell phones** while driving is **prohibited**.
* Streetcars always have the right of way over other vehicles and pedestrians, including at crosswalks.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation in the Czech Republic is generally very good. There are extensive intercity train and bus networks, and larger cities have high-quality urban mass transit systems. Information on tickets and pricing within Prague can be found[**here**](https://www.dpp.cz/en)**.**

* Passengers on public transportation must **buy a ticket prior to boarding and validate it upon boarding** to avoid being fined. Tickets must be **validated** by inserting it into a validator found inside trams and buses and in the entry halls of Metro stations.
* In Prague, tickets can be purchased at newspaper stands, post offices, and from vending machines at all metro stations and at major tram stops. Tickets can also be purchased by text message on a mobile phone on a Czech network, but the traveler must have received the reply message with the ticket before entering a tram, bus, or metro station. Most newer trams also allow passengers to purchase tickets onboard.
* Travelers may encounter **plain-clothes ticket inspectors** wearing small metal badges with “Přepravní Kontrola” on them at any time. **Fines** for failure to have a validated ticket range from 50 to 1500 CZK. In Prague, the usual fine is 800 CZK if paid on the spot or within 15 days. Inspectors should provide a receipt for on-the-spot payments.
* Trams always have the right of way over pedestrians, including at crosswalks.
* **Legitimate taxis** are clearly marked, and the Embassy strongly recommends calling for a taxi rather than hailing one on the street. If calling is not possible, visitors should get taxis at clearly marked **“Fair Place” stands**. The potential for **substantial overcharging** in taxis exists, particularly in tourist areas. Agree on a **price** in advance or ensure the driver is using the **meter**. Ridesharing and mobile taxi apps, such as Uber and Liftago, are prevalent in Prague and in most major cities.
