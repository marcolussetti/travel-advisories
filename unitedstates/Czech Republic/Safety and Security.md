# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:** The Czech Republic generally has little crime. However, you should still take precautions against becoming a victim of crime.

**Emergencies:** dial 112

**Police:** dial 158

**Firefighters and Rescue:** dial 150

**Emergency Medical Service:** dial 155

* **Pickpocketing** is problematic, especially in major **tourist** **areas** in Prague. Criminals operate in professional, highly organized groups and may be armed with simple **weapons**, so avoid direct confrontation. Do not leave your belongings unattended. High-risk areas include:
  + public transportation,
  + the city center,
  + crowded areas and outdoor cafes.
* **Victims of sexual assault**report being drugged with rohypnol and other **“date rape”-type drugs**.
* Use caution when **accepting open drinks at bars or clubs,** and do not leave drinks unattended.
* **Pedestrian** traffic violations, such as jaywalking, may be enforced in Prague’s city center. Discretionary **fines** up to 2000 Czech crowns (about $100) may be applied. Refusal to pay may lead to a court procedure and an even higher fine. Streetcars have the right of way over pedestrians at crosswalks.
* Casinos and gaming establishments are government-regulated, but some have been affiliated with, or attracted the interest of, organized crime.
* Conduct **currency exchanges** at reputable banks or legitimate money kiosks. Pay close attention to the exact rate offered for the amount you wish to exchange, as rates may vary widely for smaller versus larger amounts and between different exchange offices. An offer to exchange currency by an unknown person on the street is most likely a **scam**.
* **ATMs** are widely available throughout major cities. Criminal organizations have used electronic “skimming” to steal card information and PIN numbers at some ATMs. Use ATMs at secure, monitored locations (commercial banks, large hotels, and the airport).
* **Auto thefts** and **break-ins** are common in the Czech Republic, especially in major cities. Use parking garages and anti-theft devices. Don’t leave valuables in plain sight inside vehicles, as this significantly increases the possibility of theft.
* **Overcharging scams:** Verify charges paid with credit card are correct before signing for purchases, keep all receipts, and check your credit card accounts online to ensure correct billing.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules regarding best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas and activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.

Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
