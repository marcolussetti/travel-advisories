# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** Travelers are subject to local laws. The Egyptian legal system is different from the legal system in the United States, with significantly different standards of evidence, due process, and rule of law. Travelers should be conscious of their behavior and how it may be interpreted by Egyptian authorities. If one violates local laws, even unknowingly, one may be denied entry, expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits, or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Egyptian police and security forces do not require probable cause in order to stop, question, and detain individuals. Failure to carry proper identification, such as a passport, may result in detention and questioning.
* Suspects may be detained without charges or access to immediate legal counsel for months during the investigative stage of a criminal case.
* U.S. citizens have been detained for several days or more in non-criminal cases, including immigration violations.
* Local laws prohibit protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Even being in the vicinity of anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police or security forces, including demands to search personal electronic devices. U.S. citizens have been detained for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.
* Punishments often can be harsher in Egypt for comparable crimes than they are in the United States. Penalties for drug offenses can be particularly severe, including life in prison or the death penalty.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Dual U.S.-Egyptian Citizens*:*** Egyptian law considers dual nationals to be Egyptian citizens and thus the Egyptian authorities do not automatically notify the U.S. Embassy when a dual national is detained, or provide information about their alleged crime. Family members, friends, and/or traveling companions may notify the ACS Unit at U.S. Embassy Cairo if the arrested U.S. citizen is unable to do so. U.S. citizenship does not provide protection from detention or arrest by Egyptian authorities and individuals detained may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention.  U.S. citizens arrested for any reason in Egypt may be deported, even if they are not convicted of a crime.  Detained U.S.-Egyptian citizens have been asked by the Government of Egypt to renounce their Egyptian citizenship as a condition of their deportation to the United States.

Consular officers must obtain authorization from Egyptian authorities to visit American detainees.

**Currency:**

* Entering or exiting Egypt with more than $10,000 is prohibited. Attempting to enter or depart Egypt with any instruments of currency in the sum of more than $10,000 could result in the confiscation of the money over $10,000 and other penalties.

**Drones:**

Importation of all types of drones, including small civilian drones used for personal or touristic purposes is strictly prohibited. Potential penalties for violating are harsh, and a recently passed law authorizes the death penalty for using a drone in support of terrorist activity.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Cultural Property:**Travelers should note that Egyptian law prohibits the unauthorized removal of antiquities (including historic coins, ceramics, and architectural elements) both from archaeological sites and other sources in Egypt. Egyptian law also forbids the intentional damaging of antiquities, such as inscribing or painting on them or attaching advertisements. The trade, sale, or export in antiquities is also heavily restricted and regulated. Travelers may be prosecuted if found to be looting or damaging archaeological sites, buying antiquities, or smuggling antiquities out of Egypt. Penalties include fines and/or imprisonment.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** LGB individuals face significant social stigma and discrimination in Egypt. Egyptian law does not criminalize same-sex sexual activity, but LGB persons and advocacy groups have reported harassment, intimidation, arrests, and other forms of abuse, including by police. There are also reports that authorities have used social media, dating websites, and cell phone apps to entrap persons suspected of being LGB in an act of “debauchery,” which is a criminal offense that carries sentences of up to 10 years. Police have confiscated rainbow flags and sometimes detained their owners. See our LGB Travel Information page and sections 1c and 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for details.

**ACCESSIBILITY:** While in Egypt, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. Businesses and institutions in Egypt generally do not make special accommodations for persons with disabilities, and Egyptian authorities do not enforce laws mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings by persons with disabilities. Pedestrian sidewalks and walkways are limited, uneven, high, and sometimes used by cars and motorcycles.

Accommodations on public transportation are not offered for elderly individuals or persons with disabilities. Crosswalks are not in widespread use and motorists have the right of way. Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution.

**Students:** See the [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:** Many women travel safely each year without incident. However, when it comes to health and security, women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit. The truth is that women face greater obstacles, especially when travelling alone.

Women, especially those traveling alone, should exercise particular care in crowds, on public transportation, in rural areas, and in isolated sections of temple and pyramid complexes. Women have been groped in taxis and while in public places.  
  
Women travelling alone or with children, including Westerners and U.S. citizens, may be stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male companion. Women and men of Egyptian heritage requesting overnight stay in hotel room may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship.

The Embassy continues to receive reports of U.S. citizen women subject to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and rape in Egypt.

Some Egyptian NGOs provide assistance to victimized women within the Egyptian community. Women victimized overseas may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocating back to the United States.
