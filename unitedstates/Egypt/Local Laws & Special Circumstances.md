# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal penalties**

U.S. citizens must follow local laws. If you break a law, even by mistake, you can be expelled, arrested, or jailed.

* If you’re starting a business or a licensed profession, you must seek information from local authorities before operating.
* Egyptian police can stop, question, and detain people without cause. Not carrying proper ID, like a passport, may result in detention and questioning.
* Suspects can be held for months without charges. You may not have access to immediate legal counsel during criminal investigations.
* U.S. citizens have been detained for several days in non-criminal cases, including immigration issues.
* Local laws require permits for protests. Being near anti-government demonstrations can attract police attention, including searches of personal devices. U.S. citizens have been detained for posting content on social media seen as critical of Egypt or its allies.
* Punishments in Egypt often can be harsher than in the United States. For example, drug offenses carry severe penalties, including life in prison or the death penalty.

You may be prosecuted in the U.S. for crimes committed abroad regardless of local laws.

**Arrest notification**

If you are [arrested or detained](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html), ask police or prison officials to inform the U.S. Embassy immediately.  Arrested individuals should avoid signing untranslated documents from the police that they do not understand.

**Dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens**

Egyptian law considers dual U.S.-Egyptian nationals to be Egyptian citizens.

Egyptian authorities will not notify the Embassy if a dual national is detained. They will not provide information to the United States about the alleged crime. Additionally, consular officers must obtain authorization from Egyptian authorities to visit U.S. citizen detainees.

* Family members or friends can notify the ACS Unit at U.S. Embassy Cairo if the arrested U.S. citizen is unable to.
* U.S. citizenship doesn’t protect you against detention or arrest by Egyptian authorities. You could face prolonged interrogations and detention.
* U.S. citizens arrested in Egypt can be deported, even without a conviction.
* The Government of Egypt has asked detained U.S.-Egyptian citizens to give up their Egyptian citizenship to be deported to the U.S.

**Currency**

Bringing more than $10,000 into or out of Egypt is illegal. If you do, the extra money may be taken, and you could face other penalties.

Egypt places limits on the quantity of gold that individuals may import into Egypt.

**Drones**

Bringing any type of drone to Egypt, including small personal ones, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule can lead to severe penalties. This includes the death penalty for using a drone to support terrorists.  Drones may be confiscated and not returned.

**Counterfeit and pirated goods**

Counterfeit and pirated goods are common but may be illegal according to local laws.

* They may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.
* You could get fined or forced to give your goods to the authorities if you try to bring them back into the U.S.

* Intentional damage to antiquities, such as inscribing, painting, or attaching ads, is illegal.
* The trade, sale, or export of antiquities is heavily regulated.

**LGB travelers**

LGB individuals face significant discrimination in Egypt.

* Same-sex relationships are not illegal. But many report harassment and arrests, often by the police.
* Authorities have been known to use social media and dating apps to trap suspected LGB people for “debauchery,” a crime that can lead up to 10 years in prison. Police have also confiscated rainbow flags and detained their owners.

**Travelers with disabilities**

Travelers with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation difficult.

* Most businesses and public places lack access for people with disabilities. Laws requiring access to transportation and communication aren't enforced.
* Sidewalks can be limited, uneven, and sometimes used by cars and motorcycles.
* Public transportation doesn’t have accommodations for the elderly or those with disabilities. Crosswalks are rare, and drivers have the right of way, so pedestrians should be very cautious.

**Women travelers**

Women traveling in Egypt may face unique health and security challenges:

* Avoid traveling alone.
* Exercise caution in crowds, on public transportation, in rural areas, and in isolated sections of temples and pyramids.  The Cairo metro has separate cars for women which may reduce the possibility of harassment.
* Groping has been reported in taxis and public places.
* Women traveling alone or with children may be stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for not traveling with a male companion.
* Egyptian men and women may need to show a marriage certificate to prove their relationship when checking into hotels.
* The Embassy receives reports of U.S. citizen women experiencing domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and rape in Egypt.

Some Egyptian NGOs support affected women. Victims may qualify for compensation, counseling, or relocation to the United States.
