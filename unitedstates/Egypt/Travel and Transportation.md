# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Traffic laws**

Traffic laws in Egypt are not strictly enforced. But foreigners may face extra scrutiny. Driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs could result in arrest or detainment.

**Road conditions and safety**

Driving in Egypt is extremely dangerous:

Egypt has one of the highest rates of road deaths in the world due to:

* Unmarked surfaces
* Pedestrians and animals crossing streets
* Speed bumps along major highways
* Sandstorms and fog
* Vehicles without lights
* Vehicles without reflectors

Driving in Cairo can be very challenging for foreigners used to strict traffic rules. Even locals must stay alert in chaotic streets. Impatient drivers often ignore traffic rules, which police rarely enforce.

Most traffic lights in Cairo don’t work. Instead, police direct traffic using hand signals.

Vehicle accidents are a major safety concern.

Consider using taxis or hired drivers instead of driving yourself.

If you choose to drive:

* Take extreme precautions and drive defensively.
* At night, be ready for unlit vehicles, few road signals, and high-speed traffic. Watch for wrong-way drivers, pedestrians, and animals in the streets.
* Be especially cautious during rare winter rains, which can create slippery roads and flooding.
* Egyptian drivers are not familiar with driving in wet conditions, making this even more dangerous.

Pedestrians should also be careful on busy streets, like Cairo’s Corniche and Alexandria’s Corniche along the Mediterranean.

**Public transportation**

Public buses, Nile taxis, microbuses and trains are not safe. Train travel in Egypt has regular accidents involving mass casualties.  There have been multiple fatal accidents involving tourist boats along the Red Sea coast of Egypt, specifically boats used for scuba-diving trips.

**Embassy employees transport**

Due to security risks, U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from:

* Using buses, microbuses or trains (except the train from Cairo and Alexandria).
* Traveling outside the greater Cairo and Alexandria areas by car. This is except for travel to beach resorts on the western side of the Red Sea and near Alexandria.
* Traveling via privately-owned vehicles to any part of the Sinai Peninsula.
* Traveling to the Western Desert with a privately owned vehicle. Embassy personnel may travel with a professionally licensed tour company.

Embassy personnel may travel to Siwa Oasis by the northern route, in a private vehicle

**Aviation safety oversight**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Egypt’s Civil Aviation Authority as compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Egypt’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).
