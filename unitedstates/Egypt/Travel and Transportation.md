# Travel and Transportation

**Traffic Laws:** Although the enforcement of traffic laws generally is lax, foreigners are subject to extra scrutiny and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in arrest or detainment.

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving in Egypt is extremely hazardous. Egypt has one of the highest occurrences of road fatalities per mile driven in the world. Intercity roads are generally in good condition, but unmarked surfaces, pedestrians, stray animals, sandstorms and fog, vehicles without lights, and disabled vehicles without reflectors are among the many hazards present on highways, especially after dark.

Driving Cairo’s busy maze of streets can be an extreme challenge to foreigners, especially those used to a culture of structured rules and regulations. Even residents of Cairo must use extreme care and situational awareness to navigate the capital’s hectic streets. Impatient drivers typically ignore traffic rules, which police seldom enforce. Most traffic lights in Cairo do not function; instead, police officers, using finger and hand movements to direct traffic, normally staff the main intersections.

Vehicle accidents remain a significant safety concern.

Visitors thinking about driving in Egypt should carefully consider other options, such as a taxi or hired driver. If visitors decide to drive, it is essential that they take the utmost precautions and drive defensively. Drivers should be prepared for unlit vehicles at night, few road markings, vehicles traveling at high rates of speed, vehicles traveling the wrong way on one-way streets, divided highways, and connecting ramps, pedestrians dodging in and out of traffic, and domesticated animals on the roadways. Motorists should be especially cautious during the rare winter rains, which can cause extremely slippery road surfaces and localized flooding; Egyptian drivers are not familiar with driving in wet conditions, making such periods particularly hazardous.

Pedestrians should also exercise extreme caution on high-volume/high-velocity streets, like Cairo’s Corniche, which follows the eastern bank of the Nile River, and Alexandria’s Corniche along the Mediterranean.

**Public Transportation:** Public buses and microbuses are not safe, and Embassy personnel are prohibited from using them. Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling by train, the only exception being the train between Cairo and Alexandria. In general, train travel is a particularly unsafe means of transportation, with regular accidents that sometimes involve mass casualties.

Embassy personnel are generally prohibited from traveling outside the greater Cairo and Alexandria areas by motor vehicle, with the exception of travel to beach resorts on the western side of the Red Sea and near Alexandria. Furthermore, Embassy policy prohibits personal travel via privately-owned vehicle to any part of the Sinai Peninsula. Embassy personnel may travel to the Western Desert with a professionally licensed tour company and not with a privately-owned vehicle. Overland travel to Siwa Oasis is approved for Embassy personnel along the northern route by privately-owned vehicle.

**AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Egypt’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Egypt’s air carrier operations.
