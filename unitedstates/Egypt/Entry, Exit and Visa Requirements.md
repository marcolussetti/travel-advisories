[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passport and Visas:**

* U.S. citizens must have a visa to enter Egypt.
* U.S. citizens can obtain a renewable single-entry 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Egyptian airports for a 25 USD fee. A multiple entry visa is also obtainable for 60 USD. (U.S Citizens holding a diplomatic or official passport require an official visa prior to travel if the purpose is work-related. Official travelers should not attempt to enter on a non-official passport.)
* The Government of Egypt has created a website for the issuance of “[e-visas](https://visa2egypt.gov.eg/eVisa/Home).” There are other websites purporting to offer electronic visas, some of which reportedly charge double the official price, but this is the only official Government of Egypt portal for this service. U.S. citizens and the citizens of 44 other countries are eligible to apply through this means in advance of their travel.
* Egyptian immigration officials occasionally have denied entry to travelers without explanation.
* U.S. citizens who have experienced difficulty with their visa status in Egypt or are concerned about their eligibility for a visa upon arrival should apply for a visa at an Egyptian embassy or consulate prior to travel, but a visa obtained prior to entry does not guarantee admission to Egypt.
* Visas for gainful employment or study in Egypt must be obtained prior to travel.

**Entry from Israel:**

* If travelers attempt to depart Egypt after the expiration of their visa, they may be required to pay a fine at the airport. Travelers should ensure that they arrive to the airport early with sufficient Egyptian currency to pay any fines.
* The U.S. Embassy does not issue travel letters to exit Egypt.

**Dual Nationals:**

* If a dual national has the annotation “Egyptian origin” on their entry visa, they will require proof of Egyptian citizenship in order to exit Egypt.
* This is also true for dual nationals who remain in Egypt for more than six months.
* In some cases, if a dual national loses their U.S. passport, they will be required to present their parents’ Egyptian birth certificates and be documented as Egyptian citizens in order to obtain a temporary/replacement entry stamp to facilitate their travel out of Egypt.
* Male U.S. citizens who also hold Egyptian nationality, between 18-40 years old, who have stayed in Egypt more than 180 days, are required to finalize their Egyptian military status before departure, or risk being refused departure from Egypt by Egyptian Immigration officials. The U.S. Embassy is unable to intervene in these situations. For more information see: <https://tagned.mod.gov.eg/>.
