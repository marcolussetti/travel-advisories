**Passport and visas**

U.S. citizens must have a visa to enter Egypt:

* The Government of Egypt has launched a website for issuing [e-visas](https://visa2egypt.gov.eg/eVisa/Home). Many sites claim to offer e-visas, some at double the price. This is the only official source.  (U.S. citizens and the citizens of 44 other countries can apply for an e-visa before traveling.)
* You can get a renewable single-entry 30-day tourist visa on arrival at Egyptian airports for approximately $25 in cash, in U.S. dollars. A multiple entry visa costs approximately $60.
* U.S. citizens with visa issues, or arrival visa concerns, may apply for a visa at an Egyptian embassy or consulate before traveling. However, having a visa does not guarantee entry into Egypt.
* Egyptian immigration officials occasionally have denied entry to travelers without explanation.
* Work or study visas must be obtained before traveling.

U.S. citizens with a diplomatic or official passport must obtain an official visa in advance for work-related travel.

**Entry from Israel**

U.S. citizens arriving from Israel at the Taba border crossing must obtain a visa ahead of time:

* Travelers without a visa can apply for a free, 14-day visa on arrival in Egypt. It is valid only in the Sinai Peninsula. They can also get a 30-day tourist visa for approximately $25, which allows travel throughout all of Egypt.
* To get the 30-day visa, travelers must submit a support letter from a travel agency. You can get this letter from travel agents at the border, but fees vary.

**Gaza**

Those seeking to leave Gaza should contact the [US Embassy in Jerusalem](mailto:JerusalemACS@state.gov).

* Avoid travel to Gaza. The U.S. Embassy does not issue travel letters or help in crossing into Gaza.
* Travelers to Gaza from Egypt should read the [Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/israel-west-bank-and-gaza-travel-advisory.html). The Sinai Peninsula is very dangerous. The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) often attacks security forces and civilians there.

**Diplomatic and official passports**

Diplomatic and official passport holders must have visas **before** arrival in Egypt for official business:

* If you do not, you may be denied entry. You must stay in the airport transit area at your own expense until you can leave Egypt.  The U.S. Embassy in Cairo cannot intervene in such situations.
* Please contact the [Special Issuance Agency](https://travel.state.gov/content/special-issuance-agency-home/en/spec-issuance-agency/official-diplomatic-visa-information/egypt.html) in Washington, DC for more information related to obtaining visas in your diplomatic or official U.S. passport.
* Military personnel arriving on commercial flights must still meet passport and visa requirements.
* Diplomatic or official passport holders must use their personal passports for unofficial travel to Egypt and follow all regulations.
* The [Egyptian Embassy](https://egyptembassy.net/the-embassy/) in Washington currently requires at least 3 weeks, and sometimes longer, to process official and diplomatic visa requests, even with a Department of State expedite letter.
* All official travelers must submit their visa requests and passports to the Egyptian Embassy well before their trip.

**Work permits**

U.S. citizens who wish to work in Egypt must obtain work permits and business visas before arrival.

* You must get work permits through your employer. These allow you to live in the country.
* U.S. citizens in Egypt on tourist visas are not allowed to work.

For additional information on entering Egypt, please contact the nearest [Egyptian Embassy](https://egyptembassy.net/the-embassy/) or Consulate.

**Medical requirements**

* U.S. citizens arriving from a yellow fever-infected area must show proof of vaccination.
* U.S. citizens have been arrested and convicted when entering Egypt with medical marijuana and CBD products even with a prescription.
* If you plan to bring prescription medication into Egypt, be aware that not all medications that are legal in the U.S. are allowed. Keep your medicine in its original packaging and carry a letter from your doctor that notes:
  + The medication is for personal use.
  + The required dosage.
  + The condition you're being treated for.
  + The amount you're bringing.

The Ministry of Health will check your medication when you arrive.

**Exit requirements**

* Customs officials will review your entry visa stamp upon your departure. If you lose your passport with the entry stamp, you'll need to go to an Egyptian government office to get a stamp after receiving a new passport at the Embassy.
* If travelers try to leave Egypt after their visa expires, they may have to pay a fine at the airport. Arrive early with enough Egyptian currency to cover fines.
* U.S. citizen women married to Egyptians can leave Egypt without their spouse's permission.
* A U.S. citizen leaving Egypt with a dual-national child (U.S.-Egyptian) may need to show proof of consent from the non-traveling Egyptian parent at the airport.
* The U.S. Embassy does not issue travel letters to exit Egypt.

**Dual nationals**

* If your entry visa has the note "Egyptian origin," you must show proof of Egyptian citizenship to leave. This also applies to dual nationals who stay in Egypt for more than 6 months.
* Male U.S. citizens with Egyptian nationality, ages 18-40, who have stayed in Egypt more than 180 days must finalize their military status according to Egyptian law before leaving. If not, they risk that immigration officials deny them departure. The U.S. government cannot help in these cases.
