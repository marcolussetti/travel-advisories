# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The Department of State Travel Advisory warns U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula and parts of the Western Desert due to terrorism. (Tourists regularly travel to tour Southern Sinai destinations along the Red Sea, such as Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab and Taba, as well as St. Catherine’s Monastery/Mt. Sinai. Travelers should review updated news reports for those areas prior to their travel.) Travel to the Libyan and Sudanese borders is also not recommended. Travel to the Black Desert and White Desert should only be done with a professionally licensed tour company and not self-drive. U.S. citizens in Egypt should maintain a high level of vigilance throughout the country due to the threat of terrorism.

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, resorts, and local government facilities. There is a possibility of terrorist attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. The Egyptian government has attempted to address security concerns and has visibly augmented its security presence at tourist locations, but challenges persist, and the threat of terrorism remains. Police and military are also engaged in operations to combat terrorism and disrupt terrorist cells in the Sinai Peninsula and the Nile Valley.

**Do not travel to:**

* **The Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula** due to terrorism.

The Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula as U.S. government employees are not authorized to travel to these areas (with the exception of the beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh; travel to Sharm El-Sheikh and points along the Red Sea coast.)

* **The Western Desert** due to terrorism. (Tourist regularly travel to the Black and White deserts but only with a professionally licensed tour company. They should avoid using their personal vehicle in these areas.)
* **Egyptian border areas** other than official ports of entry.

Egypt’s borders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and vehicles is substantially restricted, and in some cases prohibited, within these areas. U.S. citizens should not travel in these border zones.

It is illegal to photograph police stations, military barracks, and certain other sensitive public buildings.

U.S. citizens are urged to remain alert to local security developments, avoid demonstrations, and be vigilant regarding their personal security at all times throughout the country. U.S. citizens should also carry identification and a cell phone or other means of communication that works in Egypt, and it is advisable to pre-program the U.S. Embassy’s telephone number (+20 2 2797-3300).

Travelers must obtain permission and a travel route from the Egyptian Military Intelligence and the Tourist Police Headquarters via a local or overseas travel agency to access Egypt's frontiers, including the borders with Libya, Sudan, Israel, and parts of the Sinai Peninsula off paved roads.

High concentrations of World War II-era unexploded landmines are located in the World War II battlefields along the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria, the Eastern Desert between Cairo and the Suez Canal, and much of the Sinai Peninsula. Travelers are urged to be especially cautious in these areas.

**Crime**: Crime levels in Cairo and Alexandria are moderate.

The vast majority of criminal acts against foreigners are crimes of opportunity, such as purse snatching and pickpocketing.

Harassment of women, including foreigners, remains a serious problem. Incidents of harassment range from lewd comments and gestures to indecent exposure and inappropriate physical contact.

Tourists should be alert to being overcharged for various services and for being victimized in scams common to tourist destinations worldwide. Tourists should expect to encounter aggressive vendors at Egypt’s shops in urban areas, as well as at the many temples and archaeological sites. Some will offer “free” gifts to tourists which, once accepted, lead to demands for money. Most sites have specially designated tourist police who can assist in uncomfortable situations.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent. (If applicable)
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams**: See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Egypt.html%22%20/l%20%22ExternalPopup) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Egypt. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers

The U.S. Embassy receives frequent reports of online financial scams, often involving a fraudulent romantic partner requesting money for hospital bills or legal expenses to depart Egypt. Be skeptical about sending money to anyone known only through online contact.

**Technology Usage Abroad**: Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**

U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault and domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Women who report sexual assault and domestic violence to local authorities have little recourse in Egypt, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of evidence in the Egyptian judicial system.

Report crimes to the local police at 122 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(20) 2-2797-3300. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. The Embassy cannot intervene in legal disputes.

U.S. citizen tourists can forward their complaints for investigation to the Tourist Police Headquarters. For crimes involving children, you may call Egypt’s Child Emergency Help line by dialing 16000. Egypt’s National Council for Women provides some assistance to women who are victims of domestic violence, or other complaints, at phone number 15115 or website: [http://www.oo-ncw.org](http://www.oo-ncw.org/). Failure to report crimes before leaving Egypt will make it impossible to seek prosecution at a later date.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and adventure facilities may not frequently occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are not always able to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
