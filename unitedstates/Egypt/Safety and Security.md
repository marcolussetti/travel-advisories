# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Emergency phone numbers**

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

* For all emergencies in Egypt **dial 123**.
* For the U.S. Embassy in Egypt **dial +20-2-2797-3300** to report crimes or emergencies (after calling local authorities). You may also report crimes to the U.S. Embassy in Egypt [here](https://bit.ly/CairoACS).

**Areas to avoid**

U.S. citizens should avoid traveling to these areas:

* **Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula:** Terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians still occur but are becoming increasingly rare. The U.S. government can only provide limited emergency services. U.S. Government employees may only travel to Sharm-El-Sheikh and nearby areas along the Red Sea coast due to limited emergency infrastructure in Middle Sinai Peninsula.
* **All Egyptian border areas:** Under military control. Movement of non-military people and vehicles is restricted, and in some cases, prohibited.
* **Parts of the Western Desert**
* **Libyan and Sudanese borders**

Be cautious and check the news if traveling to Southern Sinai, along the Red Sea.

* Sharm-El-Sheikh
* Dahab and Taba
* St. Catherine’s Monastery/Mt. Sinai

You should only travel to the Black Desert and White Desert with a licensed tour company.  Stay alert throughout the country due to the threat of terrorism.

**Terrorism**

Globally, [terrorist groups](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) and their supporters aim to attack U.S. citizens abroad with methods such as knives, firearms, and vehicles.

Terrorists target crowds with little or no warning at:

* Religious sites (mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling there)
* Local government buildings, and diplomatic facilities (embassies)
* Tourist spots
* Transportation centers
* Shopping malls
* Restaurants and Western businesses
* Resorts
* Urban areas

The Egyptian government has boosted security at tourist sites to address safety concerns. But challenges remain, and the threat of terrorism exists.

**How to stay safe**

U.S. citizens must always be aware of their surroundings:

* Check local news and reports.
* Avoid demonstrations.
* Keep a low profile.
* Carry copies of your passport and visa and a cellphone with service in Egypt.
* Save the U.S. Embassy’s phone number **+20 2 2797-3300**.
* It is illegal to photograph police stations, military barracks, and certain other sensitive public buildings.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step)

**Egyptian borders**

Travelers must get permission and a travel route from the Egyptian Military Intelligence and the Tourist Police to access:

* Borders with Libya
* Borders with Sudan
* Borders with Israel
* Parts of the Sinai Peninsula off paved roads

Arrangements must be made through a local or overseas travel agency.

**Landmines**

There are World War II-era unexploded landmines in these areas:

* The Sinai Peninsula
* Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria
* Eastern Desert between Cairo and the Suez Canal

Pay attention to warning signs in these areas.

**Crime**

Crime levels in Cairo and Alexandria are moderate.

* Most crimes against foreigners are crimes of opportunity, like purse snatching and pickpocketing.
* Harassment of women, including foreigners, is a problem in Egypt. It can include vulgar comments, gestures, indecent exposure, and unwanted physical contact.
* Tourists should beware of overcharging and scams in tourist areas. You may encounter aggressive vendors in shops, at temples, and archaeological sites. Some will offer “free” gifts that lead to money demands. Most sites have tourist police available to help in uncomfortable situations.

**Demonstrations**

Demonstrations happen occasionally and are unpredictable.  They occur as a result of political or economic issues, on holidays, and during international events.

* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International scams**

Internet romance and financial scams are common in Egypt. Follow the Department of State [guidelines to protect yourself from scams](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and learn how the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) can help.

How to avoid scammers:

Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to. Instead of helping, refer them to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We will work with local authorities to assist them.

Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers

If using dating apps or websites:

* Inform friends and family of your location. Meet in a busy public place. Avoid eating or drinking anything suspicious.
* Set up a video call in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* Don't go to bars or nightclubs alone.

Look for red flags such as:

* People who say they live in a remote location.
* Profiles that were recently created or seem too good to be true.
* Receiving unwanted emails or letters.
* The pace of the relationship is moving too quickly.
* Requests for money.

**Technology use abroad**

Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and damage anywhere in the world. Follow these safety practices:

* Update all software (operating system and apps) before leaving.
* Use reputable, U.S. based VPN/VoIP applications.
* Don’t connect to unknown public Wi-Fi networks.
* The Egyptian government does not allow visitors to enter with drones or satellite phones.  Any drone or satellite phones brought into Egypt will be taken by the Egyptian government and not returned.
* Be cautious using dating apps abroad, as scammers often target U.S. citizens.

**GPS apps**

Prior to using any GPS apps, research the route to make sure it’s safe. The shortest path may not be the safest.

Online maps and navigation apps may not be up to date with ongoing construction of highways and bridges, especially in major cities like Cairo.

**Victims of crime**

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. If you don’t report a crime before leaving Egypt, you won’t be able to seek prosecution later:

* For the U.S. Embassy **dial +(20) 2-2797-3300**.
* To report crimes to the local police **dial 122**
* For Egypt’s Child Emergency Help line **dial 16000**.
* For Egypt’s National Council for Women **dial 15115**.
* For the Tourist Police to send complaints for investigation dial 126

The Embassy cannot intervene in legal disputes.  The U.S. Department of State provides information. We can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Help you report a crime to the police.
* Contact family or friends with your written consent.
* Provide general information about the victim’s role during the local investigation.
* Provide a list of local attorneys (does not imply support).
* Inform you of [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/victims.html)
* Issue an emergency loan for repatriation to the U.S. or limited financial support in cases of poverty.
* Help you find accommodation and arrange flights home.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Sexual assault**

Victims of sexual assault may wish to contact the U.S. Embassy.  However, local assistance and support are limited. Women who have been sexually assaulted may contact Egypt’s National Council for Women (NCW) [here](https://ncw.gov.eg/Page/385/%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A3%D8%A9) or:

* **Dial 15115** or via WhatsApp: **01007525600**.

Victims will be referred to health, legal, psychosocial or shelter services.

The NCW and the Ministry of Health and Population have established Safe Women Clinics across Egypt. These clinics offer medical assessments, referrals to specialized departments, and post-rape kits. The Embassy can help connect you with these resources.

Women who report sexual assault and domestic violence to local police in Egypt often have few options for help. In some cases, victims have even been accused of adultery or other crimes.

**Tourism**

Tourism activities are widespread in Egypt.

* There are safety and accessibility limitations at many tourism sites.
* Private vendors may offer services that are not regulated.
* Appropriate medical care is available only in or near major cities or tourist areas.
* Urgent medical treatment options are limited.
* There have been multiple fatal accidents involving tourist boats along the Red Sea coast of Egypt, specifically boats used for overnight scuba-diving trips.

U.S. citizens should check overseas insurers. They should consider buying medical evacuation insurance for care and transport.

**Weather and Natural Disasters**

Egypt experiences several weather events, including:

* **Sandstorms:** Common in spring. They reduce visibility and air quality, affecting daily life.
* **Heatwaves:** High temperatures, especially in the summer. They can reach extreme levels, sometimes exceeding 104 F.
* **Flooding:** Heavy rains, while rare, can lead to flash flooding in urban areas and near the Nile.
* **Cold waves:** In winter, the north may see unexpected cold spells. They can bring rain and low temperatures.
* **Fog:** Coastal areas may have dense winter fog, reducing visibility for travel.
* **Drought:** Low rainfall can cause drought, harming crops and water supply.
