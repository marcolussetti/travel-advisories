For emergency services in Egypt, dial **123**.

Ambulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general Traveler Advice for Egypt.

• Select your destination in the Travelers’ Health webpage.

* Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.

• Review the [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including:

* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
* Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
* and General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Medical Care:**

The Egyptian ambulance service hotline is 123. Emergency and intensive care facilities are limited. Most Nile cruise boats do not have a ship's doctor, but some employ a medical practitioner. Hospital facilities in Luxor, Aswan, and Sharm el Sheikh are adequate, but they are inadequate at most other ports-of-call. Although availability of ambulances is improving, getting them through Cairo traffic can be very challenging.

Beaches on the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts are generally unpolluted. However, persons who swim in the Nile or its canals, walk barefoot in stagnant water, or drink untreated water are at risk of exposure to bacterial and other infections and the parasitic disease schistosomiasis (bilharzia).

It is generally safe to eat freshly prepared cooked food in hotels, on Nile cruise boats, and in mainstream restaurants. When selecting a restaurant, travelers should select a clean and reputable place, eat only freshly prepared, cooked foods, avoid all uncooked food including raw fruits and vegetables. Tap water in some locations is not potable. It is best to drink bottled water or water that has been boiled and filtered. Well-known brands of bottled beverages are generally considered to be safe if the seal is intact.

Although the Embassy cannot provide medical advice or provide medical services to the public, [a list of hospitals and doctors in Egypt](https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/)can be found on the Embassy website.

**Prescriptions:** Travelers should carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Egypt’s Ministry of Health](https://www.visitegypt.gov.eg/) to ensure the medication is legal in Egypt.

**Vaccinations:** Travelers should be up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations, per CDC’s information.
