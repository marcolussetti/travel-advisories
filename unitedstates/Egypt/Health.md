**Emergency numbers**

For medical emergencies **dial 123**.

**Ambulance services**

Ambulances are rare, unreliable in most areas, and don’t have advanced medical equipment.

* Ambulances and emergency crews often lack training.
* Ambulance availability is improving. But Cairo traffic makes it hard to get them through.
* In an emergency, travelers may prefer to take a taxi or car to the hospital rather than an ambulance.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the [CDC’s Health Advice for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) to Egypt.

**Medical insurance**

* The U.S. government including Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates **do not** pay medical bills.
* U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not work abroad.
* Make sure your insurance plan works abroad. The [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Egypt.html#ExternalPopup) provides more information on types of insurance available.
* Most hospitals and doctors abroad don’t accept U.S. health insurance.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission.
* Credit card payment is not always available. Most care providers abroad only accept cash.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html)  to cover medical evacuation.

**Healthcare**

Emergency and intensive care facilities are limited.

* Most Nile cruise boats don’t have a doctor, but some have a medical practitioner.
* Hospitals in Luxor, Aswan, and Sharm-El-Sheikh are good, but they are inadequate at most other ports-of-call.
* Beaches on the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts are generally unpolluted. However, swimming in the Nile or its canals, walking barefoot in stagnant water, or drinking untreated water can expose people to bacteria and infections. They are also at risk of schistosomiasis (bilharzia).
* The Embassy cannot give medical advice or services. [A list of hospitals and doctors in Egypt](https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/doctors/)can be found on the Embassy website.

**Prescriptions**

You must carry prescription medications in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Egypt’s Ministry of Health](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Egypt.html#ExternalPopup) to ensure the medication is legal in Egypt.

**Vaccinations**

Travelers must be up to date on all recommended vaccinations, per CDC’s information.

**Water quality and food safety**

* In many areas, tap water is not safe to drink.
* Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.
* Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled water.
* Ice for drinks may be made from tap water.
* It is generally safe to eat freshly cooked food in hotels, on Nile cruise boats, and in popular restaurants.
* When selecting a restaurant, choose a clean and well-known place.
* Avoid all uncooked food including raw fruits and vegetables to avoid sickness.
