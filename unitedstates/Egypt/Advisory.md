**Updated information related to the Sinai Peninsula and country summary.**

Reconsider travel to Egypt due to **terrorism**. Exercise increased caution in Egypt due to **the Embassy’s limited ability to assist dual national U.S.-Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained.**  Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do not travel to:**

* The Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula due to **terrorism**.
* The Western Desert due to**terrorism**.
* Egyptian border areas due to **military zones**.

**Country Summary:**Extremists continue to express interest in plotting attacks in Egypt against religious sites, government entities, and diplomatic facilities. While Egyptian authorities largely conduct effective security oversight, terrorists may attack with little or no warning and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.

Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.

The U.S. Embassy may have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens, especially in the case of arrest or detention. Egyptian law considers dual citizens to be Egyptian citizens.

**Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula – Level 4: Do Not Travel**  
The Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with occasional attacks on security forces and civilians.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula, as U.S. government employees are not authorized to freely travel into northern and middle Sinai Peninsula. Because access to the entire Sinai Peninsula is highly regulated by the Government of Egypt, emergency services to U.S. citizens in these areas may be delayed.
