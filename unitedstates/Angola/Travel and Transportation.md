# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Major roads between Luanda and the provincial capitals are improving, but some road conditions remain poor while the infrastructure for pedestrians is lacking: Large potholes require reduced speed and can limit main roads to single-lanes, and it is common for people and animals to walk along the road. Drunk driving is also a problem. Other hazards include potholes, lack of or attention to traffic signals, erratic driving habits, poorly maintained vehicles without headlights/taillights/brake lights, excessive speed, pedestrians, and roaming animals. During the rainy season, November-April, roads and bridges that are already in poor condition can become impassable and landmines may become displaced and surface outside known mine fields.

When driving outside of Luanda on other than primary roads between major cities, a four-wheel-drive vehicle is useful. Secondary roads are often unpaved and nearly impassable. Major routes are paved in most areas and feature gas stations and other roadside services. Driving during daylight hours is recommended outside Luanda.

**Traffic Laws:** You will need an international driving permit or Angolan drivers license to drive. You may use a U.S. license for up to one month.

**Checkpoints**: Both inside and around Luanda, police set up spontaneous roadblocks to check for vehicle documentation. They may also solicit bribes or request immediate payment of "fines" for alleged minor infractions. Police and military officials are sometimes undisciplined, and their authority should not be challenged.

* Make sure all vehicle documentation is available for inspection.
* Resist paying bribes. Politely ask for a ticket or for the officer’s name and badge number if no violation is alleged. Ask to contact the U.S. Embassy if you are not let go.
* Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate.
* Carry color photocopies of your passport and other identity documents to give to security or police officials.
* Report any incident to the U.S. Embassy in Luanda.

**Accidents:**In the event of an automobile accident, remain at the scene until the police arrive.

If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.  Do not stop at the scene of an accident where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.

**Landmines:** Use caution in remote areas or off main roads outside of Luanda. Landmines are most common in the southern provinces. The provinces of Bie, Cuando Cubango Cuanza Sul, Moxico, and Huila have a higher prevalence of landmines than other areas of the country.

**Public Transportation:**Avoid all use of public transportation in multi-passenger vans known as *candongueiros* or motorcycles, *taxistas*, and hire private transport from a reliable source. All public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. The U.S. Embassy has determined Allo Taxi is an acceptable rideshare service.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Angola, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Angola’s civil aviation authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Angola should also check for U.S. [maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website (https:homeport.uscg.mil), and the [NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal) select “broadcast warnings.”
