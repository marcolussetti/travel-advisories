# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Major roads between Luanda and the provincial capitals are improving, but road conditions remain poor.

* There are no or only limited sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure.
* People and animals often walk on roadsides or interfere with traffic.
* Large potholes reduce driving speeds and may limit main roads to single lanes.
* Drunk driving is a problem.
* Other hazards include:
  + Potholes
  + Ignored or non-working traffic signals
  + Speeding and erratic driving habits
  + Poorly maintained vehicles with no headlights, taillights, or brake lights
* During the rainy season, November-April, roads and bridges become impassable and landmines may be displaced to roadways from known minefields.

When driving outside of Luanda major routes are paved in most areas and have gas stations and other roadside services. Driving during daylight hours is recommended.

* A four-wheel-drive vehicle may be necessary on secondary roads outside of Luanda.
* Some roads are often unpaved and are impassable with a low-clearance vehicle.

**Traffic Laws:** You will need an international driving permit or Angolan driver’s license to drive. You may use a U.S. license for up to one month.

**Checkpoints**: Both inside and around Luanda, police set up spontaneous roadblocks to check vehicle documentation. They may also solicit bribes or request immediate payment for alleged minor infractions. Police and military officials are sometimes undisciplined, but avoid challenging their authority:

* Make sure all vehicle documentation is available for inspection.
* Resist paying bribes. Politely ask for a ticket or for the officer’s name and badge number if no violation is alleged. Ask to contact the U.S. Embassy if you are not let go.
* Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked. Open your window slightly to communicate.
* Carry color photocopies of your passport and other identity documents to present to security or police officials.
* Report any incident to the U.S. Embassy.

**Accidents:** In the event of an automobile accident, remain at the scene until police arrive.

If a crowd gathers or you feel in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.

* Do not stop at the scene of an accident where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.

**Landmines:** Use caution in remote areas or off main roads outside Luanda. Landmines are most common in the southern provinces, including:

* Bie
* Cuando
* Cubango
* Cuanza Sul
* Moxico
* Huila

**Public Transportation:** Most public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe:

* Avoid public transportation in multi-passenger vans (known as *candongueiros*) or on motorcycles (known as *taxistas*).
* Only hire private transport from reliable sources.
* U.S. Embassy personnel are only authorized to use UGO ride service.

**Aviation Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Angola’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. [FAA's website](https://website/) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Angola should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warning website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
