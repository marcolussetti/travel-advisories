# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times.

Landmines are a risk throughout the country outside major cities.

**Crime:** Armed assailants have killed some victims of muggings, robberies, and car-jackings, which occur frequently in all areas of the country. In fall 2019, a rash of violent robberies ended in homicides in Luanda.  The most commonly used tactic involves two individuals on a motorcycle who follow their victim to rob, usually at gunpoint. Criminals also target women by themselves, driving or walking. Lastly, motorcycles staging an accident is a tactic used to get you to stop and to lure you out of your vehicle or allow the criminals to enter your vehicle allegedly to take them to the hospital. Vehicle thefts, purse snatching, and theft from vehicles occur in areas frequented by foreigners.

* Avoid walking alone, especially after dark, and displaying cash and valuable personal property like watches, jewelry, or smart phones.
* Vary your routes and travel times and let someone know your daily routine.
* Dress conservatively.
* Drive with doors and windows locked and windows rolled up.
* Keep valuables out of sight and do not use cell phones or laptops while stopped in traffic; criminals often brandishing guns use smash and grab tactics to steal valuables.
* Travel with a certified copy of your U.S. passport and Angolan visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location.

**Victims of Crime:**The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Angola is 111: for police it’s 113; for firefighters, 115; and for ambulance services, 112. Emergency numbers listed may not have an English-speaking operator available. Responses from emergency services are frequently severely delayed and may not be available outside Luanda.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

Due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, victims of violent crime, especially rape, are strongly encouraged to seek immediate medical assistance.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/victims.html). The U.S. Embassy can:

* Help you find appropriate medical care,
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police,
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent,
* Explain the local criminal justice process in general terms,
* Provide a list of local attorneys,
* Provide information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States,
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution,
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not widely available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
