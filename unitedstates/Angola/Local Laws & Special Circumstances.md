# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

You may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification or passport. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, review our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Photography:** It is illegal to take pictures or use binoculars, maps, or GPS near government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure. Angolan law defines key infrastructure broadly, to include historic or abandoned train stations or airfields, and bridges of any dimension. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of people without their permission.

**Libel Laws/Slander:** Disrespecting government officials is illegal and can lead to detention and/or expulsion from the country.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Review our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Employment:** Angolan companies often have trouble transferring funds to foreign bank accounts, which can delay payments to foreign employees.

**Phone Service:** Cell phones are the norm and landlines are rare. It is possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. The major cellular providers are Africell and Unitel.

**Currency:** The kwanza (AOA) is the official currency, and most services, including hospitals, must be prepaid in cash.

* Bills should be new and unblemished.
* Local ATMs (*multicaixas*) only dispense kwanzas and frequently malfunction or run out of cash.
* While U.S. debit cards can sometimes be used to withdraw local currency at ATMs, there is a low daily limit of about 100,000 kwanzas, with a per-transaction limit of around 40,000.
* American or international credit cards are rarely accepted, except by a few major international hotels in Luanda.
* Carry enough cash to cover your trip and any emergency services (medical, roadside, etc.) that could occur.

**Currency Regulations:**

* Currency over $10,000 must be declared when entering Angola and when leaving. Amounts over this limit may be seized.
* Limits may change. Verify with the Angolan Embassy or the National Bank.
* Show your original declaration form to the airport customs officials to export currency over the authorized limit. You may not export more money than you entered with.
* Destruction of kwanza notes is illegal.

**Gay and Lesbian Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex sexual relations or the organization of events in Angola. However, societal biases against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation do sometimes result in discrimination, violence, and/or abuse. Same-sex couples have been harassed. Travelers should be cautious prior to meeting someone from an online dating application due to the possibility of harassment and violence.

Review our [Gay and Lesbian Traveler Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) and [section 6 of our Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Persons with disabilities in Angola face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations, particularly outside the capital. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and many buildings lack elevators. Major hotels in Luanda have ramps.
