# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification or passport. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Photography:** It is illegal to take pictures or use binoculars, maps, or GPS near government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure.  Angolan law defines key infrastructure broadly, to include historic or abandoned train stations or airfields, and bridges of any dimension. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of people without their permission.

**Libel Laws/Slander:** Disrespecting government officials is illegal and can lead to expulsion from the country. Angolan authorities confiscated the U.S. passports of a family for several weeks after they complained to immigration officials about the time it took to process their visas and passports at the airport.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Employment:**Angolan companies often have trouble transferring funds to foreign bank accounts, which can delay payments to foreign employees.

**Phone Service:** Cell phones are the norm, as landlines are non-existent. It is possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. The major cellular providers are Angola Movicel, Africell, and Unitel.

**Currency:**The kwanza (AOA) is the official currency, athough U.S. dollars are accepted in some situations. Bills should be new and unblemished. Local ATMs (*multicaixas*) only dispense kwanzas and frequently malfunction or run out of cash. While U.S. debit cards can sometimes be used to withdraw local currency at ATMs, there is a low daily limit of around 100,000 kwanzas (with a per-transaction limit of around 40,000). Aside from a handful of major, international hotels in Luanda, American or international credit cards are rarely accepted. It is recommended to bring a sufficient amount of cash to cover your trip and any emergency services (medical, roadside, etc.) that could occur.

**Currency Regulations:**

* Residents and non-residents must declare combined currency amounts over the equivalent of $10,000 upon arrival. Amounts over this limit may be seized.
* Limits may change—verify with the Angolan Embassy or the National Bank.
* Show your original declaration form to the airport customs officials to export currency over the authorized limit. You are not permitted to export more money than you entered with.
* Destruction of Kwanza notes is illegal.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on LGB conduct or identity, nor on the organization of LGB events in Angola, but, societal biases against LGB persons does sometimes result in discrimination, violence and/or abuse. Same-sex couples have been harassed and, in recent years, LGB foreigners have been the victims of harassment, assault, and homicide. Foreigners should be cautious prior to meeting someone from an online dating application. See our [LGB](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) Travel Information page and Section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/angola/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** Major hotels in Luanda have ramps.  Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations, particularly outside the capital. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:**Statistics on prosecutions for violence against women are not available. Most rape cases are not prosecuted. Domestic violence counseling centers, shelters, and various treatment centers and free legal assistance are available to abused women.
