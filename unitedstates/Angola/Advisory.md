***Updated information on health-related issues.***

Exercise increased caution in Angola due to **crime** and **health**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Violent crime, such as armed robbery, assault, carjacking, and homicide, is common. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.

Health facilities are under-resourced and may not have adequate facilities or supplies of basic vaccines or medications, especially outside of large cities.  Always travel with required medicines, including a written prescription for any prescription medicine; most medicine is unavailable, and healthcare is inconsistent.

Read the [Country Information Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Angola.html) for additional information on travel to Angola.
