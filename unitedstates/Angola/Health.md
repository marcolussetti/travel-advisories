Medical facilities and services, including emergency care, are severely limited outside of Luanda and do not meet U.S. standards. In the capital, some private clinics offer modern medical equipment, internationally trained staff, and 24-hour emergency services including ambulances, but quality and consistency of medical care varies greatly. These clinics typically require pre-payment before admission and do not accept international credit cards or private medical insurance. **We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas and U.S. embassies and consulates do not cover medical bills.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most medical providers in Angola only accept cash payments and require pre-payment for service. See our webpage for more [information on overseas insurance coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) to cover air medical evacuation.

Always carry prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Bring preventative and over-the-counter medicines. Check with the [Embassy of Angola](http://www.angola.org/) to verify your medications are legal before you travel.

Consult the [CDC website for Angola](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/angola) prior to travel.
