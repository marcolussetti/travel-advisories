For emergency services in Angola, **dial 111**, or **112** for an ambulance.

Ambulance services are

* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in Luanda
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment
* Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a UGO taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.
