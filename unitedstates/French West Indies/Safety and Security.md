# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Petty street crime, including purse snatching, does occur. Do not leave valuables unattended in public areas, unsecured hotel rooms, rental homes, or visible in vehicles.

Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. These are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law.

* Exercise caution, especially at night. Roads may be unmarked and unlit.
* Be vigilant when using public telephones or ATMs, especially in secluded areas.
* Avoid wearing expensive jewelry.
* Avoid carrying expensive objects or large amounts of cash.
* Keep doors and windows locked, especially at night.
* Use caution in dealing with beach merchants.
* For boaters: Be wary of unfamiliar persons or crafts approaching your boat, whether at anchor or at sea.

**Watersports Advisory:** Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of jet ski and boat traffic in the area. When in doubt, stay out!

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, hospitals are able provide urgent medical treatment, though very serious injuries often require medical evacuation. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
