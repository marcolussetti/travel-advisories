# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:** U.S. citizens must have a U.S. passport with at least 6 months validity to enter the French West Indies. No visa is required for stays up to 90 days if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself.  
  
**NOTE:** Caribbean cruises that begin and end in the United States (closed loop cruises) do not require that you travel with a valid passport. However, should you need to disembark due to an emergency and you do not have a valid passport, you may encounter difficulties entering or remaining in a foreign country. You may also have difficulty attempting to re-enter the United States by air because many airlines will require a valid passport before allowing you to board the aircraft. Always travel abroad with your valid passport.  
  
**HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the French West Indies.
