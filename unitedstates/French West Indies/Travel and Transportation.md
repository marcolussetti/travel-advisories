**Road Conditions and Safety:**The roads in the French West Indies are usually well paved and well maintained. Main roads are well marked; secondary roads and tourist sites are adequately marked. Excellent maps are available and local residents are helpful. Both Martinique and Guadeloupe have expressways. Traffic safety is enforced by the police. Night driving can be dangerous, especially in the mountains and on winding rural roads.

Please refer to our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/other-legal/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving is on the right-hand side of the road. Children under 12 are not legally allowed in the front seat. Seatbelt laws are strictly enforced.

For specific information concerning French West Indies driver's permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, contact the [French National Tourist Organization](http://www.france.fr/fr) offices.  
  
**Public Transportation:** Public transportation consists of taxis, vans, and buses, all of which are relatively safe.
