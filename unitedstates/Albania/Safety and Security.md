# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Some terrorist groups, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using less sophisticated methods of attack. Those include knives, firearms, and vehicles to target crowds. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security and to take special caution at:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:**Street crime occurs in urban areas, mostly at night. Burglaries, theft, and domestic violence are most common. U.S. citizens can become victims due to circumstance or proximity. Anti-American sentiment is rare in Albania and the international community is generally well regarded.   
Attacks involving small improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur often and are usually connected to disputes related to organized crime or drug trafficking. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant when parking in unattended parking areas. Avoid parking overnight in non-secure areas and inspect vehicles for suspicious items. If you find something strange, do not tamper with it. Contact the Albanian Police immediately. Carjacking is rare in Albania, but vehicle theft may occur. Make sure your vehicle is locked and keep your possessions well hidden in the trunk. Incidents of violent crime include:

* attempted murder,
* robberies by force and
* armed robberies.

Law enforcement’s ability to protect and assist travelers is limited in some areas, especially in remote regions.  Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings and be vigilant in areas without police or emergency services.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. Protests are generally peaceful but have become violent in the past. Molotov cocktails are common during demonstrations, though they are generally thrown at buildings and not people.  
Demonstrations and protests may take place in response to:

* political or economic issues,
* on politically significant holidays, and
* during international events.

Be aware of your surroundings:

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112 or 129 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(355) 4 224 7285. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention if needed and are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy.  
  
See our webpage on help for [U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).  
  
The Embassy may be able to assist crime victims with the following:

* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to the police.
* Contact relatives or friends with your written consent.
* Provide general information about the victim’s role during the local investigation.
* Follow the investigation until its conclusion.
* Provide a list of local attorneys.
* Provide our information on [victim’s compensation programs in the U.S](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).
* Provide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States. And provide limited medical support in cases of destitution.
* Replace a stolen or lost passport.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the [Embassy](https://al.usembassy.gov/services/#emergencyassistance) for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated, but rules may be unevenly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signs. In the event of an injury, access to appropriate medical treatment may be sporadic due to limited hours or physical distances. Outside metropolitan areas, it may take more time to reach first responders or medical professionals who can provide assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
