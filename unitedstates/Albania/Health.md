For emergency services in Albania, dial 112 for an ambulance. Dial 127 or 128 for the Fire Department. Dial 112 or 129 for police. Not all operators speak English, but they will attempt to connect you with an English-speaking responder when possible.

Ambulance services are not widely available. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Visit the U.S. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/) for insurance information before traveling overseas.

We strongly recommend you obtain [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations**

**Air Quality**

Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/) for information on air quality. Air quality varies throughout Albania. Pollution can be a problem particularly in Tirana. During certain times of year, such as winter, wood or coal may be burned for heat.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Albania.

**Health Facilities**

The U.S. Embassy maintains information on doctors and hospitals [here](https://al.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

* Adequate health facilities are available in Tirana. In rural areas health care may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics lack many basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always accepted.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Medical staff may not speak English.
* Most public hospitals are minimally staffed overnight in non-emergency wards. If you are caring for someone who is hospitalized overnight, consider hiring a private nurse or have family spend the night with the patient, especially children.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in cities. Hospital-based care is only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Albanian law prohibits the import and export of narcotic medications and psychotropic substances. For more information, visit the [General Directorate of Customs website](https://dogana.gov.al/english/c/168/177/239/narcotics-and-psychotropic-substances-and-human-trafficking).
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication in Albania. Many medicines are available without a prescription. However, some medications may require a prescription from a physician and are sold only at specialized pharmacies.  Some medications may not be available locally.
* Make sure to purchase medication from a reputable establishment recommended to you by a medical professional.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Food and Drug Administration have strict rules for transporting medication to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their legal requirements to be brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) websites for more information.
