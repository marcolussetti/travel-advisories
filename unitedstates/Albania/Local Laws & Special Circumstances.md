# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be fined, arrested, imprisoned, or deported.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://al.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**  Counterfeit and pirated goods may still be illegal according to local laws.  You may have to pay fines or give up such goods if you bring them back to the United States. The import and export of goods infringing on intellectual property rights is [prohibited by law](https://dogana.gov.al/english/c/168/178/counterfeit-and-pirated-goods#:~:text=Travelers%20can%20not%20import%20and,infringe%20the%20intellectual%20property%20rights.). See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Albania, but Albanian law does not permit same-sex marriage, and it does not legally recognize other countries’ same-sex marriage certificates. Albania will not issue family residency permits to same-sex married couples, but will accept individual registrations. Homophobic attitudes remain despite the law and official support for LGB rights.

Newer buildings may offer accessible facilities, but public buildings are mostly inaccessible. Accessibility is limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There are limited accessible options for travelers outside of Tirana. Aids, equipment, and devices, and rental, repair, or replacement services, are not generally available. Service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, are not generally available.
