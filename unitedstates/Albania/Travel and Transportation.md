**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving conditions in Albanian can differ significantly from those in the United States. Reckless driving is common. Drivers do not pay attention to traffic regulations. Many do not pay attention to signals, lane markings, pedestrians, or other drivers. The number of fatalities from traffic accidents is higher than other European countries. Road conditions vary. They are poor in rural areas in winter months and during inclement weather. Older sections of the roadway system are poorly lit. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed.

* All international driving permits (IDP) issued under the 1949 Geneva Convention are accepted. An international driving permit can only be used for one year. If you wish to drive in Albania for more than one year, you must apply for an Albanian license.
* In Albania, **driving is on the right-hand side of the road**. Everyone in the vehicle must wear a seat belt. Mobile phones can be used while driving, but only with a hands-free set. Third-party insurance is required.
* Be aware emergency response services are inadequate. First responders have limited medical training and equipment. Accident victims are often transported to the nearest hospital in the car of a passerby.
* Do not travel at night. Travel outside of urban areas is particularly dangerous.
* Fuel and repair services are common in populated areas. There is no formal roadside assistance. Tires and replacement parts may not be available.

**Traffic Laws:** You may be asked to show your passport in addition to a U.S. or international driver’s license if stopped. Police should provide you with a written ticket citing any fine issued. Procedures vary by district. You should not pay fines directly to police officers. Fines will be collected at a local police precinct or court.

* If you have an accident, do not move your car, and wait for police to arrive.
* Disregard for traffic laws is widespread.
* You can use a U.S. or [international driver’s license](http://www.aaasouth.com/) while in a non-resident status in Albania. U.S. citizens residing in Albania longer than one year must register and apply for resident status. They must also apply for an Albanian driver’s license.
* It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol at any detectable level.  Albania practices a zero-tolerance policy.  The police will seize your driver’s license and vehicle if caught. You may also be fined or receive up to six months in prison.
* It is against the law to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving. You will be fined if caught.

**Public Transportation:**Public transportation options are limited. Uber and other ride-hailing services do not exist; however, marked taxis are considered safe and recommended for use.

* There are no commercial domestic flights.
* Rail conditions are poor, limited, and service is unreliable.
* Intra-city and inter-city buses are regulated by the Albanian authorities and are generally considered safe, though it is recommended that travelers complete inter-city travel during daylight hours.
