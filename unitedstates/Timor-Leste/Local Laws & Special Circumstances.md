# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

If you are suspected of criminal activity, you may be incarcerated for up to one year pending investigation.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:**

Timor-Leste continues to develop and strengthen its civil and governmental institutions. If you encounter problems while traveling or doing business in Timor-Leste you may find it difficult to identify legal or administrative remedies.

**Currency:**The U.S. dollar is the official currency of Timor-Leste. Only a few establishments accept credit cards, usually requiring a substantial additional fee, and you should be prepared to settle all bills in cash. Dili has several ATMs that accept U.S.-issued bankcards, which are frequently inoperative and can charge high fees.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex sexual relations or the organization of events or materials depicting or supporting lesbian, gay, or bisexual persons in Timor-Leste. Since 2009, the penal code specifies that crimes motivated by the victim’s sexual orientation (as well as ethnicity, religion, disability, etc.) may be subject to higher penalties. Although there are some openly gay public personalities, LGB individuals generally maintain very low profiles. Several human rights organizations focused on sexual orientation exist. There have been no formal reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation, though discrimination may be underreported due to the lack of recourse stemming from the absence of formal legal protections.

Seeour [LGB Travelers Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Timor-Leste prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Timor-Leste does not currently have legislation that mandates access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. Currently most public places and public transportation are not accessible. Persons with disabilities will face difficulties in Timor-Leste as foot paths, rest rooms, road crossings, and tourist areas are not equipped to accommodate people with disabilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:** Timor-Leste is socially conservative. Travelers should avoid wearing revealing clothing, particularly in crowded public areas such as markets. Timor-Leste has a very high rate of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence.
