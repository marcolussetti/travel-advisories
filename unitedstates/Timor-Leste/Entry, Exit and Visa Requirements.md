# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

You need a passport valid for six months beyond the date of arrival in Timor-Leste. Travelers arriving by air may obtain a 30-day tourist visa-on-arrival for a fee of 30 USD. Travelers have the option to extend this visa for an additional 30 days, provided they apply at least 15 days prior to the expiration of their current visa. Forms to apply for the extension are available at the office of the Ministry of Interior in Dili.

If entering Timor-Leste by land, you will need to apply in advance at the Timor-Leste Consulate in Kupang, Indonesia for a “Visa Application Authorization.” When you arrive at the border, the “Visa Application Authorization” must be presented to an immigration official. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months and you must pay 30 USD to receive a visa. Visas on arrival at the land border with Indonesia are no longer available.

Visit the [Embassy of Timor-Leste website](http://www.timorlesteembassy.org/) for the most current visa information.

Please note, however, that Timor-Leste’s immigration policies are subject to change at any time, and that the Immigration Department’s website may not reflect the current policies.
