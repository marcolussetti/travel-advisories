Limited emergency medical care is available in Dili and options for routine medical care throughout the rest of the country are extremely limited. Serious medical problems may require medical evacuation..

For emergency services in Timor-Leste, dial 110, +670 331-1044, or +670 723-3212 and ask for an ambulance.

Ambulance services are unreliable in most areas. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [government of Timor-Leste](https://timor-leste.gov.tl/?lang=en) to ensure the medication is legal in Timor-Leste.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Visit [AirNow Department of State](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates) for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulatesand [ZephAir](https://zephair.stategdi.cloud/locations) for additional locations.Air pollution is a significant problem in major cities in Timor-Leste. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. Consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://tl.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/263/Medical-Providers-List.pdf). We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.

Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment. Medical staff may speak little or no English. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in larger cities. Hospital-based care is only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals:**Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:**In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**Some parts of Timor-Leste are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.
