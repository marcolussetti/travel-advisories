# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

While the security situation has improved, underlying tensions persist, especially during elections, though no significant violence has occurred since 2012.

You should exercise caution, use common sense, avoid large gatherings, remain alert with regard to your personal security and avoid travel after dark. Exercise caution in public places, including, but not limited to, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreational events, hotels, resorts and beaches, and other locations frequented by foreigners.

You should review U.S. Embassy [security messages](https://tl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) and maintain a high level of security awareness while moving around the country.

Timorese security forces occasionally establish official security checkpoints along roads. You may be expected to show your passport at these checkpoints.

**Crime:**Pick-pocketing, purse snatching, residential and automobile break-ins, and theft occur, especially in Dili. These crimes often happen in recreational areas and facilities frequented by foreigners. Victims of crime who resist may face physical violence by perpetrators.

Stone-throwing attacks on vehicles can occur during gang conflicts and periods of civil unrest. Avoid travel at night or alone in unfamiliar areas. Women should avoid traveling or taking taxis alone, especially at night. Women walking or exercising alone in Dili have reported harassment, indecent exposure, and groping incidents.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +670-7723-1328.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.
