# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**All traffic operates on the left side of the road, and most vehicles use right-hand drive.

* Roads are often poorly maintained and four-wheel drive may be required in some areas.
* Sparse or non-existent lighting and poor road conditions make driving at night hazardous. Many cars and motorcycles operate at night without lights.
* Driving in Dili is especially hazardous, with large trucks, buses, and mikrolets sharing the streets with vendors and pedestrians.
* During the rainy season from November to May, rain showers can severely damage cross-island roadways, making roads particularly risky. You should use caution when traveling on the cross-island roadways in the mountain areas of Aileu, Ermera, Manatuto, Ainaro, and Manufahi districts.

Roadside assistance is limited in Timor-Leste, particularly in rural areas. If you are involved in a traffic accident, you should contact the police. Bystanders sometimes attack the driver perceived to be responsible for a traffic accident. If you believe that there is a threat of bodily harm from people at the scene of the accident, it is advisable to drive to the nearest police station before stopping.

**Traffic Laws:**

* While vehicle insurance is required in Timor-Leste, compliance with this rule is limited and many drivers are uninsured. Most traffic accidents are settled informally between those involved.

**Public Transportation:**

* Taxis, small buses, and mini-vans provide public transportation in Dili and elsewhere.
* Public transportation is generally overcrowded, uncomfortable, and below international safety standards.
* Yellow taxis do not operate on meters and passengers are advised to negotiate fares before getting in to avoid disagreements about fares, which have occasionally led to hostilities.
* Blue taxis also operate in Dili and have meters to determine fares
* Public transport is generally inadvisable and usually unavailable after dark, although taxis are occasionally available at select locations.
