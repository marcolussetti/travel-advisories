# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Travelers to Niger are urged to exercise extreme caution due to the risk of terror attacks and kidnapping threats against Westerners. U.S. citizens should reduce exposure to locations frequented by Westerners such as restaurants and nightclubs. Visitors are urged to stay in hotels with armed Nigerien security presence.

Due to security threats, the U.S. Embassy restricts the travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors outside of Niamey. These restrictions may limit the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist visitors in these areas.

The border region with Mali continues to be of specific concern. There are frequent and ongoing reports of terrorists and affiliates crossing into and through Niger from Mali. A U.S. citizen was kidnapped from the area in October 2016.

Niger’s southeastern border with Nigeria and east of Maradi are poorly controlled. Boko Haram and several factions affiliated with ISIS have conducted cross-border attacks into Niger. The Government of Niger has increased its security forces in the border areas, but the situation remains unstable and travel is not advised.

For travel in any remote area of the country, the Department of State urges travelers to use guides and to travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones.

Street demonstrations occur frequently in Niger. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Refer to the [U.S. Embassy Niger website](https://ne.usembassy.gov/) for the most updated safety and security information.

**Crime:**  Thefts and petty crimes are common day or night. Tourists should not walk alone in Niger, but areas in Niamey near the Gaweye Hotel, the National Museum, the Petit Marché, and on or near the Kennedy Bridge are of particular concern. In general, walking at night is not recommended.

Counterfeit and pirated goods are available, but transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. Carrying them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines.

**Victims of Crime:**

If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. There is no local equivalent to a “911” emergency line in Niger. U.S. citizens can try calling local police by dialing “17” on Nigerien phones or +227-20-72-25-53, but calls to these numbers often go unanswered, especially outside of normal working hours. The Embassy highly recommends hiring guards for your residence if you are planning to live in Niger.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
