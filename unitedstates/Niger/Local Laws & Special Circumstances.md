# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers:** There is strong societal stigma against same-sex sexual activity in Niger, but no laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity in general.  The law states, however, that an “unnatural act” with a person of the same sex who is under 21 is punishable by six months to three years in prison and a fine of between 9,000 and 90,000 CFA francs ($16-$160).

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our  [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Dress restrictions:** Local culture and Islamic tradition encourage conservative dress for both men and women. There have been incidents of groups of men assaulting women who appear to be African and who are wearing clothing other than traditional garments.

**Photography restrictions:**Tourists are free to take pictures anywhere in Niger, except near military installations, radio and television stations, the Presidential Palace, airports, or diplomatic facilities. Tourists should not photograph military or police personnel, or political or student demonstrations, and should seek prior permission before taking a close-up “portrait” photo of an individual.

**Currency regulations:**Niger shares the West African Franc (CFA) with several other West African countries. The CFA may be converted into dollars. Foreign currency exchange over 1 million CFA (about $1,900 at an exchange rate of about 530 CFA/$1) requires authorization from the Ministry of Finance (forms available from all major banks).

**Telephone service:** Due to poor line quality, callers often experience delays in getting a telephone line, and faxes are often unclear. Service quality is generally better with cellular service, which is available from multiple providers in urban areas. Connections between cell phones and land lines are often poor quality and may fail to connect at all.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Nigerien law mandates that the state provide for persons with physical and mental disabilities, but there are no specific regulations mandating accessibility to buildings, transportation, and communication for those with special needs. There is extremely limited accessibility to public transportation, road crossings, taxis, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other tourist spots.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page.

**Women Travelers:** Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Niger is punished by a fine and a jail sentence. Between 1998 and 2006 the practice of FGM on girls aged 15 to 49 was reduced by 50% (5% to 2.2%) although ethnic and regional disparities remain, with a pocket of the most intense FGM practice persisting in far Western Niger. Forced marriage or marriage without the consent of one or both parties still happens in Niger, and victims are often minor 15-18 year old girls. Women have limited access to education and employment (less than 15% of women can read.)
