[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** For current traffic regulations, see the [Ministry of Interior’s Traffic Police](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/wps/portal/MOIInternet/departmentcommittees/gatraffic) website.

**Driving:** The legal minimum driving age is 18.  Holders of a U.S. issued driver’s license can drive in Qatar for two weeks, but most car rental agencies require an international driver’s license. Three-month Temporary Licenses are available.  International Driving Licenses are valid in Qatar for six months from the date of arrival.  Resident expatriates should apply for a full Qatari license. If you are caught operating a vehicle without a valid license, penalties can be severe.  For more information, see the [Qatari Traffic Services website](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/wps/portal/MOIInternet/departmentcommittees/gatraffic/!ut/p/a1/tVJNc5swFPwtOXDEeiDAIjfFTWyDXSexnQQuHQEPrAwIDKqTya-P4vbQ6eSjmUl1etLs29ldLUnJHUmVOMhKaNkqUb_c0-DH9xC4E64gXm24Gc-nN9uJx1wIXQNIDGDOmTdzwInZDBjw9SbanK0mLoDz0f4tSUmaK93pHUke8qaWmS2Vxl6htlFZMAi7wE70ukGl87ZppNaIFlSosBe1KBqp5KD7o-K2NENZytyC3Al96r2wd7ksSCKCAhH8wC6FV9oeLTI7zOnYFi4rgxJ85vrBLzVGcDT7Nge6hni6CKjxs1hO3MkVAPN_A94zfATAG4cDiUha1W12TDfhKqOsImmPJfbYj3725nmndTecWmCBsXPAejRooXFUtQcLXlvatYMmd39jSWL-ZvxH-G7kAd8u44uz-JKufErWn4znXUIWjb-a0P80YfQPfZX3-33KTeta07NHE9x_qF3XbBtGg-vZ0wJvbZExoH53eFpwfnLyDI00e8I!/?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Fwcmlib-internet-en%2Fsa-departmentcommittee%2Fgeneraladministrationoftraffic%2Fdrivers%2Blicense).

**Traffic accidents** are one of the leading causes of death in Qatar. The extensive use of roundabouts, numerous road construction projects, and high-speed driving can be challenging. In rural areas, poor lighting, wandering camels, and roads without shoulders create hazards.  If you are in an accident without a license, any insurance may be held invalid, and you could be left with extensive bills and legal charges.

**Avoid arguments over traffic incidents**. Qatari citizens who feel insulted can file a police complaint that can result in your arrest and overnight detention. Drivers are liable for persons injured in a traffic accident. Local police have held U.S. citizens overnight while ascertaining the extent of injuries.

**Traffic Fines:** Please be aware that traffic offenses are easily captured via well-placed cameras and the fines can be expensive. Unpaid traffic fines can result in an exit ban until reconciled.

**Public Transportation:** Regulated and registered taxi services (Uber, Karwa, Fox Transportation, and Careem) are widely available and generally safe to use. The Embassy recommends you avoid use unlicensed taxi operators or drivers who approach you and attempt to solicit business. Do not allow the driver to pick up additional passengers along the way. To avoid cultural misunderstandings, females traveling alone should always sit in the back (never the front) seat.

[Qatar Rail](https://www.qr.com.qa/home): The Doha Metro is safe, modern, and inexpensive.

[Mowasalat Public Bus](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Qatar.html#ExternalPopup): Laborers and construction workers predominantly use this mode of public transportation. The front seats in the buses are generally reserved for women and children. The U.S. Embassy recommends the use of regulated taxi services rather than public buses.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Qatar’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Qatar should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal).
