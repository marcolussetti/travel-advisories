# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Exit bans** prevent those faced with legal proceedings from leaving Qatar until their case is abandoned or resolved.  This can take months or years. The Government of Qatar does not offer any social support for individuals under exit bans.

Reasons for exit bans can include:

* Labor or financial disputes
* Personal debt (including bounced checks, credit card debt, and bank loans)
* Outstanding contracts or leases
* Traffic fines
* Pending legal matters, including cases related to gestures or behavior reported by Qataris that are viewed as “offensive.”

**U.S. citizens have been subjected to exit bans and/or placed in prison pending payment of debts.**

Always carry a copy of your passport for proof of identity, or authorities may detain you for questioning.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, deported, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

Criminal penalties for certain offenses are much harsher than those in the U.S.:

* **Incidents involving obscene language, gestures, or insulting comments often result in arrest, imprisonment, and/or fines.**
* **Alcohol-Related Offenses,** including public intoxication, can result in severe penalties such as arrest, heavy fines, imprisonment, and/or deportation.  Qatar maintains a zero-tolerance policy against drinking and driving.
* **Use of Illegal Drugs** can result in long jail sentences and steep fines.

**Arrest Notification:** Qatari authorities do not routinely notify the U.S. Embassy of a U.S. citizen’s arrest. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are not allowed to do so, ask a friend or family member to contact the U.S. Embassy.  See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

For more serious crimes, Qatari authorities may not allow U.S. Embassy officials to visit until the initial interrogation is completed.

**Qatari police sometimes arrest U.S. citizens without providing access to legal counsel.** You could be arrested for being a:

* Potential witness to a crime (including traffic accidents involving injuries; slander, traffic arguments, etc.)
* Relative of a suspect
* Criminal Suspect

**If arrested—regardless of the charge—you may spend 1-2 nights in jail before a hearing takes place.** Once arrested, only the Qatari Public Prosecution and Courts have the authority to grant a release.

See our [webpage](https://qa.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Qatari law favors employers over employees.** In the event of a contract or employment dispute, Qatari authorities refer to the Arabic language of a contract. Employees have limited recourse if their employer terminates a contract early. If a sponsor files a complaint against an employee who departed Qatar, the employee may be barred from returning to Qatar, even on a tourist or airport visa. Many terminated U.S. citizens have been barred from departing Qatar because of pre-existing debt.

Despite recent legal changes, transferring employment prior to the end of a contract often requires the permission of the previous employer and is subject to approval by the Ministry of the Interior. Additional mechanisms for transferring employers exist through the Ministry of Interior in cases such as bankruptcy, abuse, or repeated failure to pay an employee on time.

**Drug Use:** Most drugs that are illegal in the United States are also illegal in Qatar, including marijuana/THC, CBD products, and vape products. The potential consequences for use or possession may be harsh.

**Clothing**: Many public areas in Qatar have dress codes that require both men and women cover shoulders, chests, stomachs, and knees, and that tight leggings be covered by a long shirt or dress. Attire standards can vary between neighborhoods and facilities.  **Faith-Based Travelers:** Religion is a very sensitive issue in Qatar; treat any discussions on religion with care and caution. The law provides for a prison sentence of up to seven years for defaming, desecrating, or committing blasphemy against Islam, Christianity, or Judaism. Public worship by non-Islamic faiths and atheism are illegal and subject to prosecution.

**Proselytizing is against the law.** Attempts to covert a member of another religion or even “share your faith” can be considered “proselytizing.” Penalties can include deportation or imprisonment.

While you may import religious material for personal use, **bringing religious materials into the country for proselytizing purposes is prohibited.**

Charitable activities, both religious and non-religious, must be approved in advance by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

**LGB Travelers:** Same-sex sexual relations between men are illegal, even if consensual. Penalties include lashing, lengthy prison sentences and/or deportation.

There is no law criminalizing same-sex sexual relations between women, though cultural norms are conservative.

Businesses are prohibited from selling and individuals are prohibited from distributing rainbow colored merchandise.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Qatar prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, the law is not enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/student-travel-brochure-pdf.pdf/view).

**Women Travelers:** Unaccompanied expatriate women may be verbally and/or physically harassed. In deference to Islamic culture, avoid wearing sleeveless shirts, halter-tops, or shorts. Only wear athletic clothing in public when engaged in sports activities.

**Journalists**: Journalists, including independent content creators and vloggers, need specific visas and permissions to use photography and videography equipment, or to conduct interviews or reporting within Qatar. There is no legal guarantee of press freedom or freedom of expression in Qatar.

**Photography**: Photographing local people in Qatar, particularly women, is illegal without permission.
