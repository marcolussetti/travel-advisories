# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Tourist visas:** When traveling on a U.S. tourist passport, travelers may obtain a visa upon arrival, with a cost of $21 per person, if they have six-months validity in their passport and a return or onward ticket. The visa is valid for 90 days from the date of issuance and entitles the holder to spend up to 90 days in Qatar, or multiple entries during the 90-day validity. It may be extended. See the Government of Qatar’s website for [visa information](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/qatarvisas/).

**Former Residency Permit Holders:** Former resident permit holders seeking to return to Qatar should carry a “no objection letter” issued by their former sponsor.

For further information on residence permits, see the [Qatari government](https://portal.moi.gov.qa/qatarvisas/) or [U.S. Embassy website](https://qa.usembassy.gov/services/#local).

**Exit Permits:**

* Exit permits are no longer required for U.S. citizens working in Qatar, with the exception of employees deemed “essential” by their employers, who must still be granted an exit permit.
* If you owe money, you will be barred from exiting Qatar. Qatari banks place holds on accounts to ensure all debts are paid before you leave.
* U.S. citizens with family residence visas do not need an exit permit. However, a family member who sponsors their dependents (usually the person employed in Qatar) can elect to receive instant notification if dependents attempt to depart the country.

**Qatar does not recognize dual nationality.** If you hold Qatari citizenship, Qatari law requires that you enter and exit on your Qatari passport. Qatari authorities may confiscate your U.S. passport if you hold Qatari/U.S. dual nationality. Should this happen, contact the U.S. Embassy. The seizure does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship.

**Military Personnel** should consult the Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide before traveling, since different entry/exit requirements may apply. For further information, call the Host Nation Coordination Cell of the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing at 011-974-5551-0815.

**Some restrictions** exist for foreign residents of Qatar who test positive for certain communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDs. Medical exams are required for individuals seeking residency in Qatar, but not for transit passengers or short-term visitors.  Qatari authorities will not bar HIV-positive temporary visitors from entry to Qatar based on their health status.  However, Qatar denies residency and employment to HIV or tuberculosis-positive applicants (among other communicable diseases).  Short-term visitors to Qatar with medications on their person are advised to carry a copy of their prescriptions. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Qatar](https://washington.embassy.qa/en) before you travel.

**Customs** regulations prohibit the import of alcohol over the duty-free cap, narcotics, pork products, weapons or weapons-related articles (hand cuffs, laser pointers, etc.), drones, professional photography equipment to include telescopic lenses, as well as pornographic or sexually-related materials.

See Qatar’s [website](https://www.customs.gov.qa/english/pages/default.aspx) for specific information regarding customs requirements.
