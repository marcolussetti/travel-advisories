**COVID-19 Testing**

COVID-19 tests are available from many local medical providers and hospitals. Testing is paid for by the individual or, in some instances, their insurance plan or employer. Private hospitals charge QR 50 - 160 test. Test results are usually provided by email, but some clinics require you to pick up the travel certificate in person. Please refer to the [Ministry of Public Health’s webpage](https://covid19.moph.gov.qa/EN/covid19-testing/Pages/default.aspx) for additional information.

**COVID-19 Vaccines**

The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Qatar. Please refer to the [Ministry of Public Health’s webpage](https://covid19.moph.gov.qa/EN/Covid19-Vaccine/Pages/vaccination-appointment.aspx) for additional information.

Visit the FDA's website to learn more about [FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

Modern medical facilities and Western-style pharmacies are available. Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash payment for health services.

For information on the Qatari national healthcare system, see the [Qatar Ministry of Health website](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/default.aspx).

Ambulance services are widely available.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Some prescription medications from the United States are unavailable or restricted in Qatar, for example, stimulants, strong pain medications, and some medications used by HIV+ patients. Check with the [Qatari customs authority](https://www.customs.gov.qa/english/pages/default.aspx) on proper travel procedures and the [Ministry of Public Health](https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/default.aspx) to ensure the medication is legal in Qatar. Discuss a health care plan with your doctor before you travel.

**Contraceptives, Pregnancy, and Prenatal Care**

Sexual intercourse outside of marriage is illegal in Qatar.  As such, pregnant women must present a marriage certificate to receive prenatal care at medical facilities in Qatar.  Unmarried pregnant women should consult the U.S. Embassy prior to pursuing prenatal care in Qatar. Contraceptives are available over the counter with no prescription required. Emergency contraceptives are not available. We advise all travelers to plan accordingly.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
