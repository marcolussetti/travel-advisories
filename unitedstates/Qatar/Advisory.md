Exercise normal precautions in Qatar.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) for the region, including Qatar.  This is due to risks to civil aviation from political and military tensions in the region.  The notice advises U.S. operators to review current threat information and to report safety or security incidents. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).
