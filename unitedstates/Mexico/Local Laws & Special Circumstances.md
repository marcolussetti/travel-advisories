# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mexico.html#ExternalPopup) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

The Mexican government is required by international law to contact the U.S. Embassy or consulate promptly when a U.S. citizen is arrested if the arrestee so requests.  This requirement does not apply to dual nationals.

**Firearms and Other Weapons:**Weapons laws in Mexico vary by state, but it is generally illegal for travelers to carry weapons of any kind including firearms, knives, daggers, brass knuckles, as well as ammunition (even used shells). Illegal firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico is a major concern, and the Department of State warns all U.S. citizens against taking any firearm or ammunition into Mexico. If you are caught entering Mexico with any type of weapon, including firearms or ammunitions, you likely will face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Mexico.  Visit the Department’s [Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).

Vessels entering Mexican waters with firearms or ammunition on board must have a permit previously issued by a Mexican embassy or consulate.

**Drugs:**Drug possession and use, including medical marijuana, is illegal in Mexico and may result in a lengthy jail sentence or fines.

**Electronic Cigarettes (Vaping Devices):** It is illegal for travelers to bring electronic cigarettes (vaping devices) and all vaping solutions to Mexico. Customs will confiscate vaping devices and solutions and travelers could be fined or arrested. Avoid delays and possible sanctions by not taking these items to Mexico.

**Real Estate and Time Shares:**U.S. citizens should exercise caution when considering time-share investments or purchasing real estate and be aware of the aggressive tactics used by some sales representatives. Before initiating a real estate purchase or time-share investment, U.S. citizens should consult with a Mexican attorney to learn about important regulations and laws that govern real estate property.

**Mountain Climbing and Hiking:**The Mexican government has declared the area around the Popocatepetl and the Colima volcanoes off limits. In remote rural areas, there can be limited cell phone coverage and internet connectivity, and it may be difficult for rescue teams and local authorities to reach climbers and hikers in distress.

**Potential for Natural Disasters:**Mexico is in an active earthquake zone. Tsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes. Please visit our [disaster and crisis preparedness](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) webpage for more information. For additional information concerning disasters, see:

* [U.S. Embassy Mexico City website](https://mx.usembassy.gov/)
* [Civil Protection](https://www.proteccioncivil.cdmx.gob.mx/) (*Proteccion Civil, Spanish only*) provides information from the Mexican Government about natural disaster preparedness
* [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness
* [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity

**Storm Season:**Tropical storms can produce heavy winds and rain between May and November. Please visit our disaster and crisis preparedness webpage for more information.

**Spring Break:**Millions of U.S. citizens visit Mexican beach resorts each year, especially during “[spring break](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/students-abroad/pdfs/Springbreak-v1.pdf.)” season. The legal drinking age in Mexico is 18. See the “Alcohol” section above to learn more about the risks associated with drinking, as well as reports of illnesses associated with the possible consumption of unregulated alcohol.

**Resort Areas and Water Activities:**Beaches in Mexico may be dangerous due to strong currents, rip tides, and rogue waves. Warning notices and flags on beaches should be taken seriously. Not all hazardous beaches are clearly marked. If black or red warning flags are up, do not enter the water. Strong currents can lead to dangerous conditions for even the most experienced swimmers. U.S. citizens simply walking along the shore or wading have been swept out to sea by rogue waves, and some citizens have drowned or disappeared at Mexican beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while engaging in water activities and do not swim alone.

Boats used for excursions may not be covered by accident insurance and sometimes lack adequate life jackets, radios, and tools to make repairs.  Participation in adventure sports may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards.  Visit [our website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about adventure travel.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also be subject to fines or forced to relinquish the goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/)for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or on the organization of LGB events in Mexico. However, due to sporadic reports of violence targeting LGB individuals, U.S. citizens should exercise discretion in identifying themselves publicly as LGB. See our LGB Travel Information page and Section 6 of the [Department of State’s Human Rights Report for Mexico](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  Mexican law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in more rural and remote parts of the country, and more common in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in major cities.  U.S. citizens with disabilities should consult individual hotels and service providers in advance of travel to ensure they are accessible.

**Students:**See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/travel/cna_pdf/student-travel-brochure-pdf%20(1).pdf).

**Women Travelers:**There were several reports of sexual assault or domestic violence involving U.S. citizen women over the past year. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/Women.html).
