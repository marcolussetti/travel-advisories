[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Excellent health facilities are available in Mexico City and other major cities. Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi to a health provider. Mexican facilities often require payment “up front” before providing medical care, and most hospitals in Mexico do not accept U.S. health insurance. A [list of doctors and hospitals](https://mx.usembassy.gov/medical-practitioners/) is available on the U.S. Embassy or consulate website.

U.S. citizens have lodged complaints against some private hospitals in Cancun, the Riviera Maya, and Los Cabos to include exorbitant prices and inflexible collection measures.  Travelers should obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care in these locations.  Be aware that some resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers and ambulance services, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.  Some hospitals in tourist centers utilize sliding scales, deciding on rates for services based on negotiation and on the patient’s perceived ability to pay.  In some instances, providers have been known to determine the limits of a patient’s credit card or insurance, quickly reach that amount in services rendered, and subsequently discharge the patient or transfer them to a public hospital.

Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) website for information on Medical Tourism.

For emergency services in Mexico, dial **911**.  Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call.

Ambulance services are:

* widely available in major cities but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards,
* not present in many remote and rural areas of the country,
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills:**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation as well.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check the [Mexican government’s Drug Schedule](http://www.csg.gob.mx/descargas/pdf/priorizacion/cuadro-basico/med/catalogo/2016/EDICION_2016_MEDICAMENTOS.pdf) to ensure the medication is legal in Mexico.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.
* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Mexico.  Several foreigners have successfully enlisted the support of [PROFECO](https://www.gob.mx/profeco) (Spanish only) in order to resolve disputes over medical services.
* Although Mexico has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely.  If you plan to undergo surgery in Mexico, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls.  Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* The Drug Enforcement Agency reports counterfeit prescription pills are sold by criminals on both sides of the border. These pills are sometimes represented as OxyContin, Percocet, Xanax, and others, and may contain deadly doses of fentanyl. Counterfeit pills are readily advertised on social media and can be purchased at small, non-chain pharmacies in Mexico along the border and in tourist areas.  U.S. citizens have become seriously ill or died in Mexico after using synthetic drugs or adulterated prescription pills.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.  Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.  Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.  Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
* Visit the [Mexican Health Department](https://www.gob.mx/salud/en)website (Spanish only) or contact the [Embassy of Mexico](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/home) in Washington, D.C., for more information about obtaining a permit to import medicine into Mexico.
* For a list of controlled substances in Mexico, visit the [COFEPRIS](https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/en)website (Spanish only) and the [Mexican Drug Schedule](http://www.csg.gob.mx/descargas/pdf/priorizacion/cuadro-basico/med/catalogo/2016/EDICION_2016_MEDICAMENTOS.pdf) (Spanish only). U.S. citizens should carry a copy of their prescription or doctor’s letter, but it is still possible that they may be subject to arrest for arriving in Mexico with substances on these lists. Note that a medicine considered “over the counter” in some U.S. states may be a controlled substance in Mexico. For example, pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in Sudafed, is considered a controlled substance in Mexico. For more information, contact the  [Embassy of Mexico](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/home)in Washington, D.C.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Mexico to have a child using assisted reproductive technology (ART) including surrogacy, visit the State Department’s [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html) for general information regarding U.S. citizenship for the child.
* Surrogacy in Mexico presents serious risks that must be considered before U.S. citizens begin the surrogacy process.
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in Mexico via ART with a gestational mother, be prepared for possible long delays to document your child’s birth in Mexico and their U.S. citizenship by obtaining a U.S. passport.
* Ensure you understand Mexican law, which varies by state. The only four states with a legal framework for surrogacy do not permit foreigners and/or same-sex couples to use the procedure. In the other 28 states, surrogacy is largely unregulated.
* In most states, Mexican courts may not enforce surrogacy agreements between non-Mexican or same-sex intending parents and a gestational mother should disputes arise, due to a lack of legal framework for surrogacy. The U.S. Embassy is aware of several cases where surrogacy agencies presented a partial, or false, interpretation of Mexican surrogacy laws.
* In most Mexican states, the gestational mother is the child’s legal parent with full parental rights, and the gestational mother’s name is typically listed on the Mexican state-issued birth certificate. In certain states, a court may amend the birth certificate to remove the name of the gestational mother.
* The U.S. Embassy is aware of cases of foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, being arrested for attempting to circumvent local law related to surrogacy.

**Carbon Monoxide**

* Many hotels and other lodgings are not equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, even if they contain sources of this potentially lethal gas. U.S. citizens have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning throughout Mexico. If your lodging is not equipped with a carbon monoxide detector, consider traveling with a portable one.

**Water Quality:**

* In many areas in Mexico, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks might be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**

* Many cities in Mexico, such as Mexico City, are at high altitude, which can lead to altitude illness. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes).

**Adventure Travel**

* Participation in adventure sports and activities may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards.  Visit [our website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) and [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information about adventure travel.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Mexico. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Private Residential Treatment Facilities:**

* These facilities provide care to U.S. citizens throughout Mexico and include child behavior modification facilities, rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living centers.
* There is a wide range in standards for education, safety, health, sanitation, immigration, and residency.  Staff licensing may not be strictly enforced or meet the standards of similar facilities in the United States.
* The State Department has received reports of abuse, negligence, or mismanagement at some of these facilities. U.S. citizens should exercise due diligence and do extensive research before selecting a residential treatment facility.
