**Common diseases**  
CDC Traveler’s Health in Mexico

**Vaccinations**Visit your doctor at least one month before traveling to Mexico to [update your vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/mexico?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).

**Emergency healthcare**Dial 911 to report emergencies in Mexico. Seek help from a Spanish speaker to place the call. Not all emergency operators are English-speaking.

Ambulance services are:

* Widely available in major cities. However, emergency responder training and availability may be below U.S. standards.
* Not available in rural or remote areas.
* Not equipped with advanced medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may reach a major hospital faster by arranging private transportation than waiting for an ambulance.

**Health facilities**  
Excellent health facilities are available in Mexico City and major cities.

* Mexican health providers usually require payment before providing medical care or before releasing you from the hospital.
* Most hospitals do not accept U.S. health insurance, including Medicare.
* Refer to this [list of doctors and hospitals](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/mexico?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) if you need healthcare in Mexico
* We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**High costs at private hospitals**Most private hospitals in Mexico charge higher than expected prices and require payment before they allow you to leave.

* Some resorts have exclusive deals with medical providers and ambulances. This can limit your choices for emergency healthcare.
* Get all billing, pricing, and medical procedure details before agreeing to any medical care.
* Some private providers may discharge a patient to the public hospital if the patient reaches credit card or medical insurance limits.

**Medical payments and insurance**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.

* U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for medical care in Mexico.
* U.S. health insurance often [does not always cover care](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) outside of the United States. Most hospitals and doctors in Mexico do not accept U.S. health insurance.
* Even if your health insurance will cover the costs of medical care in Mexico, many hospitals want up-front payment. Not all U.S. insurance companies have staff available on nights or weekends to authorize payment.
* Most care providers overseas accept cash or major credit cards.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. The CDC provides more information on types of [travel insurance](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) available.

**Medical tourism and elective surgery**Many U.S. citizens suffer serious complications or die during or after cosmetic or other elective surgery in Mexico.

* Medical tourism for affordable cosmetic, dental, or elective surgeries is rapidly growing.
* Medical systems abroad work differently than in the United States. They have different rules and regulations.
* Mexico has many elective or cosmetic surgery facilities, but quality of care varies widely.
* Before you plan any surgery in Mexico, confirm that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified. Consult with your local physician or the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information.
* Coverage for [medical evacuation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) is recommended for unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Mexico. PROFECO (Spanish only) may be able to help resolve disputes over medical services.

**Private residential treatment facilities**Private facilities in Mexico include child behavior modification, addiction rehabilitation and assisted living centers.

* Standards for education, safety, health, and sanitation vary widely.
* Staff licensing may not meet U.S. standards or be strictly enforced.
* There have been reports of abuse, negligence, or mismanagement at some facilities.
* U.S. citizens should thoroughly research and choose carefully before selecting a facility.

**Pharmaceuticals**

**Importing into Mexico**Some medicines that are sold over-the-counter in some U.S. states are controlled substances in Mexico. For example, pseudoephedrine (found in Sudafed) is illegal in Mexico.

* You could be arrested if your over the counter or prescription medicine is illegal in Mexico, even with a U.S. doctor’s letter or prescription.
* For information about what you can bring to Mexico and regulations on controlled substances in Mexico, visit the [COFEPRIS](https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/en) website (Spanish only), the [Secretary of Foreign Affairs (SRE) website](https://www.gob.mx/sre/en), and the Mexican Law of General Health’s List of Prohibited Drugs (source: LGS, Chapter V, Article 234, Spanish only)
* You may need to either leave certain medications at home in the United States, or obtain a permit to import medicine into Mexico from COFEPRIS.(Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios | Gobierno | gob.mx) (Spanish only). Please contact the [Embassy of Mexico in Washington, D.C.](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/home) or your nearest [Mexican Consulate](https://www.gob.mx/sre/documentos/list-of-mexican-consulates-in-the-united-states) for additional information.

**Purchasing in Mexico**Exercise caution when purchasing medication in Mexico. Counterfeit medication is common and may:

* Not be effective
* Not be the correct strength
* Contain dangerous ingredients.

The Drug Enforcement Agency reports that counterfeit prescription pills are sold by criminals on both sides of the border. U.S. citizens have become **seriously ill or died** in Mexico after using synthetic drugs or contaminated prescription pills.

* Counterfeit pills are often advertised on social media and sold at small pharmacies near the border and in tourist areas in Mexico.
* Pills represented as OxyContin, Percocet, Xanax, and others may contain deadly doses of Fentanyl.

**Returning to the U.S.**U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States.

* Medication purchased abroad must meet U.S. requirements to be legally brought back into the United States.
* Medication should be for personal use and must be approved by the United States.
* [Prohibited and Restricted Items](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items)

**Assisted reproductive technology (ART) and surrogacy**Access the latest information from the Department of State on [assisted reproductive technology](https://mx.usembassy.gov/surrogacy-art-and-dna-testing/) (ART) or surrogacy before you travel to Mexico.

In 2021, Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that surrogacy is constitutional but left it to the individual Mexican states to regulate the practice. However, the [vast majority](https://surrogacymiracles.mx/is-surrogacy-in-mexico-legal-a-detailed-explanation/) of Mexican states lack laws that expressly permit or regulate surrogacy, leaving parents and surrogates with no clear protections. Surrogacy agreements between foreign “intended parents” and gestational mothers are not always enforced by Mexican courts. Some U.S. citizens face long delays for court decisions on parental rights and custody.

* Delays in getting your child’s Mexican birth certificate will impact the processing of an application to document your child’s U.S. citizenship. You may be asked to provide a DNA sample to prove genetic relationships when applying for documentation of your child’s U.S. citizenship

If you choose to pursue ART or surrogacy in Mexico, consider hiring a reputable local attorney who understands Mexican law regarding ART or surrogacy.

**Food and water quality:**

* Tap water in many areas is not safe to drink.
* Bottled water is safe and should be requested at restaurants and hotels.
* You may want to request no ice in your drinks since it may be made from tap water.
* Uncooked vegetables can make you sick.

**High altitude**Many cities in Mexico, such as Mexico City, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Travel to High Altitudes (source: CDC).](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-to-high-altitudes)

**Air quality**  
[Air pollution](https://airquality.gsfc.nasa.gov/forecast) is a significant problem in several major cities in Mexico. Consult your doctor on how seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may impact your health.
