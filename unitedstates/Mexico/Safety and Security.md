**Emergency numbers**

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Dial 911** to report emergencies in Mexico. Seek help from a Spanish speaker to place the call. Not all emergency operators speak English.

**Dial 55 8526 2561** (from Mexico) for the U.S. Embassy.

**Dial 844 528 6611** (from the United States) for the U.S. Embassy.

[Contact the closest U.S. Consulate](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3jwQvR0ykztNQDDOKmfHIGfDI96-Rwxl7EoJRsgUE9xe3dQ/viewform?fbzx=1095838111506264549)

U.S. citizens in Mexico should not expect the same public health and safety standards as in the United States. Enforcement varies by location, even when standards exist. Follow health and safety precautions to reduce the risk of illness or injury.

**Crime:**Crime in Mexico is common and can be violent. This ranges from petty street crime to attacks by cartels, criminal organizations and terrorist organizations. There have been violent crimes in resort areas and tourist spots in Mexico.

* Mission Mexico has assisted U.S. citizens who were victims of armed robbery, carjacking, extortion, homicide, kidnapping, pickpocketing, and sexual assault. · Targeted killings and other cartel, criminal organizations and terrorist organizations violence result from fights over territory. This can hurt innocent bystanders.
* Travelers who experience an active shooter situation should flee or drop to the ground behind a hard barrier.
* For more details, review the Mexico Travel Advisory

**Robbery:**Robberies happen often in cities. Criminals force victims to use their debit or credit cards to withdraw money. They may also pose as taxi drivers to trick you.

To stay safe:

* Limit the cash you carry in public. · Do not hail taxis on the street. Use trusted ride-sharing apps or book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi stand.
* Ask your bank how to quickly freeze or cancel your bank and credit cards.

**Extortion:**Extortion schemes are common, such as virtual kidnapping. Criminals convince families that a relative has been kidnapped. The relative is actually safe but unreachable. In another version of virtual kidnapping, a caller tells someone who has checked into a hotel that they are in danger and must pay a ransom. The criminals try to scare the victim into not contacting police or family. They claim the cartel, criminal organization, or terrorist organization is involved and threaten violence.

To protect yourself from these schemes:

* Don’t share travel plans, your room number, or personal details with strangers.
* Don’t share business details with strangers in person or over the phone, especially when using hotel phones.
* If someone tells you your loved one has been kidnapped, try first to contact them directly and confirm whether they are safe.
* End your phone call immediately if you receive a threat.
* If someone tells you that you are in danger in a hotel, contact the front desk to report the threat, consider relocating to another hotel, and evaluate whether you should contact local authorities for more help.

**Drug smuggling:**Mexican cartels, criminal organizations and terrorist organizations are active in a violent struggle to control trafficking routes. Crime organizations may try to convince Americans to carry packages into the United States for them. They target unaware travelers who regularly cross the border to smuggle drugs.

* Monitor your vehicle closely.

Don’t agree to carry any package across the border.  
  
**Sexual assault:**Rape and sexual assault are common in some resort areas, especially at night or early morning. Criminals sometimes drug their victim’s drinks. 

* Be aware of your surroundings.
* Consider bringing a friend with you when you go out.
* Closely monitor your drinks.

**Financial scams:**Follow the Department of State guidelines to protect yourself from scams and learn how the FBI can help.

Internet financial scams are common in Mexico. Scammers often reach out through online services or unwanted emails. They may pretend to be U.S. citizens needing help. They even claim that you or a loved one may be in danger if you do not give them money. There have also been reports of banking fraud against U.S. citizens. Common scams include:

* Requests for you to help with a money transfer, promising you a share of the money.
* Notifications of supposed bank overpayments or fake inheritances. · Promises of free trips or luggage.
* Online girlfriends or boyfriends claiming they are in trouble and asking for financial help.
* Promises to help you exit your timeshare property investment in Mexico.

If you think you’ve been scammed, you can:

* File a police report.
* File a complaint with Mexico’s consumer protection agency, PROFECO (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor, Spanish only).
* File a complaint with the Mexican banking regulatory agency CONDUSEF (Comision Nacional para la Proteccion y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros, Spanish only).
* Consult an attorney.

**Credit and debit card skimming:**Fraudulent charges or cash withdrawals can occur due to “skimmed” cards.

* Use ATMs in safe, well-lit areas, ideally within banks.
* Be especially alert for skimming devices in tourist areas. These are popular targets.
* Regularly check your account for unauthorized transactions.

**Victims of crime:**When a crime occurs while traveling:

* **Dial 911** for the local authorities.
* File a report of the crime “denuncia” with the “Ministerio Publico,” similar to the office of public prosecutor or district attorney in the United States. (Note: First responders do not handle crime reports.)
* **Dial +52-55-8526-2561** for the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate to report serious crimes such as:
  + Kidnapping of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR)
  + Domestic violence
  + Sexual assault

The Department of State provides help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. The Embassy or Consulate can:

* Replace a stolen or lost passport.
* Help you find appropriate medical care.
* Assist you in reporting a crime to local authorities.
* With your written consent, contact relatives or friends.
* Provide general information about a victim’s role during local investigation and following its conclusion.
* Share a list of local attorneys.
* Issue an emergency loan for repatriation to the U.S. or limited medical support in cases of poverty.
* Help you find accommodations and arrange flights home.
* Inform you about victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.

**Carbon monoxide:**U.S. citizens have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Mexico.

* Many hotels and vacation rental properties do not have carbon monoxide detectors.
* If you are not sure that your accommodations provide one, bring a portable carbon monoxide detector.

**Demonstrations:**Demonstrations happen often, sometimes due to political or economic issues, political holidays, or international events.

* Protesters may block roads, bridges, or take over toll booths.
* If protesters ask for money at toll booths, paying usually lets you pass.

U.S. citizens should not join demonstrations, as Mexican law forbids political activities by foreigners. Joining demonstrations can lead to detention or deportation.

* Avoid areas with protests.
* Protests can be unpredictable and sometimes turn violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic news. Tourism regulations

In major cities and resorts, tourism is well-regulated and enforced through best practices and safety inspections.

* Dangerous areas and activities are marked with signs.
* In smaller towns, regulations, inspections and safety measures are limited.
* Professional staff support organized tour-group activities.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
