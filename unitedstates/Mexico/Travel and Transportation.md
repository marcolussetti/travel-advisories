**Emergency numbers  
Dial 911** for emergency services.

**Dial 078** on toll roads (“cuota”) or major highways for bilingual help from Green Angels, a Mexican government roadside assistance service.

If there are no injuries, contact your car insurance provider directly. They may come to the site’s accident and assess it right away.

**Road conditions and safety**Road conditions and surface maintenance vary across Mexico. Motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of U.S. citizen deaths in Mexico.

* Drive between cities only during the day.
* Take toll roads marked with numbers followed by a D (“cuota”) rather than free (“libre”) roads. Toll highways are more often patrolled by police.
* Travel with a charged phone that works in Mexico.
* Availability of electric vehicle charging stations varies widely.
* Do not accept rides from or offer rides to strangers in Mexico.
* Follow instructions at all checkpoints.
* Be cautious traveling in rural areas where cell phone coverage is spotty. Roadside or medical assistance is often slow to arrive.

Driving in Mexico City:

* Driving days and times are restricted in Mexico City to reduce air pollution. Restrictions happen Monday through Saturday and are based on the vehicle’s plate number.
* The Mexico City government provides more information at [Hoy No Circula](https://sma.edomex.gob.mx/hoy_no_circula#:~:text=Acuerdo%20que%20establece%20las%20medidas,atmosf%C3%A9rica%20y%20contingencias%20ambientales%20atmosf%C3%A9ricas.) (Spanish only).

**Road checkpoints**

* Drivers may come upon legal checkpoints by the National Guard, military, or police. They may also encounter illegal ones set up by criminals to stop rivals or extort money.
* When approaching any checkpoint, cooperate. Avoid any behavior that appears aggressive. Fleeing can raise suspicion and lead to violence.

**Vehicle laws**U.S. driver’s licenses are valid in Mexico. Only U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents can operate U.S.-registered vehicles.

The owner must be in the vehicle for another person to drive it. Violating this law can lead to towing and a fine equal to the value of the vehicle.

It is illegal in Mexico to:

* Drive under the influence of alcohol.
* Use a mobile device while driving.
* Drive through a yellow light.

**Car insurance and required documents**Mexican car insurance is required for all vehicles.

* Uninsured drivers involved in car accidents, major or minor, may be subject to arrest.
* Arrests can happen regardless of who is at fault.

U.S. vehicles entering Mexico must have a valid license plate and current registration sticker.

* Mexican authorities will not let you in with a temporary or paper license plate.
* Vehicles with expired registrations or unauthorized plates may be confiscated.
* The driver of an unauthorized vehicle could receive a fine equal to the value of the vehicle.

**Vehicle border permits**Temporary permits for U.S. registered vehicles are required when you drive beyond the immediate border area (approximately 12 miles into Mexico).

* Apply for the permit at Banjercito or at a Mexican consulate in the U.S.
* A valid passport and monetary deposit are required.
* You will receive your deposit back when you leave Mexico before the permit expires.
* Driving without a permit may lead to towing and a fine equal to the value of the vehicle.

**Traveling by bus**Public buses vary in security but are generally safe in Mexico City and major tourist areas. Avoid buses in Tamaulipas state as they are not generally safe.

* Protect your belongings since theft is common.
* Travel between cities only during daylight.
* For inter-city travel, first-class or “executive” buses are most direct and most reliable.

**Taxi travel**Do not hail taxis on the street. Use trusted ride-sharing apps.

* Book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi stand (“sitio”).
* Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Cabify are available and generally safe to use.
* If you are using a taxi or ride sharing app, confirm the driver’s license plate number and vehicle type to make sure you are getting into the right vehicle.
* Beware, though, that there have been violent attacks on ride-sharing app drivers by taxi drivers who see them as a threat to their business. If your ride-sharing app driver is involved in a confrontation, leave the car and seek safety.

**Aviation safety oversight**

* The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that Mexico’s Civil Aviation Authority meets international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime travel**

* If you plan to enter Mexico by sea on a privately owned vessel you need to get [a permit](https://www.gob.mx/) from the Mexican Government before traveling. For more information contact the [Embassy of Mexico](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/eua/index.php/en/home) in Washington D.C.
* Mariners and passengers planning travel to Mexico should check for [U.S. Maritime Advisories and Alerts.](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories)  Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/vdesk/webtop.eui?webtop=/PROXYU/Homeport-mmcvqr-redirect-test&webtop_type=webtop_full) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

**Maritime safety oversight**The Mexican maritime industry (charter fishing and recreational vessels) may not meet U.S. standards or have accident insurance.
