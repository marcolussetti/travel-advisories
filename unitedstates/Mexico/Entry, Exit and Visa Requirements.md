For travelers entering Mexico by air only, Mexican immigration authorities use a Forma Migratoria Multiple Digital or FMMD. Upon arrival at an airport, Mexican immigration authorities determine a traveler’s authorized length of stay and either place a date stamp in the traveler’s passport or direct the traveler through a self-service electronic gate (E-Gate) that generates a printed receipt with QR code. Air travelers who wish to download a record of their FMMD or find more information on the FMMD process may visit the [National Migration Institute’s (INM) website](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inm.gob.mx%2Fspublic%2Fportal%2Finmex.html&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1bdbb64013314e0cb1b208dcf9231446%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638659176264178969%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=kNeCib%2FNnsEIi44mD5RI5O3FXb3NeDuvVzZN8xyx7x8%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://www.inm.gob.mx/spublic/portal/inmex.html.

Travelers entering Mexico by land must have a valid passport book or card. If you enter Mexico by land you must stop at an INM office or go online to [www.inm.gob.mx/fmme](https://www.inm.gob.mx/fmme/publico/solicitud.html "Original URL: http://www.inm.gob.mx/fmme. Click or tap if you trust this link.") to obtain an entry permit (Forma Migratoria Multiple or FMM), even if not explicitly directed to do so by Mexican officials. This includes travelers within the immediate border area (approximately 12 to 20 km into Mexico). The FMM must be stamped at an INM office upon entry to and exit from Mexico. INM may opt to allow tourists entry of up to 180 days without a visa or may limit authorized stays to shorter periods at their discretion; visitors should confirm the specific length of authorized stay written on the entry permit (FMM) or by the stamp in their passport. Mexican immigration authorities may ask you to present both your passport and entry permit if applicable at any point and may detain you while they review your immigration status if you are not carrying your passport and proof of legal status in Mexico, or if you have overstayed your authorized stay. Immigration check points are common in the interior of Mexico, including in popular tourist areas far from the border.

Travelers bringing in goods beyond their personal effects (i.e.: items that go beyond the list of “What is included in your luggage” on the INM website) worth $300.00 or more when traveling by land and $500.00 or more when traveling by air must declare those goods with Mexican customs (SAT) [Mexican customs](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fomawww.sat.gob.mx%2Faduanas%2Fpasajeros%2FPaginas%2FMercancia_ingresar_Mexico.aspx&data=05%7C02%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C1bdbb64013314e0cb1b208dcf9231446%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638659176264193905%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xG6uVJTykO2kcaD367KzvFo5nHepKRwwxXTtZy3kSNM%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/aduanas/pasajeros/Paginas/Mercancia_ingresar_Mexico.aspx.

Mexican customs regulations also only allow one portable computer per passenger, per arrival, including laptops and tablets. Travelers who bring more than one device may face a duty of up to 19% of the deemed value of up to $4,000 of the device.

U.S. citizens driving such items into Mexico without declaring such items or without sufficient funds to pay duty fees are subject to having their vehicle seized by Mexican customs authorities.

To bring a U.S.-registered vehicle beyond the border zone, you will need a temporary vehicle import permit. These permits are processed through Banjercito and require a deposit that will be refunded once the vehicle leaves Mexico.

Baja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora have a “hassle-free” zone that allows cars traveling without an entry permit or car registration within the zone.

Mexican authorities can impound a vehicle that enters the country without a valid U.S. registration, a vehicle driven by a Mexican national who is not resident in the United States, or a vehicle found beyond the border zone without the temporary import permit.

Mexican law permits Mexican immigration authorities to deny foreigners entry into Mexico if they have been charged with or convicted of a serious crime in Mexico or elsewhere.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents in Mexico.

A parent or legal guardian departing Mexico with minor children should carry a notarized consent letter from the other parent if traveling separately.
