# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Tourism infrastructure
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Mortar and Rocket Fire *or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion*:** In the event of mortar or rocket fire ***or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion***, a “red alert” siren may be activated. Treat all such alerts as real. Follow the instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. U.S. government personnel and their family members may be restricted from traveling to areas affected by rocket activity, sirens, and/or the opening of bomb shelters. For additional information on appropriate action to take upon hearing a siren or explosion, see [the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command website](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/regional-commands/home-front-command/home-front-command/) (available on devices within Israel) or view the [Preparedness Information.](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fil.usembassy.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F33%2FHome_Front_Command_Preparedness_Information.pdf&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C6f806e3f127d45d020bd08db57d698d5%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638200351422234069%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=HiEsSmjDjPNSXjluLMXD8WttTdnpAw83UFrioRn3CHQ%3D&reserved=0) U.S. citizens may also wish to download the free Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command application on [Android](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/IsraeltheWestBankandGaza.html#ExternalPopup) or [Apple](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/IsraeltheWestBankandGaza.html#ExternalPopup) devices to receive real-time security and safety alerts.

**Crime:** The crime rate is moderate in Israel and the West Bank. Parked vehicle break-ins are common at public beach areas, national parks, and other tourist sites. Vehicle theft also remains a problem. U.S. citizens should not leave their valuables (including passports) unattended in parked vehicles, on the beach, or unsecured in hotels. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings in tourist areas and watch for crimes of opportunity, such as pickpockets.  The crime rate in Gaza is now unknown given the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas.

**Technology Usage Abroad**: Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices include making sure all software (operating system and apps) are updated prior to traveling abroad and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible while abroad. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS navigation applications (apps) can help you get around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without accounting for the safety of that route.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.
