For emergency services in Israel, dial 101 for ambulances, and 100 for police.

Modern medical care and medicines are available in Israel. Some hospitals in Israel, most hospitals in the West Bank, and all hospitals in Gaza, however, fall below Western standards. Travelers can find information in English about emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the *Jerusalem Post* and the English-language edition of the *Ha'aretz*newspaper, or refer to the [U.S. Embassy’s medical information list](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fil.usembassy.gov%2Fu-s-citizen-services%2Fdoctors%2F&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C6f806e3f127d45d020bd08db57d698d5%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638200351422234069%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hUUoLXa%2FjTmukfDUbn%2FoiCzBqZ7rNR8SJzmdPS8GHK8%3D&reserved=0).

Ambulance services are widely available in Israel. Ambulance services in the West Bank are available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. The U.S. government does not have knowledge of the standards of ambulance services in Gaza, but their capabilities have been degraded by the ongoing armed conflict between Hamas and Israel. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) operates in the West Bank and Gaza.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s entire [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Israel.Traveler Advice for Israel.

* Select your destination in the [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/). Review all sub-sections including the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.

Review the [Traveler Advice webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) that provides advice on medical considerations including:

* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
* Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
* and General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage for places you are traveling overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage on insurance coverage overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) (see our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Israel [Ministry of Health](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/ministry_of_health/govil-landing-page) to ensure the medication is legal in Israel.

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout Israel but health care in the West Bank may be below U.S. standards. Health care in Gaza has been severely degraded by the ongoing military conflict between Israel and Hamas and what is available is far below U.S. standards.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication in Israel. Pharmaceuticals, both those available over the counter and those requiring a prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few restrictions or controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication may only be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1444?language=en_US#:~:text=U.S.%20Citizens%20Traveling%20with%20Medication,and%20import%20for%20personal%20use.) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#:~:text=The%20FDA%20understands%20that%20you,additional%20medication%20sent%20to%20them.) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Israel to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is subject to complex local regulation. For additional information, visit the Israel Ministry of Health [website](https://www.gov.il/en/service/embryo-carrying) for information on surrogacy.

**Water Quality**

* Tap water in Israel is potable. In many areas of the West Bank and most areas of Gaza, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Adventure Travel**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).
