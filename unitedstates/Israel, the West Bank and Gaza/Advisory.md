**Updated to reflect the termination of authorized departure status for family members of U.S. government personnel and some non-emergency personnel.**

In response to security incidents and without advance notice, the U.S. Embassy may further restrict or prohibit U.S. government employees and their family members from traveling to certain areas of Israel, the Old City of Jerusalem, and the West Bank.

**Reconsider Travel To:**

* Israel due to **terrorism**and **civil unrest**
* West Bankdue to **terrorism** and **civil unrest**

**Do Not Travel To:**

* Gaza due to **terrorism** and **armed conflict and within 11.3 km/7 miles of the Gaza Periphery**
* Northern Israel within **4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders** due to continued military presence and activity
* The Egyptian border within **2.4km/1.5 miles**, except for the Taba crossing, which is open

**Country Summary:** Terrorist groups, lone-actor terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. The security environment is complex and can change quickly, and violence can occur in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza without warning. Increased regional tensions can cause airlines to cancel and/or curtail flights into and out of Israel.

Some areas have increased risk. Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/IsraeltheWestBankandGaza.html) for additional information on travel to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.

**Israel – Reconsider Travel (see below for additional information regarding areas near the Lebanese and Syrian borders)**

Reconsider travel due to **terrorism, and civil unrest.**

The security situation in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and armed UAV intrusions and missiles, can take place without warning.

U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:

* Within 11.3 kilometers/seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line; and
* Northern Israel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian border due to continued military presence and activity

Any official travel of U.S. government personnel within these areas requires approval from the Embassy’s security office.

Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.

**Northern Israel (within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel**

The Israeli authorities restrict travel to areas close to the border given the Israeli Defense Forces continued presence and activity.  Do not travel to this area for any reason.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel are currently restricted from personal travel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.  Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel must obtain special authorization to travel close to these borders.

The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens not travel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

**West Bank – Reconsider Travel**

Reconsider Travel due to **terrorism**and **civil unrest**.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel must obtain special authorization travel to the West Bank. U.S. government employees are currently restricted from all personal travel to the West Bank, except:

* U.S. government employees can use Routes 1, 90, and 443 at any time.
* U.S. government employees are permitted personal daylight travel to Jericho and Bethlehem, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. Given continued closures of checkpoints throughout the West Bank, the only permitted and accessible route into Bethlehem for U.S. government employees and their family members is through Checkpoint 300 near Rachel’s Tomb.

Over the past several months, there has been an increase in violence, Israeli military operations, and terrorist attacks. Some incidents have resulted in injury or death of U.S. citizens. During periods of unrest, the Israeli government may restrict access to and within the West Bank, and some areas may be placed under curfew.

Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees working in Israel with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.

**Gaza – Do Not Travel**

Do not travel for any reason due to **terrorism** and**armed conflict.**

The U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there. The security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. The pedestrian crossing between Gaza and Israel (Erez Crossing) was damaged on October 7, 2023, and remains closed. The pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza (Rafah Crossing) has been closed since May 7, 2024, and remains closed to the general public.

If a U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at [JerusalemACS@state.gov](mailto:JerusalemACS@state.gov).

Visit our website for [Travel to High Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html).

If you decide to travel to Gaza:

* Be prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.  This includes having food, supplies, and medicine for an extended or indefinite period.
* Have a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* If you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment without access to power.
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
* Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
