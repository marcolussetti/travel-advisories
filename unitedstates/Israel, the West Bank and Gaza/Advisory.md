**Updated to reflect the current security situation in Israel and the West Bank.**

* Gaza due to **terrorism** and **armed conflict**
* Northern Israel within 4 kilometers/2.4 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders due to Israel’s continued military presence and activity

**Reconsider Travel To:**

**Country Summary:**  Terrorist groups, lone-actor terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. The security environment is complex and can change quickly, and violence can occur in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza without warning. Increased regional tensions can cause airlines to cancel and/or curtail flights into and out of Israel.

**Gaza – Do Not Travel**

Do not travel due to **terrorism** and**armed conflict.**

The U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continue to conduct military operations in Gaza against Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, which was responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel. As a result of the armed conflict, the security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. The pedestrian crossing (Erez Crossing) between Gaza and Israel was damaged on October 7 and remains closed, and the pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been closed since May 7 and it is unknown when it will re-open.  There are sporadic telecommunication and internet outages within Gaza further inhibiting the ability of residents to obtain information.

If a U.S. citizen, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), or qualified immediate family member desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at [JerusalemACS@state.gov](mailto:JerusalemACS@state.gov)with a copy of the individual’s travel document as well as an explanation or proof of relationship.

Visit our website for [Travel to High Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html).

If you decide to travel to Gaza:

* Be prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.
* Have a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* Households with infants and young children should plan for food and supplies, such as diapers and wipes, formula or baby food, and a change of clothing.
* If you take medication, make sure to have at least five days’ worth at any given time – if you can, we encourage enough for two weeks beyond your scheduled trip and have a copy of your prescriptions handy.
* If you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment during a power outage.
* Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
* Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
* Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.

Please be sure to visit our website for [How to Prepare for a Crisis](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html) for information that may be helpful.

**Israel – Reconsider Travel (see below for specific advice on travel within 4 kilometers/2.4 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders)**

Reconsider travel due to **terrorism** and **civil unrest**.

The security situation remains unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and armed UAV intrusions, often take place without warning.

U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:

* Within 11.3 kilometers/seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line; and
* Within 2.4 kilometers/1.5 miles of the Israel-Egypt border.

Any official travel of U.S. government personnel within these areas requires approval from the Embassy’s security office.

Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.

**Northern Israel (within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel**

The Israeli authorities restrict travel to areas close to the border given the Israeli Defense Forces continued presence and activity.

U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel within 4 kilometers/2.25 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Any U.S. government travel to this restricted area requires Regional Security Office approval, and any travel close to the border is done in full coordination with Israeli security forces.

The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens do not travel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

**West Bank – Reconsider Travel**

Reconsider travel due to **terrorism**and **civil unrest**.

U.S. government travel throughout the West Bank is limited. U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from all personal travel to the West Bank, except:

* U.S. government employees can use Routes 1, 90, and 443 at any time.
* U.S. government employees are permitted personal daylight travel to Jericho and Bethlehem, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.  Given continued closures of checkpoints throughout the West Bank, the only permitted and accessible route into Bethlehem for U.S. government employees and their family members is through Checkpoint 300 near Rachel’s Tomb.

Over the past several months, there has been an increase in settler violence, Israeli military operations, and terrorist attacks. Some incidents have resulted in injury or death of U.S. citizens.

Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.
