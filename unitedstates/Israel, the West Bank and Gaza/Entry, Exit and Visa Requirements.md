# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The Government of Israel administers immigration and security controls at its international land crossings with Jordan (into both the West Bank and Israel), Egypt (at the Taba crossing near Eilat), and at Israel’s airports and seaports. A separate network of security checkpoints and crossings operated by Israeli authorities regulates the movement of people and goods between Israel and the West Bank, and between Israel and Gaza.

**The U.S. government seeks equal treatment and freedom of travel for all U.S. citizens regardless of national origin, religion, or ethnicity**. All persons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly including prolonged questioning and physical searches, and may be denied entry or exit consistent with the uniform application of Israeli law. Persons who are denied entry have the right to an immigration court hearing to contest the denial, but they will be detained for the duration of the proceedings. Specific questions about your individual circumstances should be directed to your closest Israeli Embassy or Consulate.

When traveling into Israel, please make sure you have proper travel documentation before arrival in Israel.

* U.S. citizens can use the U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and Branch Office Tel Aviv [online reporting form](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2Fpages%2Fresponsepage.aspx%3Fid%3DdFDPZv5a0UimkaErISH0S3k54wgSN71Bs_xpxUGsY7dURUhMNlc5SlFHS0ZMRVIyTzBYNFpRQVoyWC4u&data=05%7C01%7CSposatoMG%40state.gov%7C1a5f84f855374152860608db9837eb2d%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638271138156629693%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=8HxjshuYHar66%2FAzCD0pBYlC1nhmCeU5hK3zGd60h7Q%3D&reserved=0).
* U.S. citizens can call the Embassy at the phone numbers on our website (denials of entry only): [U.S. Citizen Services - U.S. Embassy in Israel (usembassy.gov)](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fil.usembassy.gov%2Fu-s-citizen-services%2F&data=05%7C01%7CSposatoMG%40state.gov%7C1a5f84f855374152860608db9837eb2d%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638271138156629693%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=48MY%2FRsbOVp%2Fv52z6FfHKgPC5tPCT2gd3GVBT79%2BqeQ%3D&reserved=0)

Please note that the decision to admit or deny a traveler admission to Israel is entirely made by the State of Israel. The U.S. Embassy does not control this process and cannot intervene on an individual’s behalf. However, U.S. citizens who are denied entry into Israel or the West Bank should receive a written explanation from Israeli authorities.

Israeli authorities consider participation in the following activities when deciding whether to refuse entry to individuals into Israel and the West Bank:

* Publicly called for the boycott of Israel;
* Publicly (orally or in writing) denied the Holocaust or the October 7, 2023, massacre; or
* Publicly (orally or in writing) supported the prosecution of Israeli citizens in a foreign country or in an international court for actions committed while they served in the IDF or in other Israeli security services.

In addition to contacting the U.S. Embassy, if you were the subject of mistreatment or harassment by Israeli authorities upon entry to or exit from Israel, you may also email [TZ@piba.gov.il](mailto:TZ@piba.gov.il) to file a complaint with the Israeli authorities. If the mistreatment or harassment occurred at a check point to the West Bank you may email [inquiries@cogat.gov.il](mailto:inquiries@cogat.gov.il) to file a complaint.

7. What if I’m an Israeli citizen?

Individuals with Israeli citizenship, regardless of other nationality, including U.S. citizenship, must enter and depart Israel using their Israeli passports in accordance with Israeli law. Due to a passport backlog, Israeli citizens are temporarily allowed to enter and depart Israel on non-Israeli passports until December 31, 2025. U.S.-Israeli citizens do not need to submit an [Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/IsraeltheWestBankandGaza.html#ExternalPopup) application and should depart the United States on their U.S. passport and enter Israel on their Israeli passport as long as they have checked in to their flight with the Israeli passport.

Israeli citizens are prohibited from using the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge crossing. They are also prohibited from entering Gaza and are generally prohibited from traveling to parts of the West Bank under PA control (Area A), to include Bethlehem and Jericho.
