Exercise increased caution in Algeria due to **terrorism**and**kidnapping**.

**Do not travel to:**

* Areas near the eastern and southern borders due to **terrorism and kidnapping**.

**Country Summary:** Terrorists continue plotting possible attacks in Algeria. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning and have recently targeted the Algerian security forces. Most attacks take place in rural areas, but attacks are possible in urban areas despite a heavy and active police presence.

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside Algiers province due to Algerian government restrictions on travel by U.S. government employees.
