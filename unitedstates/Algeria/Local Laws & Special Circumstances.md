# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, you may be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. This includes for laws you may not be aware of. Get information from the local authorities before you start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses.

* Always carry your passport, or a copy of it, with you, or you may be taken in for questioning by law enforcement officials.
* Photographing military installations and government buildings (often marked by an Algerian flag over the entrance) is prohibited.
* Items that are legal to bring into and carry in the United States may not be legal in Algeria.
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) website and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**

Algerian law criminalizes so-called acts against nature. It also criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual acts between adult men and women. The law includes imprisonment of six months to three years and a fine of DZD 1,000 to DZD 10,000 ($8 to $80). The law also includes imprisonment of two months to two years and fines of DZD 500 to DZD 2,000 ($4 to $16) for committing a “homosexual act.” If a minor is involved, the adult may face up to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of DZD 10,000 ($80).

LGB activists reported sweeping accusations that resulted in multiple arrests for consensual same-sex sexual relations. The arrests were permitted under the vague wording of laws criminalizing “homosexual acts” and so-called acts against nature. However, there were no known prosecutions during the past year. LGB status is not criminalized. However, LGB persons may face prosecution under laws disproportionately applied against LGB individuals. These typically concern prostitution, public indecency, and “associating with bad characters”. NGOs report that judges give harsher sentences to LGB persons compared to non-LGB persons.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Algeria prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public, however, is not as common as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation and lodging. It is also limited in communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference between large cities and the rest of the country.

Availability of rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices is severely limited. Service providers, like sign language interpreters or personal assistants, are also severely limited.

**Students:**See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Women Travelers:**Women walking along the streets in Algeria may experience sexual harassment from passing motorists and pedestrians. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).

**Travel within Algeria:**Non-Algerian employees of foreign companies or organizations based in Algeria must contact the Ministry of the Interior, Foreigners Office, before engaging in travel within the interior of the country. The Ministry will notify local police of the planned travel. The police may choose to assign escorts for that travel.

**Marriage in Algeria:**See our [Marriage in Algeria page](https://dz.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/marriage-in-algeria/) for documents that must be obtained before leaving the United States.

**Disaster Preparedness:**Algeria is a seismically active country. Earthquakes regularly occur throughout the country. Make contingency plans for your travel in Algeria. Leave emergency contact information with family members outside of Algeria. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/disaster)and at [Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/).

**Currency:**Algeria is a cash society. Most credit cards are not accepted outside of hotels. You must declare upon entry at Customs if you are traveling with more than 3000 Algerian dinar. You must also declare foreign currency that exceeds 1000 Euros (or the equivalent, approx. 1,100 USD). You can take up to 7500 Euros (or equivalent in other foreign currency, approx. 8,300 USD) out of the country. Proof that you withdrew the money from an Algerian bank account is required. Non-residents cannot take any amount of Algerian currency outside of the country. Algerian residents can take up 10,000 DA out of the country. Algerian dual-nationals who are not residents cannot exit with Algerian currency.

The official exchange rate may vary considerably from the actual exchange rate on the street. It is illegal to change money on the black market. You should only exchange foreign currency at banks or authorized currency exchange locations, such as major hotels.

Upon leaving Algeria, authorities may ask if you have any currency and possibly search you. Penalties can be severe if you failed to declare foreign currency above the allowed amount upon entering Algeria but are found to possess it when exiting the country. They will compare the amount of foreign currency you declared when entering and the amount you are taking out. You will need to show documentation that your currency was exchanged legally.
