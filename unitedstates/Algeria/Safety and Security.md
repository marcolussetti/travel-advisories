# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists use simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds.  They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Terrorist Activity:** Algeria has long been an important counterterrorism partner to the United States. It continues its aggressive campaign to eliminate all terrorist activity. However, active terrorist threats remain in Algeria and along its borders. In 2024, the Algeria reported nearly 53 counter-terrorism operations. These resulted in nine terrorists captured and 10 hideouts discovered and destroyed. Over the past five years, Algeria reported 24 major attacks. Almost all these terrorist attacks targeted Algerian security forces. Almost all involved improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or ambush tactics as suspects actively fled through rural mountainous regions.

We warn U.S. citizens against travel to remote areas in southern and eastern Algeria. This is due to a high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. As noted in our [Travel Advisories for Algeria](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/algeria-travel-advisory.html), U.S. citizens should:

* Avoid travel to rural areas within 50 km (31 miles) of the border with Tunisia and within 250 km (155 miles) of the borders with Libya, Niger, Mali, and Mauritania due to terrorist and criminal activities.
* Avoid overland travel across the Sahara. Travel to Saharan cities only by air.
* Remain on principal highways when traveling to coastal/mountainous areas east of Algiers and the mountains immediately south of Algiers.
* Always travel with reputable Algerian travel agents who know the area.
* Avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations.
* Inform local police when staying in locations outside of major cities.

Active terrorist groups in Algeria include Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Individuals who are inspired by and loyal to Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) are also active. These groups typically target Algerian government interests and security forces outside of major cities and mainly in mountainous and remote areas, but still aspire to target Western interests. Successful Algerian counterterrorism operations have limited AQIM, AQIM-allied groups, and ISIS capabilities.

Recent incidents include:

* 2023 - Algerian soldier was killed in the Tissemssilt province flighting a terrorist group. The operation resulted in four terrorists arrested.
* 2020 and 2022 – Attacks targeting law enforcement facilities were prevented but killed and injured security forces. This occurred in the border regions of the southern wilayas of Bordj Badji Mokhtar and In Guezzam.
* June 2020 – AQIM claimed responsibility for the ambush of an army patrol in Ain Defla that killed one soldier. They also claimed an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in Medea that killed two soldiers.
* February 2020 – ISIS-Algeria claimed responsibility for an attack on an army outpost in Bordj Badji Mokhtar, near the border with Mali. The attack was done with a suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED). It killed one Algerian soldier.

**Crime:**Algeria’s crime rate is moderate. Algeria has a very visible police presence throughout the country. Many plain-clothes police officers also exist. Petty theft and home burglary occur frequently in low-income areas. They also occur occasionally in affluent areas. Theft of contents and parts from parked cars, on trains and buses, and in hotel rooms occurs. Pickpocketing and purse snatching also occurs. In general, women face harassment in public if not accompanied by a male. Foreign women attract greater unwanted attention in public. International hotels generally provide adequate security.

We have seen several cases in which U.S. citizen women meet an Algerian man online. They are then lured to Algeria for marriage and held against their will in abusive situations.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Algeria.html#ExternalPopup) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Algeria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.

Tips to avoid scammers:

* Look for red flags like their location is far away, their profile was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or they ask for money.
* Set up a phone call/video chat in the initial stages.
* Do a reverse image search on the profile picture.
* If they ask for help, you should refer to them to the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate so we can work with local authorities to assist.
* If you believe you have been scammed, report the incident to local law enforcement right away and stop all communications with the scammer.

Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:**Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are. Meet in a popular public place. Avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at (213) 770-08-2000. The crime emergency lines in Algeria are 1548 and 17; for gendarmes, call 1055.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
