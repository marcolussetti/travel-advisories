# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Algeria](https://embwashington.mfa.gov.dz/services-for-foreigners/entry-visa-to-algeria-1) website for the most current visa information.

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport valid for at least six months
* Visa

Passengers arriving via a cruise ship and who will be part of an organized shore excursion do not require a visa in advance. Passengers wishing to visit certain cities of the south may qualify for a visa on arrival if this is organized by an approved travel agency.  All other travelers must obtain a visa from an Algerian embassy or consulate in advance of travel. If you have Israeli entry stamps in your passport, you may experience difficulties.

**Dual Nationality:** The Algerian government treats dual-national Algerian-Americans who enter Algeria on an Algerian passport solely as Algerian citizens. U.S. citizen women married to Algerians do not require the husband’s authorization to depart. Dual-national minor children exiting Algeria on an Algerian passport with just one parent will need to provide the Algerian family book (livret de famille) in order to demonstrate the relationship between the child and the accompanying parent.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Algeria.
