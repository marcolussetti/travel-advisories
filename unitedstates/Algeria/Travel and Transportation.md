# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Algeria suffers significant road safety problems, including poorly maintained roads, a lack of roadway signage, insufficient vehicle maintenance, defective and pirated auto parts, driver fatigue, and reckless and unskilled drivers. Lack of enforcement continues to be a major problem. While emergency response resources are adequate in Algiers and other populated cities, this is not the case in rural areas.

* Travel overland, particularly in the southern regions, may require a permit issued by the Algerian Ministry of Interior.
* Algeria recognizes International Driving Permits. U.S. citizens who wish to drive in Algeria should obtain an International Driver’s Permit in advance. See the Department’s [Driving Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html)page for more information on driving permits. For information on obtaining an Algerian driver’s license, see the [Algerian Ministry of Interior’s page for driving licenses](https://www.interieur.gov.dz/index.php/ar/).
* Drivers will encounter police and military checkpoints on major roads within/around Algiers and other major cities. Police will require you to turn off your headlights when approaching a checkpoint at night.
* Rather than traffic lights, police control most major traffic intersections in Algiers.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving in Algeria can be chaotic and unsafe.  There are limited traffic signs, very few designated lanes, and drivers often straddle two lanes when there are designated lanes.  There are very few sidewalks and pedestrians must often walk in the street.  When driving, ensure that you carry your state license and International Driver License.  In case of a traffic accident, contact the police and do not move vehicles until a police officer arrives.  Ensure that you get the other driver’s insurance information and identification as well.

**Public Transportation:** Trains operate between cities in the coastal regions of Algeria (although not inter-country). They are generally safe and reliable. There is a new urban railway in Algiers that runs along the coast and is clean and well-policed. Due to concerns about crime and mechanical safety, citizens should carefully consider the risks of buses, as well as taxis hailed on the street. There are new radio-dispatch taxis within Algiers as well as taxi hailing apps such as “Yassir” and “Heetch”.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Algeria, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Algeria’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Algeria should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts).  Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
