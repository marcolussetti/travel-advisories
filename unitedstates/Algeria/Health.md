For emergency services in Algeria, dial 021711414.

Ambulance services are available in major cities such as the capital city of Algiers, but training and availability of emergency responders varies and may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are also not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.  Response times are unpredictable and not as rapid as in the U.S. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

We highly recommend you review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Algeria.

* Select your destination in the [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center).
* Review all sub-sections. These include the Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* Review the [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) webpage that provide advice on medical considerations including:
* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Credit card payment is not usually available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment at time of services rendered

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst in the summer. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://dz.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/doctors/).  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Algeria.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health facilities:** Adequate health facilities are available in Algiers and other major cities, but quality is variable. Health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Medical staff may speak little or no English.

Generally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.

Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care primarily available through government institutions

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Algerian Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Algeria.
* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Algeria to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Algeria.

**Water Quality:**Tap water is often not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that many places serve tap water unless bottled water is requested. Ice for drinks may be made with tap water.
