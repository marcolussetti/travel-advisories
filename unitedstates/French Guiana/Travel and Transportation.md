**Road Conditions and Safety:** Primary roads are paved and well maintained. Roads in rural areas are less developed.

* Avoid driving at night due to unlit roads and vehicles, as well as stray livestock, especially in the remote interior regions or on less-developed rural roads.
* There are few to no service stations on the roads between cities and towns.
* It is advisable to carry spare tires, extra fuel, tools, etc.

**Traffic Laws:** You need a valid driver’s license and an International Driving Permit in order to drive in French Guiana. Follow generally accepted driving rules regarding seatbelts and mobile phone use. Be aware that traffic policing may be limited outside major cities, so be vigilant for other drivers’ behavior. French Guiana has strict laws regarding driving under the influence and authorities consider 0.05% blood alcohol concentration to be the limit.

Drivers are expected to have an accident form in the car, to fill out in case of accident. It is advisable to get witnesses, if possible. If there are injuries, the police need to be called. It is not common to be asked for a bribe.

Aggressive drivers are common. Motorcycles and mopeds weave in and out of traffic lanes. In slow traffic, motorcycles often pass cars.

**Public Transportation:** Taxis and vans are relatively safe.
