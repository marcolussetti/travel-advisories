The Government of French Guiana requires all non-citizens age 12 and over entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

For emergency services in French Guiana, dial 112. You may also reach services directly at:

- EMS: 15

- Police: 17

- Fire department: 18

- Child abuse: 119

- Homelessness assistance: 115

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable.

* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Medical care within French Guiana is limited. Hospital facilities are available only in urban areas.

* Only one hospital, the Centre Hospitalier Andrée Rosemon in Cayenne, has intensive care and trauma units. The Centre Hospitalier de l’Ouest Guyanais in St. Laurent provides more limited hospital services in the western part of French Guiana.
* Not all medical facilities in French Guiana are air conditioned.
* You can find prescription and over-the-counter medicines in pharmacies in larger cities, but U.S. brands may not be available.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check the [French Customs website](https://www.douane.gouv.fr/fiche/private-individuals-carrying-medicinal-products-france) to ensure the medication is legal in French Guiana.

**Vaccinations**

Proof of vaccination for yellow fever, or written proof from a doctor that yellow fever vaccination is not medically recommended, is required to enter French Guiana. Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
