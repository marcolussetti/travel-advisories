# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Political rallies and social protests may occur spontaneously in Gabon, particularly in Libreville and Port Gentil. Even gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational or violent. Be aware of your surroundings and personal security at all times. Avoid large gatherings, protests, demonstrations, and any other event where crowds congregate. Police and security forces typically disperse crowds using tear gas or other force.

**Crime:** Muggings, pick-pocketing, and theft of unattended possessions are the most common forms of crime visitors encounter. There have been reports of violent crime, including armed robbery. Vehicle break-ins and residential burglaries continue to be a problem in Libreville and Port Gentil.

Carry identification at all times to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints.

Avoid poorly lit streets and unfamiliar areas of the city, especially at night. Avoid beaches after dusk. Carry a minimal amount of cash and avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, especially in markets and nightlife spots. In a robbery, comply with the attacker to avoid injury.

In the event of a fire, dial 18 in Libreville. In Port Gentil, please dial 07-63-93-63 or 01-56-27-75.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are inconsistent. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be certified by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
