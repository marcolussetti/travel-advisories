# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**All drivers and passengers should wear seat belts, lock doors, and keep windows closed. Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints within cities and on roads to the interior. During routine stops, the police may occasionally seek bribes.

Use extreme caution when driving after dark.  Roads to outlying cities are usually unpaved and in poor condition, with large potholes, absence of road signs, poor to non-existent streetlights, timber-laden trucks, and the presence of pedestrians and animals. Construction work is generally poorly indicated. Drivers may change lanes or stop unexpectedly and lane markings are frequently ignored. Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended for travel beyond the paved road to Lambaréné, especially during the rainy season.

Roadside assistance and emergency medical services are available in Libreville, but they may not be dependable. These services are nonexistent outside of the city. Service stations are available along main roads, but vehicle repair facilities are not always available.

**Traffic Laws and Culture:** During short-term tourist or business visits, U.S. citizens may drive a vehicle in Gabon provided they have both a valid U.S. and an international driver’s license. Those residing or working in Gabon (holders of a carte de séjour) must either obtain a Gabonese driver’s license (permis de conduire), or register their U.S. driver’s license with the Direction National de Transport Terrestre.

The following items must be kept in the vehicle at all times: the vehicle registration (carte grise), proof of insurance (assurance), proof of vehicle inspection (visite technique), fire extinguisher (extincteur de feu), triangles (triangles), and first aid kit (boite de soins de premiers secours). The police may verify that the driver has all of the required documentation and equipment if they stop a car on the road or at a police checkpoint.

It is against the law to use a cell phone while driving in Gabon.

When driving a vehicle or as a passenger in a taxi, you should:

* Keep your belongings out of sight
* Ensure the doors are locked
* Fasten your seat belts
* Keep the windows rolled up

If you are driving, while stopped in traffic, scan rearview mirrors to identify potential trouble. If you are idling at a stop light or sign, leave adequate maneuver room between vehicles to allow for a hasty departure if necessary.  Even in daylight, thieves may open unlocked vehicle doors to snatch valuables. Park only in well-lit areas, preferably in parking lots with a security guard.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid public transportation throughout Libreville due to the substantial risk of serious and fatal accidents. Many lack proper safety equipment such as seat belts and headlights and are often overcrowded and unlicensed. Drivers are often reckless, making frequent stops to pick up passengers, drive at high speeds, and ignore traffic or road conditions.

Taxi safety and maintenance varies widely. Informal, unregulated taxis are common throughout the city.  Select taxis in good condition and verify that there are passenger seatbelts and avoid those in poor condition. Most major hotels will call an official taxi upon request. Unless using a metered taxi, negotiate the fare and request sole use of the taxi with the driver before entering the taxi.

An inter-city rail system exists, running from Libreville to Franceville with stops at numerous small cities and towns along the way. 

Please refer to our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information and seek information from Gabonese authorities responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Gabon, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Gabon’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Gabon should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s [Maritime Security Communications with Industry WebPortal](http://www.marad.dot.gov/msci).
