# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.**

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Immigration Violations:** U.S. citizens working or residing in Gabon must comply with Gabonese immigration laws. Non-compliance with such laws may be punished with fines and up to six months’ imprisonment. You should consult a Gabonese lawyer to assure compliance with immigration and residence laws.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Language:** The official language of Gabon is French. English is not widely spoken or understood.

**Identification:** You should always carry identification and proof of legal immigration status in Gabon. Examples of identification include a residence permit (carte de séjour), U.S. passport, or an authenticated photocopy of your U.S. passport’s biographic information page, and your Gabonese visa. City hall offices in Gabon can authenticate passport photocopies for a nominal fee.

**Photography:** Taking photographs of the Presidential Palace, airport, and military or other government buildings is strictly forbidden.

**Official Corruption:** Official corruption is common, but paying bribes is strongly discouraged and may make you a target for further attempts at securing bribery payments.

**Currency:** Gabon is largely a cash economy. Credit cards are accepted at only a few major hotels. Due to the high rate of credit card fraud, you should exercise caution when using them. Traveler’s checks can be cashed or dollars exchanged for Central African Francs (CFA) at hotels and banks. ATMs are available in major urban centers and dispense CFA. Exercise caution while withdrawing funds from ATMs.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Gabon. Although there have been no reports of violence against LGB persons, discrimination, including in housing and employment, is a problem. Many LGB individuals choose to keep their status secret, except in trusted circles. Stigma is a likely factor in preventing the reporting of incidents.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and Section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Persons with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different in Gabon from what they find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with “physical, mental, congenital, and accidental” disabilities and requires access to buildings or services for persons which such disabilities. Most public buildings do not provide adequate access. There is some societal discrimination against persons with disabilities and treatment facilities are limited.
