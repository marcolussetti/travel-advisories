# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

A passport with more than six months of validity remaining, a visa, and proof of vaccination against yellow fever are required for entry into Gabon. For additional immunization information, visit the CDC’s [Health Information for Travelers to Gabon](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/gabon).

The most reliable means of securing a visa for travel to Gabon is to apply prior to departure at the [Embassy of the Gabonese Republic](https://www.gabonembassyusa.org/) in Washington D.C. or the [Consulate of the Gabonese Republic](http://gabonconsulate-nyc.com/en/visas/) in New York. Please check their websites for visa requirements.

Immigration officials may require travelers to provide proof of a flight itinerary with a departure from Gabon, the name, number, and address of a contact in Gabon or  an invitation letter from a person or entity in Gabon,  and a confirmed hotel reservation. There have been some reports of airlines refusing to issue a boarding pass for travel to Gabon when a traveler is unable to present a Gabonese visa prior to departure.

Short-term visitors to Gabon are permitted to stay up to 90 days. Visitors who wish to remain in the country for longer than 90 days must obtain a residence permit (carte de séjour). Exit visas for U.S. residents with a carte de séjour are no longer required.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Gabon.

Gabon may deny entry to people coming from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) affected countries.
