# Safety and Security

**Demonstrations** occur frequently in Buenos Aires and take place in other cities as well. Protesters often block streets and highways. Demonstrations are usually nonviolent, but always have the potential to turn confrontational.  Avoid demonstrations if possible.

**Crime:**  Street crime is a problem in most urban areas including Buenos Aires City, Buenos Aires province, Rosario, and Mendoza. Look out for muggers, pickpockets, scam artists, cellphone and purse-snatchers who work on the street, in restaurants and hotel lobbies, at bus and train stations, in public transportation, and in cruise ship ports.

* In Buenos Aires City, the (San Telmo, La Boca, Retiro, and Florida Street areas experience higher crime rates.) Areas outside of the city with higher levels of violent crime include Rosario, and the Buenos Aires suburbs of Lomas de Zamora, Quilmes, and Moreno.
* Although the La Boca neighborhood is a well-known tourist destination, there have been violent robberies in the daytime as well as nighttime. Stay on the main streets in the tourist zone and use radio taxis to and from the neighborhood.
* Avoid “villas” or shanty towns in Buenos Aires, other major cities, and provinces, even if they are in tourist zones.
* Frequent robberies of luggage and handbags occur at Retiro bus station in Buenos Aires,  the bus station in Mendoza, and when leaving a handbag in the overhead compartment on the bus.

**Robberies:**Robberies involving motorcycles (called “motochorros”) occur frequently in cities. These thieves normally operate in pairs:  one operates the bike, an the other jumps off and takes the watches, purses, and backpacks of pedestrians. The motochorros also reach, or break, into cars to snatch valuable items.

Robberies involving drugs that incapacitate victims are becoming more common in Argentina. Thieves use dating apps to schedule “dates,” at a hotel room or private residence and then drug and rob the victim. Individuals have also been drugged at bars when socializing with strangers.  Criminals identify potential drugging victims in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Consider meeting in a public area and always be cautious of accepting drinks from people or allowing others to have access to your drink.

Be cautious when using ATMs. While withdrawing funds, victims are forced to take out as much money as possible and sometimes at different locations, maxing out their cards at each location.

Foreigners in Argentina have been the victims of kidnapping for ransom schemes. The victim is typically held for ransom and family members or co-workers are contacted to bring all the cash they have on hand or can gather in a couple of hours.  Once the ransom is paid, the victim is usually released unharmed. Fake telephone kidnappings are also common.

The U.S. Embassy receives many reports of stolen passports.  Passports and other valuables should be locked in a hotel safe.  Carry a photocopy of your passport with you.  In addition, U.S. citizen residents and visitors should safeguard personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, banking and other information, to protect against identity theft

Robberies occur often, and violence is more likely to occur when victims resist. Do not leave your personal belongings unattended  
  
**Taxi Scams:**Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate “remise” services (private car with driver) from the airport service counters. In town, use radio taxis from places like a hotel when possible.  See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the FBI [Financial Crime I](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Argentina.html#ExternalPopup) pages for information on scams.  A few common scenarios follow:

* Drivers pretend to help tourists with money while trading good bills for counterfeit ones.
* A “handler” at the airport accepts payment for the ride, but then the driver also demands money at the end of the ride.
* The taxi “breaks down” on the road, and a second taxi comes to get the passenger.  Both drivers demand payment.
* Spraying mustard or another substance on the tourist from a distance.  An accomplice robs the victim while pretending to help clean the stain.
* Protestors (‘piqueteros’) sometimes block major roads during large protests and can cause significant traffic delays.

**General Precautions:**

* Do not place handbags on the back of your chair or on the floor at a restaurant.  Keep them in your lap.
* Do not leave your drink unattended.
* Do not leave cellphones on tables at restaurants.
* Avoid openly displaying your cell phone
* Travelers should not pack valuables in checked bags.
* Avoid using ATMs in unfamiliar, secluded, or lightly protected areas.

**Climbing, Hiking, and Trekking: Do not trek alone.**The U.S. Embassy in Argentina **strongly** **discourages** U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, U.S. citizens and other foreigners have disappeared or been seriously injured while solo climbing/hiking and trekking. Sexual assaults have been reported against solo hikers and bikers on trails in regions along the border with Chile.  Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings. Follow Park Ranger and Search and Rescue Team advice and instructions.

Update your SOS or GPS emergency locator information. Make sure your device is enabled to function in the park and your provider has the correct information for authorities. Add local rescue teams as your first emergency contact *(see recourses below)* and add the U.S. Embassy’s emergency contact phone number as an alternative: +54-11 5777-4354.

Before your trip check the following resources for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards in the most popular climbing, hiking and trekking regions in Argentina:
