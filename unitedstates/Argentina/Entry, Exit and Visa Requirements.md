# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Entry/Exit Requirements for U.S. Citizens:**    
U.S. citizens need a valid passport to enter Argentina. U.S. citizens with expired or damaged passports may not be allowed to enter and could be sent back to the United States at their own expense. Private U.S. citizens do not need a visa for visits of up to 90 days for tourism or business. Diplomatic or official passport holders must obtain visas prior to arrival.   
  
Visit the Embassy of Argentina’s website for visa information at [https://eeeuu.cancilleria.gob.ar/en](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Argentina.html#ExternalPopup).

The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires cannot help travelers with obtaining visas for other countries. U.S. citizens embarking on a cruise ship from Argentina that includes other countries, should verify if they need visas for those countries before boarding the ship. For more information, see the country specific information for the country you plan to visit.

For information about customs rules, please read our Customs Information page and the Argentine Customs page.

**Special Entry/Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals:**    
Different rules may apply to dual U.S.-Argentine citizens, depending on when they became U.S. citizens. Visit the Argentine [Immigration website](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/interior/migraciones/entrada-y-salida-del-pais) for the most current information. Generally, Argentine citizens are required to depart Argentina using an Argentine passport, including children of U.S. citizens who may be born in Argentina.

**Special Entry/Exit Requirements for Minors:**  
A parent or guardian traveling alone with a child under 18 who resides in Argentina must present to Argentine authorities a legalized permission letter in Spanish (*Autorización de Viaje*) from the non-accompanying parent upon departure from Argentina. Either parent may prepare an authorizing letter for the other parent to travel abroad with the child in case of emergency. (Please see the [Argentine immigration website](https://cancilleria.gob.ar/en/visas) for more information). A local notary public (called an *escribano* in Argentina) may prepare the *autorización de viaje* letter. If this notarized authorization is prepared in the United States, Argentine authorities will require an apostille from the United States in addition to the notarized authorization. Please see this link for more information about an apostille: [Apostille Requirements.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/apostille-requirements.html) For children born in the United States and who are residents in Argentina, Argentine authorities will require the U.S. birth certificate to be apostilled and translated into Spanish by a certified translator.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:**   
The U.S. Department of State does not know of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for foreign visitors or residents of Argentina.
