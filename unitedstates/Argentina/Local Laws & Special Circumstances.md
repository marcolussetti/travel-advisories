# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:**

* Dual Nationals: U.S.-Argentine dual nationals may have to follow special rules that apply to Argentine citizens. In some cases, the U.S. government may have trouble providing protection abroad to dual citizens.
* Foreign Credit Card Usage: On November 3, 2022, the Argentine Central Bank issued a regulation allowing credit card issuers to implement an alternate, more favorable exchange rate for tourists utilizing foreign (i.e., non-Argentine) credit cards. This is a legal, safe method to pay for goods and services in Argentina at a more favorable rate. The regulation does not apply to withdrawals of pesos from ATMs. Please contact your credit card issuer to confirm whether they are implementing this program. For more information on this new regulation, you may read the Argentine Central Bank’s announcement at [https://bcra.gob.ar/Pdfs/comytexord/A7630.pdf](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbcra.gob.ar%2FPdfs%2Fcomytexord%2FA7630.pdf&data=05%7C01%7CRiveraLP%40state.gov%7C3454e12260b649a9e2af08db2eeaab7f%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638155357655133572%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=BPHWkcJyQB014YBNXghLLk3Jzw3ISIId%2BDjkKnn7BcQ%3D&reserved=0)
* Currency Exchange and Access:  You must show your passport to exchange money. Keep all receipts related to buying pesos. Exchange money only at banks, hotels, and money exchangers with actual store fronts. The Embassy does not exchange money.
* Some U.S. citizens report problems using their ATM cards issued by U.S. banks at certain ATMs. There is no set list of ATMs or banks where you can use U.S. cards. If your ATM card does not work at one ATM, try another one or use a reputable bank or exchange house. Daily withdrawal limits may also be lower than in the U.S.
* Hunting and Fishing/Transporting Firearms: If you plan to hunt or fish, follow all gun and game laws. Some U.S. citizens report problems bringing guns into and out of Argentina. More information can be found [here](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-abroad-with-firearms.html).
* Adventure Travel: Local resources are limited for helping visitors lost or injured in remote areas. Travelers visiting isolated and wilderness areas mustshould learn about local conditions and give their itinerary to park or police officials.
* Argentina has the highest mountain in the Americas, Mount Aconcagua. Several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have died while climbing the mountain. Rescue missions are often impossible.
* Antarctica Travel: Many cruises to Antarctica depart from the port of Ushuaia, near the southern tip of Argentina.  The greatest threats to travelers to Antarctica are environmental hazards posed by extreme and unpredictable weather and limited emergency services.  Among the more common threats are frostbite, dehydration, eye damage from reflected glare, overexposure to the sun, and maritime accidents.  There have been accidental deaths on Antarctic cruises due to rough sea conditions, including rogue waves.  For additional information on travel to the Antarctic please see the Country Information page for Antarctica: Antarctica International Travel Information (state.gov)
