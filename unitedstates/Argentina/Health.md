**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation is extremely costly.

**Medications:**If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Embassy of Argentina](https://eeeuu.cancilleria.gob.ar/en/content/contact-0) to ensure the medication is legal in Argentina.  Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Health Concerns:**The following diseases are prevalent either throughout Argentina or in certain areas:

* Hepatitis A
* Yellow Fever
* Dengue
* Typhoid
* Rabies

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and [CDC recommendations for travel to Argentina](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/argentina).

**Mosquitos**:

Throughout the Argentine summer months (December-March), mosquitos are prevalent and carry diseases such as Dengue and Equine Encephalitis. Insect repellant can be difficult to purchase during these months as well. We recommend bringing insect repellant (with Deet) in your checked luggage.

**Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Argentina to have a child through the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* On October 22, 2024, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled that the surrogate mother (the woman who carried the child for the intendingparents) cannot be removed from the birth certificate.
* Argentina does not have legislation that regulates surrogacy and all surrogacy arrangements are subject to ongoing developments in Argentine law.  This applies to both the surrogacy arrangements as well as administrative procedures such as issuing of birth certificates and travel arrangements for babies born through surrogacy.
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in Argentina through surrogacy, be prepared for possible delays to document your child’s birth in Argentina and ongoing changes in regulations.
