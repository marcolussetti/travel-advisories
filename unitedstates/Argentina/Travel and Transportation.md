**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving is more dangerous than in the United States. Drivers in Argentina tend to be aggressive, especially in Buenos Aires, and often ignore traffic regulations. Drivers should prepare in advance when taking long road trips and make sure to have adequate insurance coverage. Gas stations are often far apart and not always easily identified from the main roadway. You need an Argentine or international driver’s license to drive but verify with local authorities for the most current information.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) and the website of Argentina's [national tourist office](http://www.turismo.gov.ar/) for more information.

**AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Argentina’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Argentina’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**MARITIME TRAVEL:** Mariners planning travel to Argentina should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/mex.html#ExternalPopup), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/mex.html#ExternalPopup).
