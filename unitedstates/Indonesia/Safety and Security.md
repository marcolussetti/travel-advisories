**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets at:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

According to the Indonesian National Police, there were no terrorist attacks in Indonesia since 2022. However, visitors to Indonesia are cautioned that extremists have in the past targeted high-profile events, political rallies, police stations and places of worship. Visitors to Indonesia are cautioned against conduct that may offend local norms or religious sensibilities.

**Travel Restrictions:** U.S. government personnel travel to Central Papua (Papua Tengah) and Highland Papua (Papua Pegunungan) is restricted to mission-essential travel approved in advance by the Embassy due to potential violence, civil disturbance, and political violence.

There have been cases of kidnapping and murder of foreign nationals and threat of violence between groups and civil unrest continue to underlay these risks to travelers. In February 2023, a New Zealand national was taken hostage by an armed group in Paro, Papua Highlands. After over 500 days in captivity, he was released. However, in 2024 another foreign pilot was killed in Papua, and the threat of further violence and civil unrest remains.

**Crime**:

**Violent Crimes**: In the past year, several American citizens have been victims of violent crimes in Indonesia, especially in Bali. You should remain vigilant, follow advisories, and take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings. Monitor bags and luggage, carry only essential items, safeguard your passport and bank cards, and avoid traveling alone.

Pickpocketing, sexual assault, vehicle theft, snatch-and-grab robberies, and residential break-ins are common. Avoid isolated areas late at night and stay aware of your surroundings, especially vehicles or individuals that might be following you.

**Sexual Violence:**Travelers, especially those traveling alone, may face harassment, verbal abuse, and sexual assault. To reduce risk, avoid traveling alone at night, stay vigilant in less populated areas, and be cautious with strangers or new acquaintances, especially when staying in hostels or other types of communal lodging. Never leave food or drinks unattended or with strangers, and avoid accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may be drugged. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment.

There have been reports of serious illnesses and even deaths from "drink-spiking" and drink poisoning incidents (methanol-contaminated alcoholic drinks), especially in clubs and nightspots in urban and tourist areas. Reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking have been noted in Bali, Lombok, Gili Islands, and Sumatra. Ensure drinks are prepared in your sight, avoid accepting drinks from strangers, and never leave drinks unattended.

If you are a victim of sexual assault, report it immediately to local authorities and the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General.

**Domestic Violence:**U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Domestic violence is illegal in Indonesia; however, these laws are rarely enforced.

**Victims of Crime:**U.S. citizens who are victims of a crime should:

* Seek prompt medical assistance, if needed.
* Contact the U.S. Embassy at +62 21-5083-1000.
* Contact the local police at 112.

**Crime Reporting**: It can be difficult to report crimes and receive attention from police quickly. U.S. citizens often face language barriers when reporting crimes.  
  
To initiate a criminal investigation, the victim must make a full statement to the local police in person. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. U.S. Embassy or Consulate staff may accompany you to make a police report, but cannot serve as translators when making official statements to the police or during police interviews. U.S. citizen victims may choose to be accompanied by a translator for these processes.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.

Demonstrations are common in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other large cities. Avoid demonstrations and mass gatherings, as they can become violent. It is illegal for foreigners to participate in protests, and U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Most demonstrations are peaceful, but they do occasionally turn violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Participating in demonstrations on a tourist visa can lead to deportation.

**Scams:**Internet romance and financial scams happen in Indonesia. Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

**Taxis and Mobile Apps**: Use a reputable taxi company such as Blue Bird or Grab, which can be booked via their apps or hired from major hotels or shopping centers. Before fully entering the taxi, match the photo on the dashboard ID with the driver and make sure there is a working meter. When booking a car via a mobile app, share your journey with a friend using the in-app option, and know the app's security contact information. Be cautious of drivers falsely claiming to be registered with ride-hailing apps.

**Credit Card Fraud** is common in Indonesia, with criminals "skimming" cards to access and drain bank accounts. Use ATMs in secure locations, such as major bank branches, and check machines for tampering. Regularly monitor your account statements.

**Technology Usage Abroad**: Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Tourism:**The tourism and recreational activity industries in Indonesia are unevenly regulated, with infrequent safety inspections. Hazardous areas and activities may lack proper signage, and staff may not be trained or certified.

* **Water Sports:** Diving can be hazardous due to light regulation. Hyperbaric chambers are only available in Bali and Ambon. Several U.S. citizens have died in the past year due to scuba diving, surfing, and drowning incidents at sea.
* **Boating:** Boat and ferry incidents are frequent. Vessels often lack adequate safety vests, so passengers should bring their own.
* **Traffic:** Traffic is hazardous, and U.S. citizens are frequently injured on rented motorbikes. Many injuries are serious and require either prolonged hospitalization or international medical evacuation. Helmets are required by law.

**Mountain Hiking:** Never go hiking or climbing alone. When hiking in mountainous areas, obtain current information on local conditions, travel with a reputable guide (a requirement to hike on many mountains), have overseas medical insurance, and carry a local mobile phone. Dangerous trails may not be clearly labeled as such. Hikers on Puncak Jaya in Papua should have realistic primary and backup plans for climbing down the mountain. Tour operators have abandoned climbers. Taking shortcuts through private property is considered trespassing and is not a safe or legal alternative to a proper plan. If possible, ensure your hiking plans are registered and known to local authorities and/or tourism operators, as this helps identify your presence in these areas in the event of an emergency.

Medical treatment is typically available only in major cities and may be basic by U.S. standards. Payment in advance is almost always required for treatment at hospitals. Serious injuries may require medical evacuation to another country. First responders generally cannot provide urgent medical treatment or access areas outside major cities.

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our [Insurance Coverage Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) webpage for more information.

**Please note:**The U.S. Embassy and Consulates do not pay the medical expenses of private U.S. citizens in Indonesia. It is the traveler’s responsibility to ensure adequate medical insurance coverage or funds for medical expenses.
