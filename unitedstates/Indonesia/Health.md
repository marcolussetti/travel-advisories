**For medical emergency services in Indonesia dial 118 or 119.**

Private ambulance services may also be available regionally:

**Jakarta:**[*Emergency Care Paramedic*](https://er-indonesia.co.id/) *+62 877-7575-6886,* [*info@emergencyresponse.co.id*](mailto:info@emergencyresponse.co.id)

**Ambulance services** are:

* not widely available; training and availability of emergency responders may not meet U.S. standards.
* Ambulances may not be equipped with the latest medical equipment.
* Travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance. Sometimes they can take 45 minutes or longer to arrive.

Sanitation and healthcare conditions in Indonesia are below U.S. standards. Routine medical care is available in major cities, but most expatriates leave the country for anything beyond basic procedures. Physicians and hospitals often require payment or sizable deposits before providing care, even in emergencies.

**English-speaking Medical Personnel:** The quality of English-speaking doctors and hospitals varies, even in large cities, and communication difficulties are common. In remote areas, English-speaking medical personnel may be unavailable.  
  
For a list of English-speaking doctors and hospitals, see our Embassy's [website](https://id.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).

**Psychological and Psychiatric Services:** Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.  Inpatient mental health services are not considered to be at U.S. standards. Other private options may be available in some regions.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Be aware that Indonesian authorities may consider some prescription drugs as illegal narcotics. The Indonesian government does not publish a list of which pharmaceuticals are considered contraband, and these decisions may be arbitrary.

Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Medicine to [prevent malaria](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/prevention/) is recommended for all travelers to some areas of Indonesia, even for short stays. Pregnant women should be aware that Indonesia is a [CDC Zika risk area](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html) and that Zika can be spread by mosquitos as well as sexual contact.

Diarrheal diseases are very common throughout Indonesia and [food and water precautions](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/food-and-water-precautions) are recommended.

Rabies is prevalent in animals and animal contact should be avoided.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/health-care-abroad/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation. This is separate and in addition to health insurance.

**Vaccinations:**Be up to date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Water Quality & Food Safety**Tap water is not potable and should not be consumed. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality:**Air quality in Indonesia’s major cities can range from "unhealthy for sensitive groups" to "unhealthy" and can be a significant problem.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html#ExternalPopup), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Indonesia.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html#ExternalPopup).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html#ExternalPopup).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Indonesia. Consider the impact smog and heavy particulate pollution may have and consult your doctor before traveling, if necessary. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Indonesia.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Indonesia.

**Pharmaceuticals**Marijuana, cannabis, hash, "edibles," and products containing CBD or THC remain illegal in Indonesia, including for medicinal purposes. A medical prescription does not make these substances legal.

U.S. citizens are advised against mailing or shipping any medications to Indonesia, as the authorities closely monitor packages containing pharmaceuticals and may detain or arrest recipients of both prescription and over-the-counter medications.  
  
Even if a medication is legal or prescribed in the United States, it may be considered an illegal narcotic in Indonesia. Therefore, U.S. citizens should only hand-carry prescription medications into the country, ensuring they are in the original packaging with a copy of the prescription. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot assist with the importation or release of medications.

When purchasing medication overseas, exercise caution. Local pharmacies offer products of varying quality, availability, and cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a significant risk, so patronize only reputable pharmacies. Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are often readily available with little control. Counterfeit medications may be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Always consult a medical professional and buy from reputable establishments.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation#:~:text=If%20a%20drug%20is%20approved%20for%20use%20in,for%20you%2C%20or%20during%20trips%20outside%20the%20U.S.) websites for more information.
