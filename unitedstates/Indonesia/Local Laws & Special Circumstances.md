# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

Indonesian prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and provide minimal services, with prisoners often bearing the cost of basic services, including healthcare.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to Indonesian laws. Violating local laws, even unknowingly, can result in expulsion, arrest, or imprisonment. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Police corruption in Indonesia is widespread and well documented. U.S. citizens arrested under suspicion of a crime frequently tell of coercive police practices and predatory defense lawyers charging high fees and engaging in non-transparent practices. Most often this occurs when U.S. citizens are arrested for illegal drug possession, and oftentimes for small amounts.

Criminal cases can take months or years to resolve, with suspects held without charges for up to 60 days or longer. The revised criminal code, effective January 2026, includes penalties for defamation, blasphemy, cohabitation, and sex outside of marriage.  
  
Convictions for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Indonesia can result in heavy fines, long jail sentences, or the death penalty. **Some prescription medications legal in the United States, including those for ADHD, are illegal in Indonesia.** Marijuana, cannabis, hash, "edibles," and products containing CBD or THC are illegal, even with a medical prescription. Possession can lead to arrest, imprisonment, fines, deportation, or the death penalty. According to Indonesia’s criminal code, potential fines and prison sentences for bringing even small amounts of illegal drugs into Indonesia are often far beyond what is typical in the United States criminal justice system.

Some laws are prosecutable in the U.S. regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) website and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website for more information.

**Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and Volcanoes:** There are approximately 4,000 earthquakes per year in Indonesia, more than 10 per day on average. While most earthquakes are mild, some cause significant destruction and can trigger tsunamis.

Tsunami warning systems may not be operable, or reports of tremors and tsunamis may be delayed. Local construction standards are lower than in the United States, and many structures including hotels and malls are prone to damage or collapse in an earthquake. Access to disaster-affected areas is often difficult and assistance from the U.S. Embassy may be limited.

If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes. The [Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning Centre](https://rtsp.bmkg.go.id/publicbull.php) issues tsunami warnings when a potential tsunami with significant impact is imminent or expected.

There are 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia. Eruptions frequently cause travel delays, displace local populations, and disrupt economic activities.

**LGB Travelers:** LGB status or conduct is not illegal in Indonesia, and local authorities may take legal action or tolerate harassment against LGB individuals. Some local governments have laws criminalizing LGB relationships. Same-sex marriages or civil unions recognized elsewhere are not legally recognized in Indonesia. The revised criminal code, effective January 2026, includes penalties for cohabitation and sex outside of marriage, though implementation details are unclear.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report for further details](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/).

**Sharia Law:**  Sharia law is enforced in Aceh province and may exist unofficially or through local legislation in other areas. The law is intended for Muslims and should not apply to non-Muslims or foreign visitors. You should be respectful of local traditions, mindful of social norms, and seek guidance from local police if confronted by Sharia authorities.

**Students:** See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Travelers with Disabilities:**  The law in Indonesia prohibits discrimination against persons with mental and physical disabilities, but the law is seldom enforced. Persons with disabilities face severe difficulties in Indonesia as most public places and transportation facilities do not accommodate disabled people. Expect accessibility to be extremely limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

See our [Travelers with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

**Sexual Violence**: Tourists visiting and residing in Indonesia have reported incidents of sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, and assault. The Embassy continues to receive sporadic reports regarding incidents of harassment and sexual assaults. To reduce the likelihood of being victimized, take precautions such as avoiding travel to unfamiliar areas at night and traveling alone. Additionally, dress modestly when in public. Always carrying a cell phone is recommended. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/Women.html).
