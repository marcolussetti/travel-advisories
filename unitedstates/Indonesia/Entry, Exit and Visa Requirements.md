# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Entry Requirements:** To enter Indonesia, your passport must have at least two blank pages and be valid for at least six months beyond your arrival date. If it does not meet these requirements, you will be denied entry. Avoid traveling with a damaged passport or a passport that has been previously reported lost or stolen, as this has resulted in denials of entry. If you are traveling on an emergency passport, you must obtain a visa before arrival in Indonesia.

**Electronic Visa On Arrival (e-VOA):** You may apply for an e-VOA in advance if you are entering Indonesia in Jakarta at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport or in Bali at Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) International Airport. If you meet the requirements, you can apply for an e-VOA at certain international airports, seaports, or land crossings. You will need a passport with at least 6 months of validity, a departure date with a return or onward flight booking, and must pay a 500,000 rupiah fee (about $35). The e-VOA is valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days (for 500,000 rupiah) at the nearest immigration office one week before it expires. Check the requirements and apply for an e-VOA on the Indonesian Immigration website:

* Permissible Visa On Arrival activities include:
  + Tourism,
  + Government visits,
  + Business meetings,
  + Procurement of goods,
  + Transit

**Visa:** For stays over 30 days or for non-VOA purposes, such as employment or journalism, obtain the appropriate visa from an Indonesian embassy or consulate before arrival.

If you overstay your visa, you face a fine of 1 million rupiah per day, and you may be detained, deported, or banned for future travel to Indonesia for a specified period. U.S. citizens have been detained and/or fined for visa overstays or using the wrong visa class. Non-tourism travelers should refer to the Indonesian Immigration website regarding the correct type of visa to procure for specific purposes. Always carry a copy of your passport to establish your identity and proof of visa.

Visit the Embassy of Indonesia website for the most current visa information.

The Government of Indonesia screens incoming passengers in response to reported outbreaks of pandemic illnesses.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Indonesia.

**Exiting Indonesia:** You must exit Indonesia with the same passport you used to enter. If your passport is replaced, you must obtain a "special pass" (exit permit) from Immigration for your new passport before departing.

**Dual-Nationality:** The Indonesian government does not recognize dual nationality. If you have dual nationality, you may be required to formally renounce your Indonesian citizenship. Review Indonesian nationality laws and consult a local attorney for specific guidance.
