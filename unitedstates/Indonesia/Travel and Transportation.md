# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Traffic in Indonesia is hazardous, congested, and undisciplined. Traffic signals are frequently ignored and often in disrepair. Motor vehicles share the roads with other forms of transportation such as pedicabs and pushcarts. Buses and trucks are often dangerously overloaded and travel at high speeds. Accidents between a car and a motorcycle are viewed as the fault of the driver of the car. Consider these risks before driving your own vehicle, especially if you are unaccustomed to Indonesian road conditions. When an accident results in personal injury, Indonesian law requires both drivers to await the arrival of a police officer to report the accident.

**Public Transportation:**Air, ferry, and road accidents that result in fatalities, injuries, and significant damage are common. While all forms of transportation are regulated in Indonesia, oversight is spotty, maintenance may not be properly performed, and rescue and emergency capacity are limited. Indonesia has experienced several fatal plane crashes and non-fatal runway overruns in recent years. Several ferry accidents and a train collision have resulted in dozens of fatalities and even more injuries because of over-crowding and unsafe conditions.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit [Indonesia's national tourist office](https://indonesia.travel/gb/en/general-information) online for road safety information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Indonesia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program

If you intend to fly on private aircraft through Indonesian airspace, get clearances from Indonesian aviation authorities before you depart. You may be detained or receive heavy fines for inadvertently crossing into Indonesian airspace.

**Maritime Safety and Security:**Inter-island travel by boat or ferry can be dangerous: storms can appear quickly, vessels may be over-crowded and lack basic safety equipment, and safety standards vary. Ferries have sunk, resulting in loss of life. The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency records boat and ferry accidents resulting in injuries and deaths yearly. Boats and ferries used in tourism or general transportation frequently break down, stranding passengers or capsizing; not all boats are equipped with adequate life vests. Make sure you are satisfied with safety equipment and life jackets before travelling.

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners and passengers planning travel to Indonesia should check for U.S. [Maritime Advisories and Alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard Homeport](https://mmcvqr.uscg.mil/missions) website, and the [NGA Navigational Warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings) website.

Private vessels have inadvertently anchored in Indonesian waters, especially near Singapore, and have been detained and paid heavy fines.

**Piracy:**While incidents have dropped in the past ten years, maritime piracy and other related crimes in and around Indonesian waters continue. Recent reports include thefts of valuables or cargo from boats that are in port and out at sea. Before traveling by sea, especially in the Strait of Malacca between Riau Province and Singapore, and in the waters north of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, review the current security situation with local authorities. Be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board, and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.
