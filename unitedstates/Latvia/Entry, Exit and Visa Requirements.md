[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the website [the Embassy of Latvia in Washington](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/usa/) for the most current visa information.

The Government of Latvia does not recognize the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. Embassies and consulates overseas, as a valid travel document for visa-free entry into Latvia. If traveling on this emergency passport, you may be refused boarding and/or entry by immigration officials and/or held at the airport until a return flight is available. Emergency passports are valid for exit and transit to return to your place of residence from Latvia.

* If you plan to stay in Latvia more than 90 days, you must apply for temporary residence.
* A criminal records check from the United States, which can be requested through the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Latvia.html#ExternalPopup), is required for a temporary residence permit. You must also submit proof of identity and a set of ink-rolled fingerprint impressions.
* The U.S. Embassy cannot take your fingerprints, but the Latvian State Criminal Police Department is able to provide this service at Bruninieku iela 72, Riga, tel: 371 6720-8662. For more information, contact [the Latvian Embassy](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/usa/)at 2306 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20008, tel: (202) 328-2840, fax: (202) 328-2860.
* You should carry your passport when travelling to neighboring Baltic countries from Latvia – even on day trips – as random passport checks are possible.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.
