The quality of medical care in Latvia continues to improve but often falls short of Western standards. Latvia has highly trained medical professionals, but hospitals and clinics suffer from a lack of equipment and resources.

* Many doctors speak at least limited English.
* There are few private clinics in major cities that offer services equal to Western European or U.S. standards.
* Western-quality dental care can be obtained in Riga.
* Payment is expected upon admission at private hospitals.

**Prescription Medicines**: Pharmaceuticals sold in Latvia are produced by companies certified in accordance with EU standards but may not be labeled the same as in the United States.

For general emergency services in Latvia, dial 112. For medical emergency services, dial 113.

Ambulance services are available in urban areas but not countrywide. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance in rural areas.

**We do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors in Latvia do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on types of overseas insurance. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Latvian Medicines Register [Medicinal Product Register of Latvia](https://www.zva.gov.lv/zvais/zalu-registrs/en/faq) to ensure the medication is legal in Latvia.

**General Health Information:**

The following diseases are prevalent:

* [Tuberculosis](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/default.htm).
* Tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme-disease are widespread throughout the country.
* Use [CDC recommended insect repellents](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/prevent-mosquito-bites.html) containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 to help diminish bites from ticks and other insects if you intend to visit parks or forested areas.
* Tick-borne encephalitis vaccinations are given as a series of three doses, and are not available in the United States.
* There are no vaccines against Lyme disease.
* Hepatitis A is a significant health concern in Latvia. Hepatitis A vaccine is available in the US and is recommended for those with prolonged stays or travel in rural areas.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
