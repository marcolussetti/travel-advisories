# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned or deported.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Latvia are severe. You can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* You can be jailed immediately for driving under the influence of alcohol.
* Your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

**Special Circumstances:** Latvia is part of the Eurozone and only euros are accepted.

* Bank and currency exchange counters may refuse to accept U.S. currency that is crumpled, torn, discolored, or defaced (even small pen strokes are considered defacing). If such notes are accepted for exchange, an additional processing fee, based on the size of the transaction, may be charged. Cashing personal and Treasury checks issued in the United States may be time-consuming and costly.
* **ATMs are widely available in Riga and in major towns.** For security purposes, it is recommended that visitors use ATMs located inside major hotels or shopping malls.
* **Telephone connections with the United States are reliable;** however, U.S. toll-free numbers cannot be accessed from Latvia.

**Customs:** Latvian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Latvia of items such as firearms, religious materials, antiquities, medications, business equipment, drugs, etc.

Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Contact [the Embassy of Latvia in Washington](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/usa/) or one of the [Latvian consulates](https://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/diplomatic-missions#US) in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Althoughcounterfeit and pirated good are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines and have to give them up if you bring them back from the United States.See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

* [Faith-Based Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/faith-based-travel.html)
* [International Religious Freedom Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/rpt/index.htm) – see country reports

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Latvia.

Credible non-governmental organizations report widespread intolerance and discrimination against LGB persons, as well as underreporting to authorities of attacks and discrimination against LGB individuals.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of the [Department of State's Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance**: While in Latvia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different than in the United States.

* The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and other state services, and the government generally enforces these provisions.
* The law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, most buildings are not yet accessible. Although Latvia has made efforts to improve disabled access, only new and completely renovated hotels, guest houses, hostels, and public buildings provide suitable facilities for seriously disabled travelers. See our [Traveling with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.
* You may find general information on accessibility and accommodations on the website of the [Latvian Tourism Board](https://www.latvia.travel/).
* You will rarely find easy-access public transportation and taxis. Free or reduced fares on public transportation are available only to persons with disabilities who are Latvian residents.
