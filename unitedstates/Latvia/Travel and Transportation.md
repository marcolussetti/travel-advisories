**Road Conditions and Safety:** While in Latvia, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States.

* Latvia’s rate of automobile accidents and fatalities is one of the highest in Europe.
* If you plan to drive in Latvia, you are required to obtain an International Driving Permit. You may get these through the American Automobile Association (AAA) or the American Automobile Touring Alliance for a small fee.
* If you drive without an International Driving Permit, police could confiscate your vehicle.
* If you are resident in Latvia more than six months, you are required to apply for a Latvian driver’s license.
* Pedestrians and cyclists are required to wear small reflectors on clothing in Latvia whenever dark outside.

**Traffic Laws:** Driving while intoxicated is a very serious offense and carries heavy penalties. Latvian authorities use roadblocks and breathalyzer tests as enforcement tools.

* You must use your headlights at all times. Speed limits are usually 50 km/hr (31 mph) in the city and 90 km/hr (55 mph) on highways.
* There are many mobile and fixed speed cameras deployed throughout the country.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation is considered safe, but travelers are encouraged to select well-marked taxis.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Latvia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Latvia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Latvia should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the [Maritime Security Communications with Industry Web Portal](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/mlt.html#ExternalPopup). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/mlt.html#ExternalPopup) and as a broadcast warning on the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website](/content/travel/csi_repository/csi_landing/csi_catalog/mlt.html#ExternalPopup).
