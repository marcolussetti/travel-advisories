[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks. However, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Crime against foreign visitors is generally non-violent in nature; however, violent assaults and robberies have occurred. Harassment of foreigners and same-sex partners has also occurred in Latvia.

* Be aware of your surroundings and take personal security measures to stay safe.
* The most common crimes encountered by foreign tourists are purse snatching, pick pocketing, and mugging, especially during the summer tourism season.
* Thieves have targeted foreign vistiors in Riga’s Old Town (Vecriga), Central Train Station (Dzelzcela stacija), Central Bus Station (Autoosta), and Central Market (Centraltirgus).
* Avoid walking alone or using ATMs after dark.
* There have been cases of visitors partying at bars and nightclubs in Riga who have been drugged and subsequently sexually assaulted.
* Be aware of other common scams in restaurants and tourist pubs. Pay special attention to drink prices, as they may rise to exorbitant levels for tourists. Management may use force to secure payment.
* Internet crime is increasing in Latvia.  Common schemes involve internet auction or job-search sites.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories
