# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime:** Police have limited ability to speak English. Violent crime is rare. Robberies at ATMs increase during the May to September tourist season. Visitors should protect their PINs when using ATMs and track their card activity.

**Demonstrations** occur often and some of them can be anti-American. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. Some are during politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable and have the potential to escalate. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Security alerts about [demonstrations](https://me.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) are posted on the Embassy’s website.

Montenegrins are generally open and hospitable to visitors, yet visitors should remain vigilant to the possibility they might encounter anti-foreign sentiment.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

**Victims of Crime:** Visitors in need of emergency assistance may dial 112 to report a crime or request help. 112 is the common emergency telephone number for Europe and may be dialed from mobile telephones even with a foreign SIM card. Victims of crime may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +382 20 410 500. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. U.S. insurance providers may require a local police report to claim losses from theft or property damage.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html).

The Embassy can:

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Medical personnel may not be trained or certified either by the government or by licensed authorities. In the event of an injury, medical treatment may only be available in/near cities. Outside of cities, urgent medical care may not be available. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

Montenegrin nightclubs are popular with foreign tourists. These establishments are often crowded and do not follow U.S. standards for occupancy control or fire safety.
