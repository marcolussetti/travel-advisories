# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws in Montenegro. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. Carrying weapons in Montenegro is illegal. Your U.S. passport will not keep you from being detained, arrested, or prosecuted.

Crimes committed abroad can also be prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Montenegro.html#ExternalPopup).

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or the investigating judge to notify the U.S. Embassy. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Business Practices:** Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires extra permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities before practicing or operating a business.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in Montenegro. If you possess these goods, they may be confiscated by customs officials and/or you may need to pay fines. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Montenegro.html#ExternalPopup) for more information.

**Dual U.S.-Montenegrin citizens:**

* If you became a U.S. citizen prior to June 3, 2006, Montenegro may recognize your dual citizenship. After June 3, 2006, Montenegro does not recognize dual citizenship with the United States.
* Montenegro still abides by the bilateral consular agreement between Yugoslavia and the United States for other consular services, but not for dual citizenship.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Montenegro. The law prohibits discrimination against individuals because of sexual orientation. However, LGB individuals are subject to widespread societal discrimination, ostracism, and harassment.

Seeour [LGBT Travel Information](/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights Report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Athletic Contract Disputes:** U.S. citizen athletes should carefully review their contract before accepting a job offer or moving to Montenegro. Some professional athletes report contract disputes about treatment and living conditions. U.S. citizen-athletes should research the team, living arrangements, and the city or town where they will live before accepting an offer.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Montenegrin law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, or mental disabilities. The law is generally enforced; however, acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.

Expect communications and information to be limited. Accessibility may be limited in older facilities. Accessibility is common in some public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure. Discrimination against persons with disabilities is more visible in smaller towns in the country.
