# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads in Montenegro are not up to U.S. standards, especially in rural areas. Roads near the coast are in better condition but are overcrowded during the summer. Drivers can be reckless and aggressive, and accidents are frequent.

Dangerous areas for road travel include a road through the Moraca Canyon, north of Podgorica. This twisting, two-lane road is especially overcrowded in the summer and is the site of frequent rockslides. In the winter, the Moraca Canyon and northern parts of Montenegro are covered with snow, which may slow traffic and make the road hazardous.

It is common for drivers to pass on winding roads and hills.

**Traffic Laws:**

* The use of seat belts is mandatory.
* Cell phone usage while driving is prohibited.
* Vehicle lights must always be on.
* Right turns on red lights are prohibited, unless a distinct green arrow is seen.
* At unmarked intersections, the right of way is always given to the vehicle entering from the right.
* Each vehicle must have a reflective fluorescent vest and an emergency kit, as well as a European car accident report form. This form can be purchased in local automobile shops. Please note that the accident report form is in Montenegrin. If a car is rented from a Montenegrin rental car agency, these items should be provided.
* Children 5 years-old and under must use a safety seat attached to a vehicle safety belt.
* Vehicles must have snow tires and carry snow chains between November 15 and March 30.
* Pedestrians crossing in designated crosswalks have the right of way. Drivers must stop.
* The blood alcohol limit in Montenegro is .03 percent, less than half the legal limit in the United States.

**Taxis:** Metered taxis are safe, although foreigners are sometimes charged higher rates. Taxis generally do not pick up passengers on the street and must be ordered by phone or SMS.

**Public Transportation:** Trains, buses, and ferries often use aging and poorly maintained equipment.

**Roadside assistance** is available by dialing 19807, +382 20 234 467 or +382 0 20 234 999. Other local emergency numbers are police: 122; fire department: 123; and ambulance: 124.

For emergencies dial 112.
