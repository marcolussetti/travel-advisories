# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

There are no COVID-related entry requirements for U.S. citizens.

U.S. citizen visitors (traveling with U.S. passports) do not need a visa to enter and stay in Montenegro for up to 90 days. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.

* Visitors are required to register their stay in local municipalities in Montenegro.
* Hotels or tourist facilities automatically register your stay in Montenegro.
* If you do not stay at a hotel, you must go to the local tourism office to register and pay local tourist taxes.
* If you are staying in different locations in Montenegro, you must register in each municipality in which you are staying for more than 24 hours.
* If you do not register, you may be subject to a fine, incarceration, deportation, and/or difficulties departing Montenegro.
* For more information, please visit Montenegrin Ministry of Interior [page.](https://www.gov.me/en/mup)

Stays of longer than 90 days:

* U.S. citizens staying longer than 90 days must apply for a temporary residence permit at least one month before the 90-day period ends [here](https://www.developmentaid.org/donors/view/89038/ministry-of-the-interior-montenegro).
* Apply for your residency permit as soon as possible, due to long processing times. All required U.S. state and federal government documents must have an apostille affixed.
* These documents include:
  + U.S. birth and marriage certificates
  + The FBI criminal background clearance
* Please note that the U.S. Embassy in Montenegro does not have the authority to affix an apostille to these documents. For information on how an apostille can be attached to these documents, please see the [State Department’s Apostille page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/apostille-requirements.html).

You can contact the [Embassy of Montenegro](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Montenegro.html#ExternalPopup) in Washington, D.C. for the most current visa information.

**Currency and Customs Restrictions:**

* Travelers must declare currency exceeding 10,000 euros (or equivalent) upon entry or exit.
* To avoid fines, travelers must declare luxury goods, jewelry, paintings, and computer equipment. Travelers can obtain currency declaration forms at ports of entry.
* Travelers who violate customs policies or currency declaration requirements risk confiscation of their funds/goods and criminal proceedings.
