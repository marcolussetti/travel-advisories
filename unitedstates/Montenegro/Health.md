For emergency services in Montenegro, dial 123 for the fire department. For ambulance dial 124. Dial 112 to report a crime or request police help.

Ambulance services have limited availability and lack state-of-the-art medical equipment. Emergency services are generally responsive in only the most severe cases. Otherwise, people must obtain their own transportation to hospitals and clinics.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Many care providers overseas only accept cash payments. Few now accept credit cards. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.
