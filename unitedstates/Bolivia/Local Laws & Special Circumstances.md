# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. People starting a business or practicing a licensed profession should seek information from local authorities. They need to do this before practicing or operating.

Bolivian authorities are **generally** required to press official charges within 24 hours of arrest. They must release a detainee within 48 hours if no formal charges are brought. However, investigative and pre-trial periods may drag on **indefinitely**.

Bolivian law lets police detain any foreigner. They can detain them until they show proof of legal status in the country. This proof can be a passport, visa, or residency card. Though this is rarely enforced, anyone who cannot produce proof of legal status may be detained until legal status is confirmed.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

In Bolivia, you may find products made with wild plants and animals. Many of these products could involve protected or endangered species, whose sale and export are illegal. Bolivian authorities could seize any protected species that is sold or transported. This applies to live animals or products, like food, drinks, leather, crafts, or clothes. Some products, including live animals, require special permits to leave Bolivia. Knowingly importing into the United States wildlife or plants that were taken from the wild or sold in violation of the laws of Bolivia (or any other country) violates U.S. law.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* In Bolivia, suspects can be held up to 18 months without charges. The detention period can then be extended beyond 18 months. Legal cases often drag on for years.

**Mountain Trekking and Climbing Safety**: Many popular trekking routes in the Bolivian Andes are at 16,000 feet or higher. No matter your medical history or fitness, the high altitude may harm you. Exercise extreme caution when trekking or climbing in Bolivia.

* Trekkers must have enough clothing and gear. These are not always available locally. They should be experienced in the mountains.
* **Don’t trek alone**. Join an organized group and/or use a reputable firm to obtain an experienced guide and porter.
* If you develop a severe headache, weakness, vomiting, shortness of breath at rest, cough, chest tightness, or unsteadiness while climbing, descend to a lower altitude right away. Also, consider seeking medical attention.
* Trekkers and climbers should buy insurance. It should cover emergency services, like medical evacuations.
* Satellite communication and internet connectivity can be limited or non-existent. Inform family members of your plans and note that you may not be reachable for extended periods.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are common in many countries, but they may still be illegal under local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** The Bolivian constitution prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Bolivia.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** Bolivian law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. But it is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common accessibility issues may include: accessible facilities, information, and communication. Also, access to services and ease of movement. When traveling, public transportation, lodging, and communication may not be easy to use. Infrastructure can also pose accessibility limitations.

**Women Travelers:** Bolivia has one of the highest domestic violence rates against women in South America. A very high percentage of women in Bolivia have experienced intimate partner violence.
