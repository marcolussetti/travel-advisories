**COVID-19 Testing:**Numerous private and public clinics throughout Bolivia offer COVID-19 testing. For a comprehensive list of COVID-19 testing centers, please visit our [medical assistance page](https://bo.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).

The Servicio Departamental de Salud (SEDES) is the agency that regulates COVID-19 testing in Bolivia. There are 9 branches of SEDES in the 9 Departments of Bolivia.

* The first step is to contact SEDES for evaluation at 800-10-2930.
* Antigen and RT-PCR tests are both widely available. The two available tests are the Quick Test and the PCR test.
* The tests are available at most private labs and in some hospitals.
* The price for an Antigen test is around 150bs. The cost for a RT-PCR test is approximately 450bs.
* COVID-19 tests results can be issued by email, text messages or physical copies.

**COVID-19 Vaccines:** The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Bolivia. Visit the FDA's website to [learn more about FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

Medical care in large cities is adequate, but of varying quality. Hospitals cannot handle serious conditions. The risk of infection is high. Emergency medical care outside of large cities, in rural areas, and inside national parks is inadequate.

**For emergency services in Bolivia, dial 110.**

Ambulance services are rare. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) for more information. They can tell you what type of insurance to consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging. Also bring your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bolivia.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Bolivia.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Health facilities in general:**

Private hospitals usually need payment upfront, or they need proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient. **Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery:**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States. They are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in medical travel should ask their local doctor before going. They should also visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) website for more information on Medical Tourism.

**Pharmaceuticals:**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medicine is common. It may not work, be too strong or weak, or contain harmful ingredients. You should buy medication in consultation with a medical professional. Buy it from reputable sellers.

* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) websites for more information.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:**

* If you are considering traveling to Bolivia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html) [page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).

**Water Quality:**

* In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and drinks are generally safe but be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled water. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**

* Many cities in Bolivia, such as La Paz, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.
