# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Use extreme caution when driving on roadways. Few highways have shoulders, fencing or barriers, and lane markings are minimal. Even when lanes are marked, it is common for drivers to disregard them.

* Although La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba are connected by highways, most roads in Bolivia are unpaved.
* **Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended** for trips outside major cities.
* Travel during the rainy season (November-March) is difficult, as most routes have potholes, and roads and bridges may be washed out.
* Other dangers include poor maintenance and overloaded vehicles. Some vehicles lack lights. Also, there are intoxicated or overly tired drivers. This includes commercial bus and truck drivers. Stop signs are rare, and drivers commonly disregard red lights, particularly at night.

**Traffic Laws:**Most drivers lack formal training. Maintain situational awareness on the roads and employ defensive driving skills.

* Drivers do not normally yield to pedestrians.
* **If you are involved in a traffic accident**, stay at the scene until local police arrive. Leaving the scene is illegal under Bolivian law. The police may assess a percentage of fault to you relative to their assessment of your responsibility for the incident.

**Public Transportation:**

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

* Avoid taking unlicensed taxis and **use radio taxis** whenever possible.
* The majority of intercity travel is by minibus, with varying levels of safety and service. **Bus accidents are responsible for death and severe injuries.**

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Bolivia’s Civil Aviation Authority to be in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Bolivia’s air carrier operations.
