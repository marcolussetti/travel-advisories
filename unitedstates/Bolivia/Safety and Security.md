# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Chapare Region**: Criminal groups operate in this region. Also, authorities have used force in past confrontations with residents over coca eradication. Pro-coca groups may try to target U.S. interests. [Contact the Embassy](https://bo.usembassy.gov/contact/) before traveling to this regions.

**Crime**: Pick pocketing and petty theft are common.

* Express kidnappings, in which tourists are robbed and forced to withdraw money from ATMs, occur infrequently in La Paz. Use only marked (radio) taxis and don’t travel alone, particularly late at night or if you’re under the influence of alcohol or other substances.
* **Avoid Coronilla Hill in Cochabamba** next to the main bus terminal, due to crime.
* **Use caution if you plan to travel from Copacabana to La Paz by bus.** Arrive during daylight hours if possible, verify the final destination, and buy tickets directly at the bus terminal.
* **Be aware of impostors.** Organized criminal groups sometimes pose as police with the intent to rob foreigners. It is also a common scheme for criminals to pose as a crime victim, only to rob an unsuspecting bystander.
* **Theft of bags, wallets, and backpacks are a problem,** especially in tourist areas and on overnight buses. Thieves sometimes distract victims by spraying water on their necks or putting a substance on their bags. They use this trick to get the victims to give up their bags. Never leave personal items unattended.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may happen in response to political or economic issues. They also happen on important holidays and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Avoid roadblocks or public demonstrations.
* Consider the possibility of flight disruptions.
* Take extra food, water, and warm clothing on road trips. Roadblocks may occur without warning and could strand you for several days.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Inspectors rarely check equipment and facilities for safety. Hazardous areas and activities might lack proper signs. Staff may lack training or certification by the host government or by recognized authorities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders can't reach areas outside major cities. They can't provide urgent medical treatment there.
