# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

All U.S. citizens visiting Bolivia are required to obtain a visa. Most types of visas are only available at a Bolivian Embassy or Consulate in the United States or neighboring country. Tourist visas can also be purchased at any land or air border. U.S. citizens can apply to extend their initial 30-day stay. They can do this through the Dirección General de Migración (National Migration Service). They have offices in most major cities. Visit the [U.S. Embassy in Bolivia](https://bo.usembassy.gov/) website for the most current visa information.

**Entry Requirements:**

* Valid U.S. passport with at least six months validity remaining.
* International Certificate of Yellow Fever Vaccination.
* With a visitor visa, you may stay 30 days per trip, not to exceed 90 days per year. A Bolivian visitor visa costs $160 US and can be paid in U.S. or local currency upon arrival.
* Visitors must show proof of a round-trip ticket or confirmation of plans to depart Bolivia.
* Visitors must provide proof of lodging in Bolivia including the address of the accommodation. If you are staying with friends or family, authorities may require a letter of invitation from the host.
* Visitors must provide proof of economic solvency (i.e., photocopy of bank statements, etc.)
* If you purchase a visa at the airport, you will be required to provide a photocopy of your passport biographic page.
* If you plan to work, study, volunteer, or conduct business in Bolivia, you must apply for a separate visa.
* Make sure you get entry and exit stamps from the Bolivian authorities every time you enter or leave Bolivia.
* If you got the Bolivian visa at a land border or entry port and you lose your passport, you'll need to get a new visa. You'll also need to pay the $160 US visa fee to leave the country. If you got your Bolivian visa at the Bolivian Embassy/Consulate in the United States and you lose your passport, you will need to get an exit stamp. But, you will not need to pay the visa fee.
* Bolivian citizen minors traveling alone or with one parent, who have stayed in Bolivia for over 90 days, will need permission from the non-traveling parent or parents to leave Bolivia. They may also need to show the original birth certificate.  For more information, please [contact the Embassy](https://bo.usembassy.gov/).
