# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Guinea-Bissau lacks sufficient resources and infrastructure to ensure a stable security environment.

Visit the [U.S. Embassy Dakar](https://sn.usembassy.gov/)website for current messages to U.S. citizens regarding safety and security. Please register your travel through the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program￼](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMXe4qbhiwMVcFtHAR0HYRl7EAAYASAAEgIZlvD_BwE).

**Crime**: Non-violent crimes occur frequently. Law enforcement lacks the resources to respond effectively to crime.

Expatriates and travelers are occasionally targeted for crimes of opportunity (petty theft, pickpocketing, theft from vehicles, minor assaults). Street criminals, aggressive vendors, and panhandlers frequently target foreigners in crowded areas and markets (particularly the Bandim Market) and travelers exiting the Bissau airport. According to law enforcement officials, travelers should also be cautious of the Mindara and Reino neighborhoods due to crime.

Risk of crimes increases at night, due to Guinea-Bissau's limited security infrastructure and lack of street and building lighting. You are strongly discouraged from walking alone after dark or in isolated areas. Even during daylight hours and in groups, you are advised to maintain a heightened level of security awareness, particularly in public places, tourist areas, and crowded locations.

Police and emergency personnel are poorly trained and lack resources to respond to crime and emergency situations effectively. Even if the police do respond to an incident, they usually lack the training and experience to conduct a proper investigation.

All foreign visitors should carry identification (such as a certified copy of passport and/or residence permit) at all times.

Narcotics trafficking is linked to criminal activity and aggressive assaults in rural areas of Guinea-Bissau.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Scams**:Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Guinea-Bissau. See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers often pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams center around:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Offers of lucrative sales
* Offers of contracts with promises of large commissions
* Offers of free trips/luggage
* Lotteries
* Work permits/job offers
* U.S. visa opportunities

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime**: U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Dakar at +221 33-879-4000.

While local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime, police and emergency personnel in Guinea-Bissau may lack the basic resources necessary to effectively respond to crime and emergency situations.
