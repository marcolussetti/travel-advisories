# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Guinea-Bissau lacks sufficient resources and infrastructure to ensure a stable security environment. Guinea-Bissau’s instability is exacerbated by drug trafficking, as it is used as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America.

**Crime**: Non-violent crimes occur frequently. Law enforcement lacks the resources to respond effectively to crime.

Expatriates and travelers are occasionally targeted for crimes of opportunity (petty theft, pickpocketing, theft from vehicles, minor assaults). Street criminals, aggressive vendors, and panhandlers frequently target foreigners in crowded areas and markets (particularly the popular Bandim Market) and travelers exiting the Bissau airport. According to law enforcement officials, travelers should also be cautious of the Mindara and Reino neighborhoods due to crime.

The risk of being targeted by criminal actors greatly increases at night, due to Guinea-Bissau`s limited security infrastructure and lack of street and building lighting. Visitors are strongly discouraged from walking after dark, especially alone or in isolated areas. Even during daylight hours and in groups, travelers are advised to maintain a heightened level of security awareness, particularly in public places, tourist areas, and crowded locations.

Corruption exists at all levels of government. Police and emergency personnel are poorly trained and lack resources to respond to crime and emergency situations effectively. Even if the police do respond to an incident, they usually lack the training and experience to conduct a proper investigation.

People violating Bissau-Guinean laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or temporarily detained. All foreign visitors should carry identification (such as a certified copy of passport and/or residence permit).

Narcotics trafficking is linked to criminal activity and aggressive assaults in rural areas of Guinea-Bissau.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Guinea-Bissau.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers often pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Work permits/job offers
* U.S. visa opportunities

**Victims of Crime**: Police and emergency personnel in Guinea-Bissau lack the basic resources necessary to effectively respond to crime and emergency situations.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.
