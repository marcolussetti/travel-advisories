Modern medical facilities are virtually nonexistent in Guinea-Bissau, and travelers should not rely on the facilities that are available unless it is unavoidable. No emergency services are available in Guinea-Bissau. More acceptable levels of medical care are available in Senegal.

Ambulance services are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders are below U.S. standards. Existing ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

The U.S. Embassy in Dakar maintains a list of local doctors and hospitals on our [webpage](https://sn.usembassy.gov/)under "local resources." We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

See our [Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) page for more information.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health page. CDC Traveler Advice provides advice on medical considerations, including:

* Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
* Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
* General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) webpage for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) that covers medical evacuation.

**Water Quality**: Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Wash raw vegetables and fruits in a bleach solution before eating.

**Air Quality**:

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several cities in Guinea-Bissau. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst during the Harmattan winds in January and February, which frequently carry dust and sand particles from the Sahara and result in poor air quality throughout the country. People at greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, or emphysema
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
