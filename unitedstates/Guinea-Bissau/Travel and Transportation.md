# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Urban and rural road conditions, and availability of roadside assistance, are all poor.

While there has been significant progress in locating and removing land mines left in place from Guinea-Bissau’s civil war and war of independence, a substantial number remain. You should not leave designated roads and pathways and should not drive at night. The land mines are scattered in several areas throughout Guinea-Bissau, including Bafata, Oio, Biombo, Quinara, and Tombali.

**Public Transportation**: Exercise caution if using taxis, as many are in sub-standard condition. If you do take a taxi, for your safety, inform the driver that you do not want additional patrons to be picked up along the route, as taxis in Bissau serve as a type of bus service, in which each passenger pays for a seat rather than the whole vehicle. Furthermore, the Embassy does not recommend that visitors use the informal bus system in Bissau called “Bus Rapides” or “Toca-Tocas.”

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Guinea-Bissau’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s website includes more information on its assessment program.

**Maritime Travel**: Mariners planning travel to Guinea-Bissau should also check for U.S. maritime [advisories](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories) and [alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Guinea-Bissau ports. Therefore, the Commandant has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports, after visiting Guinea-Bissau ports. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Guinea-Bissau should exercise caution.
