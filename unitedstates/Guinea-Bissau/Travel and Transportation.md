While there has been significant progress in locating and removing land mines left in place from Guinea-Bissau’s civil war and war of independence, a substantial number remain. Travelers should not leave designated roads and pathways and should not drive at night. The land mines are scattered in several areas throughout Guinea-Bissau, including the Bafata, Oio, Biombo, Quinara, and Tombali regions.

**Public Transportation**: The public transportation system, urban and rural road conditions, and availability of roadside assistance are all poor.

Exercise caution if using taxis as many are in sub-standard condition. If you do take a taxi, for your safety, inform the driver that you do not want additional patrons to be picked up along the route, as taxis in Bissau serve as a type of bus service, in which each passenger pays for a seat. Furthermore, the Embassy does not recommend that visitors use the informal bus system in Bissau, the “Bus Rapides” or “Toca-Tocas.”

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Guinea-Bissau, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Guinea-Bissau’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel**: Mariners planning travel to Guinea-Bissau should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-advisories). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) website, and the [NGA broadcast warnings website](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal;jsessionid=ZH8vhpMLsRlhyYmGhsQmq712yBFWrSvYnnNWfPFbZHtddspH3KzQ!863626413!-1887722738?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63).
