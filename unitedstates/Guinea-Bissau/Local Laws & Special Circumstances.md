# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you breaklocal laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should getinformation from the local authoritiesbefore you start.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Guinea-Bissau are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

Furthermore, some crimesare also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) webpage and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Senegal immediately. See our [webpage](https://sn.usembassy.gov/) for further information.

**Currency**:Guinea-Bissau's currency is the franc of the Communauté Financière d'Afrique (fCFA), which has an exchange rate fixed to the Euro. Guinea-Bissau’s economy operates primarily on a cash basis. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Although ATMs are available in some areas (primarily Bissau), they are not always reliable and should generally be avoided. You may be able to transfer money from the United States using a commercial wire-transfer company.

**LGB Travelers**: See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and Section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details. There are no laws that criminalize sexual orientation in Guinea-Bissau. Nevertheless, LGB people face discrimination. Cases of violence against the LGB community often go unreported due to stigma or fear of retaliation.

**Students**: See our Students Abroad page and [FBI travel tips](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information).

**Travelers with Disabilities**: The law in Guinea-Bissau prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, most lodging facilities, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The availability of rental, repair, or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, including service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city.

See our [Travelers with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

**Women Travelers**: Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime punishable by 2-6 years in prison. Domestic violence is illegal, but widespread and rarely prosecuted. Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is against the law but is still commonly practiced, especially in the north of the country.
