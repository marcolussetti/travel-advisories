# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Guinea-Bissau are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Drug trafficking is endemic in Guinea-Bissau.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See the following webpages for details:

**LGB Travelers**: See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details. There are no laws that criminalize sexual orientation in Guinea-Bissau. LGB people face discrimination. The cases of violence against LGB community often are unreported due to stigma or fear of retaliation.

**Students**: See our [Students Abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/studentsabroad/en.html) page and [FBI travel tips](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure).

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Guinea-Bissau prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, the availability of information, access to services and ease of movement. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, most lodging facilities, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The availability of rental, repair, or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, including service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city.

**Women Travelers**: Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime punishable by 2-6 years in prison. Domestic violence is illegal, but widespread and rarely prosecuted.

Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is against the law but is still commonly practiced, especially in the north of the country.
