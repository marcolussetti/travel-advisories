*Updated to reflect addition of health risk indicator and update to “If you decide to travel” section.*

Reconsider travel to Guinea-Bissau due to **civil unrest, crime,** and **health**.

**Country Summary:** The country has had periods of political instability for decades. Past demonstrations have escalated into violence. Access to health care is limited.

**Crime** is common in Guinea-Bissau:

* Aggressive vendors, panhandlers, and criminals target foreigners at the Bissau airport.
* Criminals also target crowded areas, especially Bandim Market in the capital’s center.
* Local police do not have the resources to respond quickly to serious crimes.
* The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. There is no U.S. Embassy in Guinea-Bissau.

Health care in Guinea-Bissau is limited. Facilities may not have adequate supplies of basic medications, especially outside of larger cities. It is highly recommended to have medical evacuation insurance for travel to Guinea-Bissau. Travelers should carry a supply of any needed prescription medicines, along with copies of their prescriptions and include the generic names of medicines, as well as a supply of over-the-counter medications (such as anti-diarrheals and pain medication).
