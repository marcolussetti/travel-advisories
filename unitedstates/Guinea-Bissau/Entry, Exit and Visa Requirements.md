# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

To enter Guinea-Bissau, you need:

* A valid passport with at least six months’ validity.
* A valid visa. Visa upon arrival is available in Bissau. Guinea-Bissau operates an embassy in the United States, but visa services are not available as of March 2025. Since most flights destined for Guinea-Bissau must pass through Dakar, Senegal, or Lisbon, Portugal, you can also apply for visas at the Bissau-Guinean embassies in those countries.
* Proof of onward/return ticket.
* An International Certificate of Vaccination (yellow card) with a record of vaccination against yellow fever.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Guinea-Bissau.
