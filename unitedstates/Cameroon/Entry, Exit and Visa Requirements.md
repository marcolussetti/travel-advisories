# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport
* Visa
* Current immunization records, including evidence of yellow fever vaccination are required for entry into Cameroon.
* World Health Organization (WHO) card with yellow fever vaccination.
* Proof of polio vaccination for visits longer than four weeks.

**Visas:** Obtain your visa before traveling. Visit the [Embassy of Cameroon](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Cameroon.html#ExternalPopup) website for the most current visa information.

**Dual Nationality:** Cameroon does not recognize dual nationality. U.S. citizens should always present themselves as U.S. citizens to Cameroonian authorities, regardless of their country of birth. U.S. citizens must always enter and exit Cameroon on a U.S. passport with a valid Cameroonian visa otherwise they are liable to be denied entry or detained. Furthermore, presenting oneself as a Cameroonian citizen may impede our ability to provide consular services.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Cameroon.
