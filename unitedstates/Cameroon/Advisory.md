**Northwest and Southwest Regions – Level 4: Do Not Travel**

In Northwest and Southwest Regions, armed clashes between separatists and government forces, and other acts of violence, including violent criminality, kidnapping for ransom, sexual assault, arson, roadside ambushes and robberies, use of improvised explosive devices, illegitimate detentions, and murder have occurred. Security force operations, curfews and movement restrictions, and attacks by armed militants can take place at any time throughout these regions, including in urban areas. Ongoing violence has led to a breakdown in order and a significant decline in public services, including medical resources in large areas of both regions.
