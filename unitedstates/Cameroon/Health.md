For emergency services in Cameroon, dial the number of the hospital in the area where you are located. There is currently no national number for general health-related emergencies in the country.

Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Yaoundé and Douala.
* Not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* Not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of Cameroon to ensure the medication is legal in Cameroon.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Cameroon.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals available on [this page](https://cm.usembassy.gov/services/#local) under "local resources." We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Health care in many areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Public medical clinics may lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Medical staff may communicate primarily in French and speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse if the hospital is amenable or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Cameroon.
* Although Cameroon has elective/cosmetic surgery facilities, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Cameroon, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.
* Persons traveling to Cameroon for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Check the Government of Cameroon’s website for more information.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) websites for more information.
* Cameroon may not allow the importation of some medication. Travelers should avoid carrying any prohibited medication. Please review Cameroon rules on medication or contact the [Ministry of Health's Directorate of Pharmacies and Medications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Cameroon.html#ExternalPopup).

**Non-Traditional Medicine**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners overseas. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Cameroon to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* If you decide to pursue parenthood in Cameroon via assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a gestational mother, be prepared for long and unexpected delays in documenting your child’s citizenship. Be aware that individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution.

**Water Quality**

* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors
