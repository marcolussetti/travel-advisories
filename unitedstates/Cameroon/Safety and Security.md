# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa are active in Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon. Suicide bombings have occurred in public places in and around urban areas resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Terrorist attacks are most common outside major towns, especially in the regions bordering [Nigeria](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Nigeria.html) and [Chad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Chad.html). Extremists have frequently target areas of congregation, particularly camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). While most victims of terrorist attacks in Cameroon have been locals, violent extremist organizations may seek to target Westerners or conduct other high-profile operations. Kidnapping by terrorist organizations remains a concern. Refrain from traveling outside of cities or towns after dark and exercise caution when in the vicinity of potential targets.

There is ongoing violence in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security force operations and attacks by armed militants regularly take place throughout these Regions including in major cities. Neighboring areas of other regions are at risk of spillover violence, including Douala. Use of improvised explosives and incendiary devices, kidnappings, illegitimate detentions, and acts of violent criminality by armed actors have also occurred in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security forces, government officials, road travelers, administrative buildings, schools, and commercial areas have been repeatedly attacked. Those suspected of being associated, even tangentially, with the central government or armed militants have been targeted for reprisals by a variety of elements.

**Border Areas**: Cameroon’s borders remain porous. Terrorists regularly cross the border into Cameroon from Nigeria and Chad to conduct attacks in the Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions. Militant activities and security operations routinely occur along Cameroon’s shared border with Nigeria in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. Armed criminals and communal militia frequently conduct attacks in border areas abutting the [Central African Republic](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/CentralAfricanRepublic.html) (CAR).

Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to the Northwest, Southwest, North, and Far North Regions of Cameroon, as well as within 20 kilometers of the border with the Central African Republic in Adamawa and East Regions, and within 20 kilometers of the border with Nigeria and north of Ngaoudere in the Adamawa Region.

**Bakassi Peninsula:** Cameroon's military authorities restrict access to the Bakassi Peninsula. U.S. citizens should avoid this area.

**Use of Improvised Explosive Devices**: Multiple improvised explosive device (IED) attacks have occurred in Douala and Yaoundé since June 2020. The threat for similar attacks could take place countrywide. Various armed actors, to include terrorists and political militants, may use such devices. To date, recent IED incidents have not directly targeted U.S. citizens or areas frequented by Westerners, however the risk of wrong place/wrong time violence remains. Locations with a high security force or government presence may be at increased risk of being targeted.

**Crime:** Violent and opportunistic crime is prevalent throughout the country including major cities. Foreigners in Cameroon have been victims of all types of crime including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, carjacking, burglary, theft, armed robbery, and home invasion. Criminals often employ violence, particularly in instances where victims attempt to resist. The risk of street and residential crime is especially high, even in affluent areas with a large police and private security presence.

**Transport Crimes:** **U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using taxis.** Violent assaults on taxi passengers are common. Petty theft is prevalent, particularly on trains, buses, and taxis.

The Hilton and Mont Febe hotels offer a shuttle service from Yaoundé-Nsimalen Airport to downtown Yaoundé. Travelers are encouraged to use this service or retain the services of a reputable private transport company.

* Avoid walking alone especially after dark.
* Do not display cash and valuables.
* Drive with doors locked and windows closed.
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Maritime Security**: Piracy and armed robbery continue to increase throughout the Gulf of Guinea including Cameroon’s waters. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common and may occur near coastal areas or deep waters. More information on current conditions may be found on the [Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page.](https://www.oni.navy.mil/News/Shipping-Threat-Reports/)

**Communications:** During periods of heightened unrest or insecurity, there is a heightened risk of communications disruptions which may affect internet access, social media, mobile messaging, and cellular voice calls. These disruptions may be localized or countrywide.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

* Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Cameroon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:
* Romance/online dating
* Financial transactions/money transfers
* Too good to be true purchases or sales
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers

U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 117 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (237) 22220-1500. Dial + (237) 22222-2525 in Yaoundé or dial 112 in major cities to contact ambulance services.

**Victims of Crime:** **Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in Douala and Yaoundé. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of these two cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
