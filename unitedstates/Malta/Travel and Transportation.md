**TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:** Maltese drivers may drive more aggressively and with less caution than visitors anticipate. Roads flood easily and are often narrow, winding and congested, with poor visibility around curves.

* In Malta, automobiles drive on the left-hand side of the road.
* Buses are the primary means of public transportation.
* **Taxis** are safe but expensive and are **not metered**. **Agree on the charge with the driver in advance**.

Please see our [road safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of Malta’s [national tourist office](http://www.visitmalta.com/driving) and national authority responsible for road safety.
