# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. **Your** **U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution**.

* **Penalties** for possessing, using, or trafficking in **illegal drugs** in Malta are **severe**.
* Malta’s laws on the **rights of arrestees** are different from the United States. For example, once you have contacted a lawyer, you lose your right to remain silent.

**Judicial Proceedings for Criminal Offenses in Malta:** Trials typically last **five to seven years** and are characterized by **lengthy** and sometimes **unpredictable** **delays** between hearings. Foreign nationals can expect to be denied bail while a court case is ongoing, which can result in **lengthy periods of pre-trial detention** ranging from several months to several years. Obtaining no-fee legal aid can be a slow and difficult process, delaying already lengthy judicial proceedings.

Furthermore, some crimes are also **prosecutable in the United States** regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs and Currency Restrictions:** Malta customs authorities may enforce **strict regulations** concerning currency restrictions and temporary importation into or export from Malta of items such as **firearms**, **antiquities**, or any item that might be deemed to have resale value. It is advisable to contact the Maltese Embassy in Washington, D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements.

* Malta’s customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet for the temporary admission of professional equipment, commercial samples and/or goods for exhibitions and fair purposes. The [U.S. Council for International Business](https://www.uscib.org/ata-carnet-export-service-ud-718/) issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Very few public or private spaces in Malta are wheelchair accessible. Public transportation and most sidewalks or footpaths, including road crossings, are not accessible for those with mobility challenges. Many apartments lack elevators.

* Taxis are readily available, but the cost is substantially higher than public buses.
