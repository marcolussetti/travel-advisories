# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Malta’s open borders with members of the Schengen zone allow the possibility of individual terrorists entering/exiting the country undetected.

**CRIME:** The most commonly reported crimes are **simple assault**, **pick-pocketing**, and **petty theft**. While armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides are not as common as in some major U.S. cities, they do occur. Criminals focus on areas and establishments frequented by tourists.

* Secure your valuables, and be aware of pick-pockets and purse snatchers.
* **Theft of unattended property** is a very common problem.

See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Nightclubs:** You should be careful in the **Paceville** nightclub area, where excessive drinking, large crowds, and interaction with heavy-handed bouncers can lead to **violence**, including some that appears to be **racially-motivated**. Criminals have **drugged** some travelers at bars and **robbed** and **assaulted** them.

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police by **dialing 112** and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+356) 2561-4000.

**Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.**

The local equivalent to the **911 emergency line** in Malta is **112**.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur on a regular basis.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
