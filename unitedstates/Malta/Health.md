Medical care is available from private and government clinics and hospitals. The quality of medical care in Malta is **at U.S. standards; however, customer service standards are lower, there are cultural differences with regard to communication, and there may be long waiting times for non-urgent medical care**. Medical specialists are few. Private hospitals generally offer better customer service, shorter wait times, and more amenities. Mater Dei is Malta’s main government hospital. Though it offers full service, including a modern emergency room and trauma facilities, it can be crowded and difficult to navigate.

**The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. **Medicare** does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides **coverage overseas**. Most overseas care providers only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.

**We strongly recommend** [**supplemental insurance**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) **to cover medical evacuation.**

If traveling with **prescription medication**, check with the Government of **Malta and its** [**Medicines Authority**](http://www.medicinesauthority.gov.mt/home?l=1)to ensure the medication is **legal in Malta**.Always carry your prescription medication in **original packaging** with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
