# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads in Serbia are not always well-maintained, especially in rural areas and in southern Serbia.

* Exercise caution when driving on roads in southern Serbia in the winter.
* Drivers should also be cautious when driving along Serbia’s Ibarska Magistrala, the highway between Belgrade and Čačak, because of the higher rate of accidents.
* Winter fog in Serbia is another concern because it significantly reduces visibility and is especially heavy in the Vojvodina region between Belgrade and the Hungarian border.

**Roadside assistance** is available by **dialing 987** locally. The local numbers for the police and ambulance are 192 and 194, respectively.

**Traffic Laws:**

* You may use a U.S. driver’s license together with an international driving permit in Serbia for up to six months, after which time you may have to obtain a Serbian driver’s license.
* Drivers with a blood alcohol level higher than 0.02% are considered intoxicated and face arrest, prosecution, and fines.
* You must wear a seat belt while driving or riding in a car in Serbia.
* You may not use a mobile phone while driving in Serbia except with a hands-free system.

**Public Transportation:** Belgrade and some other large cities in Serbia have public transportation networks. Buses are often crowded, and some lines and vehicles are poorly maintained. There is also intercity bus and train service for many locations in Serbia.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Serbia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Serbia’s air carrier operations.
