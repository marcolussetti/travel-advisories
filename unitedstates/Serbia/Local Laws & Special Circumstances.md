# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/).

Before establishing a business or practicing a profession seek information from the competent local authorities.

**Arrest Notification**:

If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:**

Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See [the U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**

There are no legal restrictions on same-sex relations in Serbia or on the organization of LGB events.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**

The law in Serbia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public may be lower than in the United States. Facilities, information, and communication may be accessible. Expect limited accessibility in lodging, general infrastructure, and public transportation throughout Serbia.

**Bringing Money into Serbia:**

If you enter Serbia with more than 10,000 euro in cash (or equivalent in other currencies), you must declare it to customs. If you fail to do so, Serbian customs may confiscate your money or levy heavy fines. Please review our [customs information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) for additional details.
