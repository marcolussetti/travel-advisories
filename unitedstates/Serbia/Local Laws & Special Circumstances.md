# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations in Serbia or on the organization of LGB events. Serbia has active and increasingly-visible LGB advocacy groups, and several LGB bars operate openly and without problems in Belgrade. Many recent LGB public eventshave been held without incident. However, LGB travelers should exercise caution when visiting Serbia. Many LGB persons in Serbia choose not to openly reveal their sexual orientation or show public displays of affection due to security and safety concerns, and many avoid reporting incidents to police. Similarly, many LGB persons often find themselves targets of discrimination and violence and therefore may make the choice to hide or modify their identities when in public spaces. Though a growing number of police officers have received training on how to work with LGB individuals, including when they are victims of crime, many have limited experience and knowledge.

For further general information on travel abroad by LGB individuals, please read our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Serbia prohibits discrimination against persons with  physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging, and general infrastructure, and common in public transportation.While there is some accessibility for travelers with disabilities in Belgrade and Novi Sad, there are limited to no accessibility in the rest of Serbia.

* Rental of aids/equipment/devices is available: There several companies that sell, rent and repair aids/equipment/devices. Among the most known ones are [Centar Eliksir](https://eliksir.co.rs/) and [Ortopedija mc](https://ortopedija-mc.rs/).

**Bringing Money into Serbia:**If you enter Serbia with more than 10,000 euro in cash (or equivalent in other currencies), you must declare it to customs. If you fail to do so, Serbian customs may confiscate your money or levy heavy fines. Please review our [customs information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html) for additional details.
