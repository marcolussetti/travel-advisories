[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Serbia's website](http://www.washington.mfa.gov.rs/consularservicestext.php?subaction=showfull&id=1348565352&ucat=17&template=MeniENG&#disqus_thread) for the most current visa information.

* U.S. citizens do not need a visa to enter and stay in Serbia for up to 90 days.
* It is important to enter and exit Serbia using the same passport. U.S. citizens who also hold Serbian citizenship should always enter and exit Serbia on their Serbian passport.
* If you lose your U.S. passport after arriving in Serbia, you must obtain a police report and a new passport prior to departure.
* You cannot enter Serbia using an expired passport or one that has previously been reported lost or stolen. Immigration authorities will deny you entry and return you to the city from which you flew to Serbia.
* U.S. citizens must register with the local police within 24 hours of arrival.  Hotels or similar accommodation will do this for you.  If you are staying at a private residence, you will need to register in person at the nearest police station.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Serbia.

**Temporary Residence Permits:** If you wish to stay in Serbia longer than 90 days during any 180-day period, you must apply for a temporary residence permit from the local police with jurisdiction over where you are staying in Serbia. You cannot apply for a residence permit from outside of Serbia.

* For information about how to apply for a temporary residency permit, please visit the [Serbian Ministry of Interior’s website](http://www.mup.rs/wps/portal/en/ministry).
* All application documents submitted for temporary residence will require an ‘apostille’ stamp from the government office where you got the document. To learn more about apostilles and other official documents, please see the [Office of Authentications page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document.html).

**Special Guidance for Travel to and from Kosovo:**

* Serbian border officials do not recognize the authority of Kosovo’s government.
* Serbia will not grant entry to travelers who try to enter Serbia from Kosovo without first having previously entered Serbia from another recognized entry point and obtaining a Serbian entry stamp.
* Example: A traveler who arrives in Serbia by air and drives directly to Kosovo (not through a third country) will be permitted to re-enter Serbia directly from Kosovo.
* Example: A traveler who arrives in Kosovo by land or air from a third country (not Serbia) and then plans to travel by land to Serbia must first exit Kosovo via its border with either Montenegro or North Macedonia and then proceed to a border crossing with Serbia.
