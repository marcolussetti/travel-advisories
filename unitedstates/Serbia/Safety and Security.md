# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists worldwide are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, they target unprotected or vulnerable venues, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Anti-U.S. Sentiments:** While Serbians can be welcoming to visitors, anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread and can be more prevalent around certain anniversaries and some national holidays, including: February 17 (anniversary of Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence), between March 24 and June 10 (the anniversary of the 1999 NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in response to events in Kosovo), and potentially June 28 (St. Vitus’s Day or Vidovdan).

**Sporting Events:** There is the potential for violence before, during, and after sporting events. There have been clashes between police and fans in the vicinity of sports venues, which are often located in residential areas.  The Embassy considers matches between certain teams, including Partizan, Rad, and Red Star, to be high risk events because of violence at previous games.  While U.S. citizens have not been targeted in the past, in a few isolated cases non-Serbians have been the victims of sports-related violence. U.S. Government employees are generally advised to avoid the vicinity of high-profile sporting events.

**Night Clubs:** As a safety precaution due to xenophobic violence, the following clubs have been declared off-limits for U.S. Embassy personnel in Serbia:

* Plastic
* Klub Šlep (Shlep)
* Mr. Stefan Braun

**Crime:**

* Violent crime in Serbia is most often associated with organized crime activities and hooliganism surrounding high-profile sporting events.
* Although not traditionally the targets of violent crime, tourists and visitors should maintain a heightened awareness of their surroundings, as in all major cities.
* Pickpocketing and financial crimes of opportunity are the most common occurrences.
* Tourists should pay attention to taxi meters and listed fares as some taxi drivers may try to scam foreigners and charge higher rates.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Maintain caution if within the vicinity of demonstrations.
* There is often a heavier than usual police presence near demonstrations and traffic may slow or stop until well after the demonstration ends.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime in Serbia, you should contact the local police. Report crimes first to the local police by dialing 192. Remember local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Not all police officers speak English.

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S.-citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the Serbian government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
