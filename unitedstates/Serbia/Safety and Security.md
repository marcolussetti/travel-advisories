# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups, and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists worldwide are using less sophisticated methods of attack. Those include knives, firearms, rudimentary (IEDs) and vehicles to target crowds. They target unprotected or vulnerable venues, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Anti-U.S. Sentiments:**

While Serbians can be welcoming to visitors, anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread. It can be more prevalent around certain anniversaries and some national holidays, such as:

February 17 (anniversary of Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence),

March 24 and June 10 (The 1999 NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, in response to events in Kosovo), and

June 28 (St. Vitus’s Day or Vidovdan).

**Sporting Events:**

There is the potential for violence before, during, and after sporting events.

There have been clashes between police and fans in the vicinity of sports venues. Those venues are often located in residential areas.

Matches between certain teams, including Partizan, Rad, and Red Star, are high risk events. There has been violence at previous games. U.S. citizens have not been targeted in the past. However, in a few isolated cases non-Serbians have been the victims of sports-related violence. U.S. government employees are generally advised to avoid the vicinity of high-profile sporting events.

**Night Clubs:**

As a safety precaution, the following clubs are off-limits for U.S. Embassy personnel due to xenophobic violence:

* Plastic
* Klub Šlep (Shlep)
* Mr. Stefan Braun

**Crime:**

* Violent crime in Serbia is most often associated with organized crime activities and hooliganism surrounding high-profile sporting events.
* Tourists and visitors should be aware of their surroundings, as in all major cities.
* Pickpocketing and financial crimes of opportunity are the most common occurrences.
* Tourists should pay attention to taxi meters and listed fares. as some taxi drivers may try to scam foreigners and charge higher rates.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Past demonstrations have turned violent. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Maintain caution if within the vicinity of demonstrations.
* There is often a heavier than usual police presence near demonstrations. Traffic may slow or stop until well after the demonstration ends.

**International Financial Scams:**

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html)and the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:**

If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime in Serbia, you should contact the local police. Report crimes first to the local police by dialing 192. Remember local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Not all police officers speak English.

**Domestic Violence:**

**Tourism:**

The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities often do not occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the Serbian government. They also may not be recognized by authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically only available in major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to buy medical evacuation insurance.
