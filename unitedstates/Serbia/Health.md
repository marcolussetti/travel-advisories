**Medical Facilities:** Many doctors and other health care providers in Serbia are highly trained. Equipment and hygiene in hospitals, clinics, and ambulances are usually not up to U.S. standards. U.S. name-brand medicines are often unavailable in Serbia. You can get many medicines and basic medical supplies at private pharmacies. Medical facilities require payment in cash for all services, and do not accept U.S. health insurance. Please review our travel tips for [older travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/info-older-travelers.html).

For emergency services in Serbia, dial 193 (fire-fighters), 194 (paramedics), or 987 (roadside assistance).

Ambulance services are not widely available, and training, availability of emergency responders, and ambulance equipment may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medications:**Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Medicines and Medical Devices Agency](https://www.alims.gov.rs/english/) to ensure the medication is legal in Serbia.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/serbia?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Health facilities in general:**

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.
* Some private hospitals may require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry, especially in dentistry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) website for more information on Medical Tourism.
* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.
* In case of malpractice, you may pursue legal remedies using local attorneys.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.

**Non-Traditional Medicine**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Serbia. Homeopathy, herbal remedies, and other non-traditional treatments are practiced in Serbia and promoted as natural alternatives to traditional medicine. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy**

* If you are considering traveling to Serbia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html).
* Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners and Serbians in Serbia.
