# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Roads in Kazakhstan may be in poor repair, especially in rural areas. Signage and lighting on roadways can be poor.

* Potholes are common and are often dangerously deep.
* Mountainous roads, including the highway between Almaty and Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, should be avoided at night or during poor weather.
* Roads outside urban areas are often closed in winter months due to high winds and drifting snow.

**Traffic Laws:** Drivers sometimes disregard traffic signals, ignore lane markings, drive after excessive alcohol consumption (despite official “zero tolerance”), drive into oncoming lanes of traffic, and move at excessive speed – including during adverse weather. Pedestrians sometimes ignore crosswalks and dart in front of cars.

* Visitors should drive defensively at all times, as many local drivers do not follow traffic laws. Road rage can be a problem, and we recommend a non-confrontational response to such behavior.
* Accidents involving severe injury and/or death do occur.
* Traffic police have reportedly stopped cars to extort bribes on city streets and at periodic checkpoints on major highways.

**Public Transportation:**Buses can be crowded and unsafe.

Due to the danger of theft or assault, be selective regarding which taxi you use, and always avoid entering a cab that already contains persons other than the driver. The U.S. Mission highly discourages hailing unlicensed private vehicles on the street and negotiating a fee with the driver on the spot. Ridesharing applications are widely available.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Also, visit the [website of Kazakhstan’s national tourist office](https://www.gov.kz/activities/15805?lang=en) for additional information on road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Kazakhstan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Kazakhstan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa).

Based on assessments conducted by the European Union Aviation Safety Administration, U.S. government personnel traveling on Kazakh airlines must use  Air Astana, Fly Arystan, or SCAT airlines. unless these airlines do not serve the desired destination.
