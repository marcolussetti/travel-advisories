* U.S. travelers may enter Kazakhstan without a visa for stays up to 30 days on each visit and may not stay more than a cumulative 90 days within a six-month period.
* Individuals seeking to stay beyond the 90-day limit within a six-month period may apply for a 10-year Kazakh tourist or business visa. These visas contain restrictions, permitting maximum stays of 60 or 30 days per visit, depending on the type of visa.
* Violating the authorized period of stay in Kazakhstan or engaging in activities inconsistent with your visa category may result in fines, imprisonment, and/or delays upon exit.

If you wish to apply for a permanent residency permit in Kazakhstan, prior to travel you should determine what documentation is required, including criminal background checks, and obtain any necessary authentication for those documents.

* For information about U.S. background checks, refer to the [Federal Bureau of Investigation’s website.](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate)The U.S. Mission in Kazakhstan does not fingerprint U.S. citizens.

**Russian Arrest Warrants:**Kazakhstan and Russia have law enforcement cooperation agreements in place that obligate information sharing on certain security and law enforcement matters. Russian authorities may request that their Kazakh counterparts give increased scrutiny to former and current U.S. government and military personnel with prior work in Russia. Additionally, Russian law enforcement or security services may request that the Kazakh authorities detain U.S. citizens upon entry or exit based on existing mutual assistance agreements.

**HIV/AIDS Entry Restrictions:** Some HIV/AIDS-related restrictions exist for foreign residents and workers in Kazakhstan.

* Visitors who receive a Kazakh work or residency visa must submit a health certification form, including negative HIV test results, with their application to the Migration Police in the city where they intend to work or reside in order to receive a work or residency permit after arriving in Kazakhstan. The results must be less than three months old.
* The city HIV clinic in the place of registration can conduct the test or may certify test results performed abroad.
* If the original test results are in a language other than Russian or Kazakh, they must be accompanied by an official, notarized translation.
