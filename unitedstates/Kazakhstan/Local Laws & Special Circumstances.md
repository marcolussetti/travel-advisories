# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** When traveling to a foreign country, you are subject to that country’s local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

* Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Kazakhstan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* You may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you or if you take pictures of certain buildings or other sensitive infrastructure.
* Kazakh customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning the export of items such as antiques. Please see our [Customs Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/customs.html) page for more information.
* Kazakhstan has a zero-tolerance policy for driving under the influence of alcohol. You can be detained immediately if you are driving under the influence of alcohol.

Furthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Embassy or Consulate immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Faith-Based Travelers:**Visitors to Kazakhstan engaging in missionary work or other religious activities must register with the Local Executive Authority office (Akimat) where the activities will take place. Kazakhstan also imposes restrictions on the importation of religious literature.

You may be fined and deported from Kazakhstan for performing any religious work without proper religious worker registration. Representatives of faith-based non-governmental organizations are considered subject to the registration requirement, even if their activities are not religious in nature.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Kazakhstan; however, these events may be disrupted by local authorities or members of the public. Negative social attitudes towards LGB persons are widespread, and local LGB persons are sometimes subject to physical and verbal abuse, as well as unwanted attention from police. Seeour [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Kazakhstan prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.

**Women Travelers:** Domestic violence is common and sexual assaults do occur, though there have not been recent reports to the Embassy of sexual assault committed against U.S. citizens.
