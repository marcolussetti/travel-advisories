Options for medical care are limited and well below U.S. standards. U.S. citizens often depart Kazakhstan for medical treatment, including many routine procedures. Some prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines are not widely available in Kazakhstan.

For emergency services in Kazakhstan call the Rescue Service by dialing 112. Other provider numbers are: 101 for Fire, 102 for Police, 103 for Emergency Medical Assistance, and 104 in the event of a gas leak.

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country and are unreliable in most areas except in major cities.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/health-care-abroad/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. Doctors and hospitals often expect cash payment for health services.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with [Kazakhstan’s National Center for Expertise](https://nce.kz/en/) to ensure the medication is legal in Kazakhstan.

**Water Quality**

In many areas, tap water does not meet U.S. standards for potability. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested, and ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware. Surface waters (streams, rivers, and ponds) are likely to be contaminated with animal waste. Try to avoid contact with these waters.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality**

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Kazakhstan.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
* For general health information, visit the “[Your Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html)” page.

**Earthquakes**

Kazakhstan is an earthquake-prone country. The U.S. Department of State has ranked the earthquake threat level within the Almaty region in particular as Level 4 (the highest level assigned). Building practices within Kazakhstan do not generally meet U.S. seismic standards. Local authorities do not have sufficient resources to respond to a large-scale disaster.
