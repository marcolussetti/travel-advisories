# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Demonstrations** may occur. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, or on politically significant holidays. They may be accompanied by internet outages, and communications may be disrupted.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.
* Past demonstrations have ended in deaths and mass arrests.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected and/or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**Crime:** The most common crimes encountered by foreign visitors are purse snatching, pickpocketing, assaults, and robberies, although all of these incidents are rare. Be vigilant and do not carry large sums of money or valuables on the street. Financial fraud, such as ATM skimming, is prevalent.

The police sometimes conduct identification checks in public areas. Police are not required to demonstrate probable cause to detain individuals. Upon request, you must produce either a passport or an Embassy or Consulate-certified copy of your passport.

Kazakh security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms and telephones may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.

Harassment and extortion by imposters, genuine law enforcement, and other officials do occur. Never voluntarily give your wallet to anybody. If pressured by a police officer, tell the officer that you will report the behavior to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and to the officer’s supervisors. Try to obtain the officer's name, badge number, and license plate number, and note where and when the incident happened.

Do not use unmarked taxis. At the airport, do not leave with anyone who does not show pre-arranged identification, even if the person is holding a sign with your name.

The [U.S. Mission in Kazakhstan](https://kz.usembassy.gov/) is aware of isolated incidents when foreigners have been drugged, robbed, and physically assaulted at bars and nightclubs as well as in unmarked taxis.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

See our webpage on [help for U.S. victims of crime overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/crime.html) for more information.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

At least 227 people were killed and 9,900 were arrested during the 2022 Kazakh Unrest which is also known as Bloody January. The nationwide demonstration resulted from a sudden sharp increase in liquified pol products.
