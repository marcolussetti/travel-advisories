**We do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. All care providers expect payment in Seychellois Rupees.

Consult the [CDC website for the Seychelles](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/seychelles) prior to travel.  
  
Medical facilities are limited, especially on isolated islands. The main hospital, including accident and emergency services, is in Victoria (telephone: + 248 -4388-000).  
  
Recommendations:

* Carry prescription medication in original packaging.
* Verify with [Seychelles Customs](https://src.gov.sc/customs-and-excises/#Import_and_Export) that your medications are legal before you travel.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html).

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/health/insurance-providers.html) (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
