# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Driving is only practical on the islands of Mahé and Praslin. Roads on both islands are narrow and wind steeply over mountains, often with sheer drops and hairpin bends. Many roads are not well-maintained, have minimal lighting, and many drivers do not necessarily adhere to traffic regulations. Traffic safety is hazardous due to a lack of safety barriers and inadequate street lighting. Avoid remote roads, particularly at night.  Drunk-driving is a problem, so be particularly aware of other road users who may behave recklessly.

**Traffic Laws:** You will need an international driving permit to drive in the Seychelles. Cars drive on the left. Drivers and front-seat passengers are required to wear seatbelts. Car rentals are available. Most car rental companies will include an excess as part of the rental fee, which will cover a certain amount of damage. It is advisable to clarify this with your car rental company, as it may be possible to purchase higher excess amounts.  You may not be able to purchase short-term car insurance with local insurance companies.

**Accidents:** In the event of an automobile accident, remain at the scene until the police arrive.

**Public Transportation:**

**Buses:** Services are infrequent on some routes, tend to be crowded during rush hours, and may require a transfer. On the islands of Mahé and Praslin, buses operate from early morning to early evening. A timetable is available from the bus station in Victoria.

**Taxis:**Negotiate the fare before beginning your journey. Some taxis are not metered, so confirm with your hotel about fares you should expect on trips.

**Ferry/Water Transport:** Most of the inner islands are accessible by boat or ferry; there are also a number of day trips available to tourists. Check that there is sufficient safety equipment including life jackets and ship to shore radio.  Travel by ship to the outer islands including the Amirantes, Cosmoledo and Aldabra groups requires prior approval from the Seychelles Maritime Safety Authority.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of Seychelles’ [national tourist office](http://www.seychelles.travel/) and national authority responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Seychelles, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Seychelles’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:**Mariners planning travel to Seychelles should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at <https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts>. Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website [(https:homeport.uscg.mil](https://homeport.uscg.mil/)), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) broadcast warnings website <https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal>  select “broadcast warnings.”

The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Seychelles ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Seychelles. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Seychelles should exercise increased caution.
