# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Precautions:**

* Keep valuables locked in hotel room safe.
* Be aware of surroundings, especially at night.
* Be alert while driving, especially at night, as there are minimal street lights.
* Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.
* Never swim or snorkel alone.
* Be aware of currents, rip tides, and tide levels as they can change seasonally and/or instantaneously.
* Follow the instructions of local authorities, monitor local news broadcasts, and [consular messages](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmu.usembassy.gov%2Fu-s-citizen-services%2Fsecurity-and-travel-information%2F&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C43aa41d1c0514ebaa0e408daf3d6b9a7%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638090400804011445%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ihQKFFUn5i8R3ntrHUvy946w0GkuOI0Vc6c0tnwKidY%3D&reserved=0).

**Piracy:** Attacks have occurred in coastal waters surrounding the outer islands and, in some cases, farther out at sea. See [MARAD’s](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Seychelles.html#ExternalPopup) page for advisories.

**Marine hazards:** Do not fish, swim, or snorkel alone. Always seek expert local advice about which areas are deemed safe for swimming, as this can differ based on seasonal weather patterns and time of day. Many beaches have varying strong/rip currents.  Most beaches do not have a regular lifeguard presence.

**Crime:** Muggings and petty crime such as purse snatching and pickpocketing are reportedly on the increase and can be a problem especially in and around tourist facilities and ATMs. Theft from vehicles and on beaches or walking trails occurs in areas frequented by foreigners.

See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Seychelles.html#ExternalPopup) pages for information on scams.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Consular Agency and/or the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry has regulations for certain activities, although safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not always be carried out regularly.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified in support of organized activities either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only on the main islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. First responders are generally unable to access more remote islands to provide urgent medical treatment, and emergency facilities and/or medical personnel on individual islands vary, or may not exist at all. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) and verify that operators are licensed prior to engaging their services for special activities.
