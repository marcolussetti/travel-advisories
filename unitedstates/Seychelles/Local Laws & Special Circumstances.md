# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long jail sentences and heavy fines. You may have difficulties at immigration if you are traveling with military clothing or arms/ammunition.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consular Agency or U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Beach wear:**Topless sunbathing is acceptable on certain beaches. Nudism is not permitted.

**Phone Service:** Cellular phones are in widespread use on the main islands, and service is generally adequate, though there are coverage gaps in some remote areas. Local SIM cards can be purchased by tourists to use with a compatible cell phone.

**Currency:**The Seychellois Rupee (SCR) is the currency of the Seychelles. In some instances, tourists can pay for goods and services in U.S. dollars or other hard currency. ATMs are available at the international airport and around the major tourist destinations of Mahe, Praslin and La Digue, but they dispense only Seychellois Rupees. Credit cards are not necessarily widely accepted outside of resorts. Gas stations and smaller, more remote outlets usually only accept cash.
