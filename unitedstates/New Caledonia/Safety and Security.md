**Public Safety:** Marches highlighting labor or political issues take place in the greater Noumea area from time to time. Any protest or demonstration has the potential to turn violent. You should avoid large public demonstrations at all times. Roads leading into and out of Noumea may be closed during periods of civil unrest. Messages regarding demonstrations and strikes, explosive device/suspicious packages, and weather-related events are posted on the embassy’s [website.](https://fj.usembassy.gov/category/alert/)

**Crime:** The crime rate in New Caledonia is low; however, petty crime such as pick pocketing and purse-snatching does occur. Fights and assaults sometimes occur outside discotheques and bars, especially over weekends and holidays and at closing time

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.
