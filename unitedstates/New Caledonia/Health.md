* Medical treatment on the main island is generally good but not up to standards of industrialized countries and it is more limited on the outer islands.
* Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services. Patients with more serious illnesses are often referred to Noumea, Australia, or France for treatment.
* Serious medical conditions requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost thousands of dollars. Doctors and hospitals in New Caledonia often expect immediate cash payment for health services.

**The Department of State does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tuvalu) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.
