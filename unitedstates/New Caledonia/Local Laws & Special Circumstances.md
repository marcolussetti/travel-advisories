# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Do not buy counterfeit and pirated goods in New Caledonia, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, you are breaking local law, too. The import or possession of counterfeit items is a crime in New Caledonia and even having any such items in your baggage on arrival can lead to their seizure and serious fines for the person involved.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Customs:** Customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from New Caledonia of items such as agricultural products. Please contact the [Embassy of France in Washington](https://franceintheus.org/)for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Cyclone Season:**The official cyclone season is November through April. The [Fiji Meteorological Service](https://www.met.gov.fj/) maintains a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Nadi serving the Southwest Pacific Region. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available at the [State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html), as well as from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/)website.
