# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:** Petty theft is common in some parts of Solomon Islands. Guided or group tours are generally safer than traveling alone. Landowners may demand money if you enter their land without permission. Home invasions, burglaries, and violent crime typically increase in the months approaching the Christmas holiday season. Yacht-related robberies can occur, usually at night while occupants are asleep. Most criminals are not deterred even when boats are anchored offshore. Visiting yachts should be wary of allowing strangers onboard and boaters should take precautions when leaving the vessel to go ashore.

**General Safety:** You should travel in groups for safety and security, especially in the evening or at night. All water activities should be done in groups. Swimmers should be aware of saltwater crocodiles that can be found at the mouths of rivers emptying into the sea.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, during international events, or during other cultural events that attract large crowds.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
