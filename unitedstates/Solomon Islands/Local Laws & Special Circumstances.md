# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Local customary law is still observed in Solomon Islands, especially in rural areas. Disputes based in customary law are generally resolved through a compensation-based settlement mediated by law enforcement or local government officials. Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consular Agency immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Customs:** The Solomon Islands' customs authorities enforce strict regulations for importing or exporting firearms and ammunition, pornography, and certain prescription drugs. Other items may be subject to quarantine regulations or import duty. The Solomon Islands' government prohibits the export of military artifacts from World War II. Contact the [Solomon Islands' Mission to the United Nations](https://www.un.int/solomonislands/) for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Unexploded Ordnance:** Unexploded World War II ordnance remains in the Solomon Islands, particularly in the areas of Hell’s Point, the ridges behind Honiara, the New Georgia group of islands, Tulagi, and the Russel Islands. Be alert when hiking, boating, or diving. Be vigilant for ordnance and obey all posted warnings.

**Natural Disasters:** Solomon Islands is subject to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden tidal movements (tsunamis). The Pacific cyclone season extends from November through March.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in the Solomon Islands does not prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. The availability of rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices is extremely limited or non-existent. Service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants may be available. Contact the U.S. Consular Agency in Honiara to receive a list of providers.
