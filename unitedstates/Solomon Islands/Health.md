For emergency services in Solomon Islands, call St. Johns Ambulance service (+677) 38160 or (+677) 73 98566.

Ambulance services are:

* Generally available in Honiara but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* Not present throughout the rest of the country or are unreliable except in Honiara.
* May not be equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* In areas outside Honiara, injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi, private vehicle, water-borne transportation, or private foreign or local air ambulance service to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as medical evacuation to Australia, New Zealand, or the United States can cost thousands of dollars.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Travelers arriving from measles-affected countries must provide proof of measles vaccination administered no less than three weeks prior to arrival in Solomon Islands. For the purposes of this requirement, measles-affected countries include American Samoa, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Philippines. This requirement does not apply to infants under six months of age, pregnant women, or to other travelers with documentary evidence of contraindications to measles vaccine administration.

**Air Quality:** The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:

* Infants, children, and teens
* People over 65 years of age
* People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
* People with heart disease or diabetes
* People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments. Specialized medicines may need to be ordered from Australia and may take weeks to arrive.

Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States.
