# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Traffic in Solomon Islands moves on the left side of the road. Paved roads are found only in and around Honiara. These two-lane paved roads are poorly marked and have many potholes. Roads are not well lit at night. The remaining roads in Solomon Islands are made of coral, gravel, or are dirt tracks.

* Be careful when driving off main roads to avoid trespassing on communal land.
* Vehicles are frequently poorly maintained.
* Traffic jams are common in Honiara.
* Pedestrians often walk on the roads and may not consider vehicle traffic.
* Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe driving practices.

**Traffic Laws:** If you are involved in a road accident, local law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. If a crowd gathers after an accident and you feel threatened, proceed directly to a police station. Incidents of individuals being harmed by crowds as a result of a traffic accident are rare.

Most local drivers are not well trained and do not follow basic traffic laws. Be aware of drivers under the influence of alcohol, of pedestrians who are not aware of traffic, and of children running out into the road. Police control of traffic is limited, even in Honiara. When driving be alert at all times. Street signs and traffic lights are scarce or may not be in working order.

**Public Transportation:** Taxi services in Honiara and Auki are widely available and are generally safe. Public bus and mini-bus services are also available, but safety standards may vary widely and information on routes may not be available in a published form. Incidences of petty theft are more frequent on public transportation. While greater government regulation and oversight has led to an increase in safety of ferry services, be aware that safety standards may still vary widely and amenities onboard are often extremely limited.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in the Solomon Islands, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Solomon Islands’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).
