[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

The Government of The Gambia requires visitors to obtain a visa prior to or upon entering the country. The fee for a Gambian visa issued through the Gambian Embassy in the United States is currently $200 but is subject to change.  Alternatively, tourists can apply for a visa upon arrival in The Gambia. Tourists are typically granted a 30-day stay in The Gambia upon arrival. The fee for this visa on arrival is currently $108 but is subject to change. You must have at least one blank page in your passport for the stamp. Travelers who stay beyond the allowed time are fined $15 per month of overstay, payable in cash at the airport upon departure. Extensions to stays can be requested at the Department of Immigration in Banjul.

Visit the [Embassy of The Gambia in Washington DC’s](https://gambiaembassydc.gm/) website for the most current visa information. However, please note that the Embassy of The Gambia’s website is frequently not functioning and current information on visas may be difficult to find.

Travelers entering and exiting The Gambia are required to pay a $20 security fee upon arrival and departure at the airport, payable in cash (USD or dalasi) only at kiosks.

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of The Gambia.
