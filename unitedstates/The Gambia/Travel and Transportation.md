# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Road conditions are poor, particularly during the rainy season, which generally lasts from July through September. Although main roads are paved in the greater Banjul area, many are potholed and poorly lit. Some drivers in the Banjul area do not use vehicle lights at night, while others habitually drive with high beams on. Side roads in the Banjul area and most roads outside the Banjul area are unlit and unpaved. Livestock and pedestrians pose road hazards throughout the country, including in the greater Banjul area.

**Traffic Laws:** Numerous accidents are caused by intoxicated drivers. You may be substantially fined or imprisoned if you cause an accident while intoxicated.

The police do not consistently apply traffic laws and regulations, and sometimes compel drivers to pay fines on the spot for violations, real or contrived. Written citations/tickets are rarely given.

Police periodically set up impromptu traffic stops on major streets to check for drivers’ licenses and proper insurance. You are obligated to stop at all roadblocks or road checkpoints. Do not reverse direction to avoid a road checkpoint or make any movements that security personnel may view as suspicious or provocative.

Government convoys pose serious risks to drivers and pedestrians. Government convoys frequently travel at high speeds and often in either or both lanes of traffic, including in the oncoming traffic lane and do not always use sirens to announce their presence.

* Pull to the side of the road as far as possible.
* Do not attempt to move until the entire convoy has passed.
* Failure to comply may result in vehicle damage and/or personal injury.

**Public Transportation:** Exercise caution when using taxis, particularly at night. Most taxis lack safety belts and many are not road-worthy.

Water transportation, including government ferries, is unsafe and unreliable. Ferries, which usually lack sufficient numbers of life preservers for all passengers, are often overcrowded. It is highly recommended that you exit your vehicle quickly after parking to avoid becoming trapped inside for the duration of the crossing. However, this is not always possible, increasing the safety risk. The wooden dugout “pirogues” that also cross the Gambia River often leave shore overloaded.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information. Visit the website of The Gambia’s [national](http://www.visitthegambia.gm/) tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in The Gambia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of The Gambia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to The Gambia should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).

**Port Security:** The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in The Gambia ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in The Gambia. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of The Gambia should exercise increased caution.
