For emergency services in The Gambia, dial **117**.

Ambulance services are unreliable in most areas, including in the immediate capital region.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments and individuals must then seek reimbursement. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of The Gambia, via the nearest embassy or consulate, to ensure the medication is legal.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The government of the Gambia does not require vaccines for citizens of the United States unless they are arriving in the Gambia from a yellow fever zone. Visit the U.S Centers for Disease Control’s website to review their recommendations for [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) for travelers to the Gambia.

* Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality**

* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst during harmattan, between the months of January and April.People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
  + People with heart disease or diabetes
  + People who work or are active outdoors

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in The Gambia.
