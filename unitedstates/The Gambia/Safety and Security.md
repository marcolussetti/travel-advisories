# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Avoid the areas of southern Gambia which border the [Casamance region in Senegal](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Senegal.html), due to potential landmines.

**Crime:** Petty street crime is common. Beware of pickpocketing, purse/bag-snatching, phone-snatching, and theft from vehicles. These crimes occur on ferries, on the beach, in markets and other commercial areas, and in hotels. Ensure that your travel documents, luggage, and valuable items are secure.

Beware of “bumsters” - local men who approach tourists, particularly on beaches and tourist zones, offering help, to act as local guides or to enter into a relationship. They will often demand payment for their services, even if no agreement has been made. Be polite but firm in turning down unwanted help or attempts at conversation.

Avoid walking alone, including on beaches, in tourist areas, and after dark.

Do not display cash and valuable personal property.

Drive with doors locked and windows closed or rolled up enough at all times to prevent theft while stopped in traffic.

**Demonstrations:** Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams**: See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

**Relationship fraud/scams:** Internet and in-person friendship, romance and financial scams are prevalent in The Gambia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails, letters, WhatApp, texts, and/or contact initiated in person. Scammers sometimes pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help, others ask for assistance to help them and family members in need. They request financial assistance from victims to help pay for potentially fraudulent or potentially partially valid claims, such as for urgent medical treatment, school fees for numerous relatives, rent payments, car repair, payment of exit taxes, or government fines.

Do not send money to anyone you have not met in person and whose situation you cannot independently verify.

If you believe you might be a victim of an internet or similar scam, it is strongly recommended that you send no money nor gifts and completely disengage from all contact with the individual(s).

See [Internet Dating and Romance Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html).

**Business fraud/scams:**The U.S. Embassy receives reports of scams in which U.S. businesses sent payment, but did not receive shipments.

Be suspicious of any unsolicited offers to participate in lucrative business opportunities, especially if they require financial disclosures, money transfers, large up-front investments, or promises of confidentiality.

Carefully scrutinize all proposals before you commit any funds, provide any goods or services, or undertake any travel.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in addition to Gambian police. Sexual assaults by relatives are often seen by police as family matters outside their jurisdiction and they may not investigate.

Report crimes to the local police at 117 for police assistance or ambulatory services, and 118 for fire and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(220) 439-2856. The Gambian Police Force operates a 24 hour emergency line at (220) 422-4914. Please be advised that emergency responders may lack fuel for vehicles or face other resource challenges.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** Outside of primary tourist areas in the immediate capital region, formal tourism industry infrastructure is minimal or nonexistent. The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is moderate to minimal in the immediate capital region, and limited to unavailable in much of the rest of the country. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase private [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
