***Updated to reflect new health information.***

Exercise increased caution in Sierra Leone due to **crime**, **civil unrest**, and **limited circulation of** **poliovirus**.

**Country Summary:**Violent crimes, such as robbery and assault, occur frequently in Sierra Leone, especially in Freetown.  Local police often lack the resources to deal effectively with serious criminal incidents.

**Demonstrations** and **protests** occur in Sierra Leone and occasionally result in violence.

If traveling outside the Freetown peninsula, make all efforts to complete your travel before nightfall.  There are increased safety hazards and security concerns at night.  U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission authority are restricted from traveling outside the capital after dark and are unable to provide emergency services outside of Freetown at night.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level Two Travel Health Notice for circulating [Poliovirus in Sierra Leone](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/global-polio).
