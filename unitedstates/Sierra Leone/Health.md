Medical facilities and services in Sierra Leone are severely limited. The standard of care, including basic medical services such as imaging or blood tests, is much lower than in the United States.

For emergency services in Sierra Leone, dial 117.

Ambulance services are limited in availability and for the most part do not meet U.S. standards. They are often unreliable or absent in many areas, typically lacking trained paramedics and adequate medical equipment. As a result, seriously ill or injured travelers might choose to use a taxi or private vehicle to reach a hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance.

See our [Health Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) page for more information.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health website. This website reviews important vaccine recommendations as well as other important guidance to help prevent non-vaccine preventable disease as well as other health and safety tips. Select your destination in the CDC [Travelers’ Health website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/sierra-leone?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) and be sure to review all sub-sections thoroughly.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.**Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Sierra Leone’s Federal Office of Public Health](https://dhse.gov.sl/) to ensure the medication is legal in Sierra Leone.

**Air Quality:**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Sierra Leone. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.
* The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season between December and February. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens
  + People over 65 years of age
  + People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
  + People with heart disease or diabetes

**Water Quality:**

* Generally, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages in sealed containers are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Altitude:**

* Many cities in Sierra Leone, such as Kabala, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.

To prevent mosquito bites, particularly from the anopheles mosquito that carries malaria:

* Avoid outdoor activities at night when possible.
* Sleep under a “tucked in” or floor-length insecticide-treated mosquito net.
* Wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants when outdoors at night.
* Apply insect repellent, such as DEET (25-50%), Picardin (20%) or Oil or Lemon Eucalyptus (30%).
* Use Permethrin to treat clothing, patio furniture, curtains, and mosquito nets.
* Eliminate standing water around your home to prevent mosquito breeding.
