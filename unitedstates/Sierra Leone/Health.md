Please visit the Embassy’s COVID-19 page for more information about COVID-19 in Sierra Leone.

Medical facilities and services in Sierra Leone are severely limited. The standard of care, including basic medical services such as imaging or blood tests, is much lower than that of the United States.

For emergency services in Sierra Leone, dial 117.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.

Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Sierra Leone’s Federal Office of Public Health](https://dhse.gov.sl/) to ensure the medication is legal in Sierra Leone.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
