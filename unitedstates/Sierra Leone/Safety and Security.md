# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Areas outside Freetown lack basic services. U.S. government employees working in Sierra Leone are prohibited from travelling outside the capital after dark. Emergency response to vehicular and other accidents ranges from slow to nonexistent.

**Crime:**Crime is widespread in Sierra Leone. U.S. citizens have experienced armed mugging, assault, and burglary. Petty crime and pick pocketing of wallets, cell phones, and passports are very common, especially on the ferry to and from Lungi International Airport, as well as in bars, restaurants, and nightclubs in the Lumley Beach and Aberdeen areas of Freetown.

**Demonstrations** occur periodically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.ic3.gov/) pages for information on scams.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sierra Leone. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings or profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:**U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy at (232) (99) 105 500. Report crimes to the local police at (232) (76) 692 830.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities in the field. If you are injured, you will likely find medical treatment only in or near major cities and there are few medical specialists in country able to treat complicated medical conditions. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.
