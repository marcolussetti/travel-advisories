# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Areas outside Freetown lack basic services. Travel outside the capital after dark is not allowed for U.S. Embassy officials and should be avoided by all travelers. Emergency response to vehicular and other accidents ranges from slow to nonexistent.

**Crime:** Crime is widespread in Sierra Leone. U.S. citizens have experienced armed mugging, assault, and burglary. Petty crime and pick pocketing of wallets, cell phones, and passports are very common, especially on the ferry to and from Lungi International Airport, as well as in bars, restaurants, and nightclubs in the Lumley Beach and Aberdeen areas of Freetown.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information on scams.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sierra Leone. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings or profiles, or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy at (232) (99) 105 500. Report crimes to the local police at (232) (76) 692 830.

Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities and there are few medical specialists in country able to treat complicated medical conditions. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and are not trained to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
