# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Most main roads in Freetown are navigable, but many are narrow and often have potholes. There is limited roadside assistance in-country, and it is often difficult to find adequate fuel for longer journeys. Serious accidents are common, especially outside of Freetown, where the relative lack of traffic allows for greater speeds. You should avoid nighttime travel.

**Traffic Laws:**International road signs and protocols are not routinely observed in Sierra Leone. In the event of a traffic accident, you should follow all police instructions. Large mobs often form at the scene of an accident and threaten the safety of the driver. You should go to the nearest police station for safety, even in minor accidents.

**Public Transportation:**Public transport (bus or group taxi) is erratic, unsafe, and not recommended. U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from using public transportation or taxis.

Motorcycle taxis are ubiquitous in Freetown and often cause serious accidents. The U.S. Embassy strongly advises against utilizing these motorcycles. Pick pocketing is common in public taxis and mini-buses.
