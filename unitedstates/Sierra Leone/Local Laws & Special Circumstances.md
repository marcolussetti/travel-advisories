# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you may be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that requires special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Exports:**Sierra Leone's customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning the export of gems and precious minerals, such as diamonds and gold. All mineral resources, including gold and diamonds, belong to the State, and only the Government of Sierra Leone can issue mining and export licenses. The National Minerals Agency (NMA) can provide licenses for export, while the agency’s Directorate of Precious Minerals Trading is responsible for Kimberly Process certification of diamonds. For further information on mining activities in Sierra Leone, contact the [Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources](https://www.nma.gov.sl/), or see the [Department of State’s annual Investment Climate Statement](https://www.state.gov/investment-climate-statements/).

The Embassy has received reports in recent years of U.S. citizens investing in Sierra Leone who have been victims of fraud, often in the mining industry. Examples of fraud include advance-fee schemes where individuals have approached U.S. citizens urging them to purchase diamonds directly from Sierra Leone. The U.S. Embassy cannot interfere or intervene in any legal disputes, including those related to precious minerals. See a list of types of export/investment assistance available from the U.S. Commercial Service [here](https://www.trade.gov/all-services). You may also contact Freetown-Econ@state.gov.

**Photography:**Travelers must obtain official permission to photograph government buildings, airports, bridges, or official facilities including the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the U.S. Embassy.

**Dual Nationals:**U.S. citizens who are also Sierra Leonean nationals must provide proof of payment of taxes on revenue earned in Sierra Leone before being granted clearance to depart the country.

**LGB Travelers:**Consensual sexual relations between men are criminalized in Sierra Leone. Although the U.S. Embassy is not aware of any recent prosecutions for consensual sexual activity between men, such activity is illegal and penalties can include imprisonment. While there is no explicit legal prohibition against sexual relations between women, women of all ages can be victims of “planned rapes” initiated by family members in an effort to change their sexual orientation.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Sierra Leone does not prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities and offers no specific protections for such persons. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure throughout the country. Rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, and service providers, such as sign language interpreters, are not available.

**Students:**See our [Students Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/students.html) page and [FBI travel tips.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure)

**Women Travelers:**Rape, including spousal rape, is illegal in Sierra Leone and punishable by up to 15 years in prison. However, rape is common and indictments are rare. Domestic violence is illegal and punishable by a fine of up to five million leones ($943) and up to two years in prison. However, domestic violence is common and police are unlikely to intervene.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is less widespread in Sierra Leone now than in the past. The government’s focus is on protecting minor girls from the practice. While technically criminalized, the government will not try to stop FGM/C for consenting adults due to the deep-seated traditions, particularly in rural areas.
