# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: Main roads in major cities are generally paved and well-maintained. Secondary roads and many roads outside of major cities are mostly in poor condition. Many accidents occur on the highway from Accra to Cape Coast. Travel in darkness, particularly outside the major cities, is extremely hazardous due to poor street lighting and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. Aggressive drivers, poorly maintained vehicles, and overloaded vehicles pose serious threats to road safety.

Scammers may intentionally bump into vehicles and pretend to be hit. They then attempt to extort money from the vehicle’s occupants. Scams of this nature most commonly occur in congested urban areas.

There has been an increase in robberies on the highways from Bole-to-Wa and Kintampo-to-Tamale, as well as on other minor roads within parts of the Upper West, Upper East, Northern, Eastern, Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo Regions. Embassy personnel are not permitted to travel at night outside of major cities, and are encouraged to avoid the areas listed in our [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ghana-travel-advisory.html). Remain vigilant, and drive with doors locked and windows up.

**Traffic Laws**: Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints throughout Ghana, and vehicles and passengers may be searched. Drivers must possess an international driver’s license (available from [AAA](https://cluballiance.aaa.com/MemberNonMemberLanding) and the [American Automobile Touring Alliance](http://aataidp.com/)) or a Ghanaian driver’s license. When foreign drivers apply for their Ghanaian driver’s license, they may be asked to have their international driver’s license or their home country driver’s license confirmed by their embassy. The U.S. Embassy in Ghana is unable to authenticate such state-issued or international drivers’ licenses, and advises U.S. citizens to contact the [National Identification Authority in Ghana](https://nia.gov.gh/) or have their U.S. driver’s license authenticated in the United States prior to arriving in Ghana. While in Ghana, you should carry documentation of your immigration status, such as a passport and a visa.

**Public Transportation**: Safety standards for small private buses, often called tro-tros, are substandard.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information. Visit the website of [Ghana’s national tourist office](https://visitghana.com/) and national authority responsible for road safety.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Ghana’s Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Ghana’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

Due to safety concerns, Ghana Civil Aviation Authority prohibits transporting via air carrier any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone device.

**Maritime Travel**: Mariners planning travel to Ghana should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
