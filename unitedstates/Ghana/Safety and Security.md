West Africa faces an increased threat from transnational terrorist groups. Terrorists have targeted Westerners in Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, and Mali.

**Crime:**  Violent crimes, such as armed robbery and kidnapping, occasionally occur. Robberies on highways are of particular concern, especially at night. Armed robbers also sometimes target vehicles coming from Kotoka International Airport. If your car is hit by another car while you are driving, go directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Reports of residential robberies continue to be on the rise.

Street crime remains a serious problem in Accra and other large cities. Thieves carry out crimes of opportunity, such as “snatch & grabs,” on city streets in isolated areas as well as from vehicles idling in traffic. Pickpockets are also prevalent in crowded areas.

Luggage and travel document theft occurs at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across Ghana. Keep your documents secure at all times, and don’t leave your baggage unattended. Be wary of all offers of unsolicited assistance at the airport from anyone other than uniformed porters or officials.

Credit card fraud is common. Exercise caution when using credit and ATM cards in Ghana. It is very common for scammers to tamper with credit card terminals. Skimming is the primary means of credit card fraud, and is undetectable until fraudulent charges appear on statements. If you choose to use a credit card anywhere in Ghana, monitor your credit card activity closely.

There are a number of ongoing chieftaincy disputes in Ghana that generally involve competition over limited resources. Several of these disputes have erupted into violence and unrest during recent years. Exercise caution in rural areas and remain alert to outbreaks of unrest. Please see the Travel & Transportation section for more information.

For further information about crime trends in Ghana, the Ghana Police Service Criminal Investigations Department issues advisories on the [Ghana Police Service site](http://police.gov.gh/en/).

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Ghana. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/relative targeting
* Free trip/luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated outside of the major cities, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to easily access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html "Insurance Providers for Overseas Coverage").

**Maritime Security**: Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.
