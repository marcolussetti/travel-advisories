Updated to reflect threats against LGB travelers.

Exercise increased caution in Ghana due to **crime** and **violence against members of the LGB community**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Exercise increased caution in:

* Parts of the Bono East, Bono, Savannah, Northern, North East, and Upper East regions due to **civil unrest.**

**Country summary:**Violent crimes, such as carjacking and street mugging, do occur. These crimes often happen at night and in isolated locations. Exercise increased caution specifically due to crime:

* In urban areas and crowded markets
* When traveling by private or public transportation after dark as criminal elements may use blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles
* In areas near the northern border in the Upper East and Upper West regions

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.

**LGB Travelers:** Ghanaian law contains prohibitions on “unlawful carnal knowledge” – generally interpreted as any kind of sexual intimacy – between persons of the same sex. Punishments can include fines and/or incarceration. Anti-LGB rhetoric and violence have increased in recent years. Members of the LGB community have reported safety incidents that include targeted assault, rape, mob attacks, and harassment due to their identity.

**Areas Near the Northern Border in the Upper East and Upper West Regions – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**

U.S. citizens traveling in Ghana should exercise caution while visiting border areas, in particular the northern border, and be sure to read [Security Alerts](https://gh.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/) affecting those areas. Due to security concerns over criminal activity in remote areas, travel of U.S. government personnel to the northern and northwestern border is currently limited.
