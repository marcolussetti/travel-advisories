# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Traffic Safety:** Road conditions are generally excellent, but traffic engineering and driving habits pose special dangers.

* Lane markings and sign placements may differ from those in the United States. Drivers should be prepared to make last-minute maneuvers and stops.
* Be aware that pedestrians, bikers, and trams generally have the right-of-way.
* In alpine areas roads may become dangerous due to snowfall, ice, or avalanches. Some mountain roads may close for extended periods.
* In some mountain areas, vehicle snow chains are required in the winter.

**Accidents:** In the event of a traffic accident, call the police immediately at 117. Call 118 for the fire department and 144 for medical/ambulance services.

**Toll roads:** If you plan to drive to Liechtenstein via Austrian or Swiss motorways you must purchase a Swiss or Austrian toll sticker (vignette), which must be affixed to the car’s windshield. These are available online, at gas stations, and at border crossings. Failure to comply with traffic rules can result in large fines. For more information visit the website of the [Swiss Federal Customs Administration](https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/documents-for-travellers-and-road-taxes/motorway-charge-sticker--vignette-.html) and the [Austrian Motorway Operator (ASFiNAG)](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Traffic Laws and Fines:** While driving in Switzerland you are subject to local traffic laws.

* The minimum age to operate a motor vehicle in Liechtenstein is 18.
* All vehicles are required to travel with their headlights on at all times.
* Use of cellular telephones for talking or texting while driving is prohibited.
* Right-of-way rules differ from those in the United States. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, drivers entering intersections from the right have priority over those on the left, even when entering relatively large boulevards from small side streets.
* Turning right on red is illegal.

**Public Transportation:** Public transport in Liechtenstein is excellent, punctual, and safe. There is an extensive bus network that connects the capital, Vaduz with the bus and railway stations in Switzerland and Austria.

The websites’ of the [National Tourist Office of Liechtenstein](https://tourismus.li/en/our-country/arrival-transport/) and the [Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)](https://www.sbb.ch/en/) are the best places to obtain information on fares and timetables.

* **Travelers must purchase tickets and** **validate them by punching them in validating machines *prior* to boarding**a bus. Failure to follow this procedure may result in an **on-the-spot fine** by an inspector. If the violator does not pay the fine on the spot, it will automatically double.
* Be aware of pick-pockets and do not leave bags unattended. Most reported thefts occur on public buses, trams and trains, and at the major railway stations.
