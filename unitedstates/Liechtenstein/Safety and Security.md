# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

**The local equivalent to the “911” emergency number in Europe, including Liechtenstein, is “112.**” You can also directly dial 144 for medical emergencies, 117 for the police, and 118 for the fire department.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Monitor media and local information sources as well as Embassy Bern’s [safety and security webpage](https://ch.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/), and factor updated information into personal travel plans and activities.
* Address specific safety concerns to law enforcement authorities in Liechtenstein.

**Crime:** The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing, vehicle break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft.

* **Do not leave bags unattended.** Most reported thefts occur at crowded tourist sites, at airports, car rental agencies, on public buses, trams and trains, and at the major railway stations.
* Visitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings.
* Be alert to criminal schemes. Organized groups of pick-pockets operate at major tourist sites and when conferences, festivals, shows, or exhibitions occur. Thieves frequently work in pairs. For example, one member of the pair creates a disturbance while the other steals your belongings.
* While the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur. See our travel tips for [Women Travelers](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/women-travelers.html).

**Victims of Crime:** Report crimes to the local police at 117, and contact the U.S. Embassy at +41 31 357-7011. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.

**Alpine hazards:** Liechtenstein is a popular destination for outdoor sports enthusiasts, including skiing, hiking, and mountain climbing. Alpine hazards such as avalanches and snowdrifts, landslides and flooding, glacial crevasses, falling rocks, sun exposure, and sudden weather changes are common year-round. Although safety standards are excellent, visitors need to be aware that public safety warnings are not comparable to those found in the United States. While hiking paths and ski slopes are clearly marked, not all possibly hazardous situations will have clear warning signs. People are expected to use common sense and caution when enjoying the outdoors.

People should:

* Stay on designated paths or slopes
* Follow the advice given by local authorities and guides
* Take note of weather forecasts and conditions
* Be in a team of two when participating in mountain activities
* Inform someone of your plans and anticipated time of return

Mountain rescues can be extremely expensive and we recommend that you have sufficient **insurance coverage** that includes coverage for **mountain search and rescue.** See our website for more information on [overseas insurance coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).The non-profit foundation [Swiss Air Rescue Organization (REGA)](https://www.rega.ch/en/) offers a membership that waives the costs of rescue missions; many Liechtenstein citizens are members and U.S. citizens are able to join as well.

You may wish to download the [AlertSwiss App](https://www.alert.swiss/en/app.html) provided by the Swiss Federal Government and receive information, alerts and warnings in real time.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. Local organizations offer counseling and [assistance for victims of crime](https://www.llv.li/inhalt/11484/amtsstellen/opferhilfestelle).

**International Financial Scams:** See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
