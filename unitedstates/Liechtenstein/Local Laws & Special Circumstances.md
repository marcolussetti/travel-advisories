# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Banking:** Most major credit cards are widely accepted, but many vendors will only accept chip-and-PIN cards. ATMs are widely available and accept U.S. debit cards. Please see the [Embassy’s website](https://ch.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/living-in-ch/banking-resources/) for more information on banking.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex relationships or the organization of LGB events in Liechtenstein.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:** While in Switzerland, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Many sidewalks are narrow and uneven, and cobblestone streets can make access difficult, but most major tourist areas have better facilities. Please see the website of the [Liechtenstein National Tourist Office](https://tourismus.li/en/) or the website of the [Swiss National Tourist Office](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/planning/transport-accommodation/guests-with-special-needs/) for more information.
