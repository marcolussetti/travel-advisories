For emergency services in Liechtenstein dial 144, or 117 for police.

**Medical care** is comparable to that found in the United States. Ambulance services are widely available.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Swiss medical facilities and care providers will ask for you to settle your bills onsite and you will have to claim a refund with your insurer later. It is common for hospitals to ask for a deposit to ensure medical costs will be covered.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on types of overseas insurance. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

**Medications:** Over-the-counter medicine is available at pharmacies and a pharmacist is on call 24/7. Information regarding the pharmacy and pharmacist on duty in your area can be obtained over the medical emergency telephone line by dialing 144. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [Swiss Federal Customs Administration](https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/bans--restrictions-and-authorisations/medicines--medicinal-products--and-doping.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Switzerland or Liechtenstein. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)** is common. Travelers planning high-risk activities (camping, adventure travel) should take precautions. See the website of the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/tickborne-encephalitis) for more details on TBE and TBE prevention.

**Air Quality:**Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
