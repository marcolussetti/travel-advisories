# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:** U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport at time of entry.

**NOTE:** Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as proof of anticipated departure from the country. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.

**HIV/AIDS:**The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
