Medical facilities in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines do not meet U.S. standards. There is no hyperbaric chamber, and divers requiring treatment for decompression illness must be evacuated from the island.

We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuations.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines](https://www.gov.vc/) to ensure the medication is legal in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
