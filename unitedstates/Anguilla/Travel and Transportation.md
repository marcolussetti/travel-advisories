**Road Conditions and Safety:**Be careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads on foot. Major roads are in average to poor condition. Drivers often stop in the middle of the roadway without warning.

Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and watch for signs of sudden braking. Automobiles may lack working safety and signaling devices.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving is on the left-hand side of the road.
