Medical facilities in Anguilla do not meet U.S. standards.

**The U.S. government does not pay medical bills for overseas travelers.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not apply overseas. Doctors and hospitals will expect immediate cash payment for health services.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [Anguilla](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Anguilla.html#ExternalPopup) to ensure the medication is legal in Anguilla.Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
