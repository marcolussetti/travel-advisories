[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and visa:**U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport at time of entry. There are no visa requirements if you have an onward or return ticket, confirmation of accommodation, and can produce evidence of your ability to maintain yourself.Visit the [U.K. Embassy website](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/anguilla) for the most current visa information.

Generally, all U.S. citizens are required to present a valid U.S. passport when traveling to Anguilla, as well as proof of anticipated departure from Anguilla. This includes travelers arriving by airplane and by private sea-going vessel. Those traveling to Anguilla on a cruise may use another Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend visitors obtain a passport before travel in case of an unforeseen emergency that requires a cruise passenger to disembark and return by air.

**HIV/AIDS:** The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Anguilla.
