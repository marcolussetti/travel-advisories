# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

Omani authorities typically do not permit foreigners accused of crimes to leave the country while cases are open.

Carry your passport at all times, or you could be detained.

It is illegal to photograph certain buildings.

**Alcohol and Drugs:** You may be arrested for possession of alcohol or driving under the influence. Drinking is only permitted in some international hotels, bars, homes, and some restaurants.

Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs include lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines.  Some prescription medications, such as narcotics, available in the United States may be illegal in Oman. Travelers should check the Oman Ministry of Health’s [Medications and Travel](https://www.moh.gov.om/en/-/---276) webpage before importing prescription medications.

**Motor Vehicle Violations:** Traffic laws are strictly enforced and carry heavy penalties. Remote traffic cameras are extensively used to monitor speeding and stop light infractions.

Immigration officials, airports and other ports of entry and exit have ready access to information on traffic offenses, and violators cannot depart Oman unless all fines have been paid in full.

**Personal Defamation Charges:**

* Using vulgar language or hand gestures can lead to personal defamation charges.
* An accusation alone, regardless of who files it, can initiate a legal process.
* U.S. citizens may be able to resolve these cases with a formal apology and payment of damages to the aggrieved party.
* Raising your voice at local authorities in Oman can result in detainment.

**Business Disputes:** Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may prohibit your departure from Oman until the issue is resolved. The U.S. Embassy is unable to intervene in civil cases but can provide a list of local attorneys who may be able to represent U.S. citizens. In Oman it is not uncommon for local authorities to maintain your passport while a business dispute is under investigation.

Issues can include:

* Labor or financial disputes
* Personal debt (including bounced checks, credit card debt, and bank loans)
* Outstanding contracts or leases
* Traffic fines
* Pending legal matters, including cases related to gestures or behavior that are viewed as offensive.

**Cultural Heritage Items:** To avoid prosecution, check first with Omani authorities before taking “cultural heritage items” such as archaeological artifacts, meteorites, or stones.

**Notary Services:** All foreign public documents (Birth, Marriage, Death, Divorce, academic records, etc.) need to be apostilled for use in Oman. The U.S. Embassy in Oman cannot apostille any documents issued in the United States. See [our website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/internl-judicial-asst/authentications-and-apostilles/office-of-authentications.html) for designated authorities in the United States that can issue an apostille.

**Employment in Oman:** Although a common practice, it is illegal for Omani employers to retain your passport. Such retention could grant undue leverage to your employer in case of a dispute. U.S. passports are the property of the U.S. government.

The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene in labor disputes. At the beginning of any employment, obtain a contract that clearly states the terms of employment. Try to resolve disputes privately with your employer. If this fails, consult our [list of lawyers.](https://om.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/153/2025/05/Attorney-List-May-2025.pdf)

**Dress Code:** Be sensitive to Islamic culture and do not wear sleeveless shirts, halter-tops, or shorts. Wear athletic clothing in public only when engaged in sports activities.

**Currency**: U.S. bills printed before 2006 are often not accepted. Local currency is easily available from ATMs or currency exchange counters.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** See our following webpages for details:

**Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Travelers:** Consensual same-sex sexual conduct is criminalized in Oman and subject to a jail term of six months to three years. While there are no legal restrictions on providing information or services related to sexual orientation, stigma remains high in the country. Authorities have taken steps to block media content related to sexual orientation. See our [Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Travelers Information page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Oman prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual, or mental disabilities.  Expect accessibility to be limited in older buildings (including government buildings and schools), public transportation, and general infrastructure, and more common in newer medical facilities and public buildings in cities. Outside of urban areas, access is greatly reduced.  Accessible parking spaces are scarce.

Omanis will generally try to accommodate reasonable requests for assistance.
