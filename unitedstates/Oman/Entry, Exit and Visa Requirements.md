# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visit the [Embassy of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/washington/) website for the most current visa information.

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport valid for at least six months
* Visa

**Tourist Visas:**

* U.S. citizens should apply for tourist visas in advance via the [Royal Oman Police E-Visa website](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/visaservices_mainpage.html). Tourist visas are also available upon arrival at airports and land crossings.
* Visas are issued at Mazoonah and Sarfait (Oman-Yemen land borders) on a case-by-case basis.
* The current list of visa types and a schedule of fees are available at the [Royal Oman Police website](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/visaservices_mainpage.html).
* Have proof of adequate funds and an onward/return ticket.
* Penalties for expired passports or visas include fines and/or imprisonment.

**Avoid Travel to Yemen:** We strongly advise U.S. citizens against travel to Yemen. Crossing the Yemen-Oman border can be dangerous. U.S. citizens who do so are routinely detained by Omani authorities. The Department of State and U.S. embassies abroad will not facilitate entry of U.S. citizens into Yemen. See our [Travel Advisory for Yemen](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html)for further information.

Oman does not recognize dual nationality. Omani authorities may confiscate your U.S. passport if you have dual Oman/U.S. nationality. Should this happen, contact the U.S. Embassy. This does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship.

Children of Omani fathers automatically acquire Omani citizenship at birth and must enter and exit Oman on their Omani passports.

Omani/U.S. dual nationals are subject to all Omani laws, including those placing special obligations on citizens of Oman.

Expect considerable delays if your U.S. passport is lost or stolen. The Royal Oman Police require entry verification upon departure. If your passport containing your entry stamp is lost or stolen, a police report may be required to exit Oman using a replacement passport. For further details, see the [Royal Oman Police website](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/visaservices_mainpage.html).

Yellow fever vaccinations are required if you are coming from a country with yellow fever outbreaks.

Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Oman. HIV/AIDS testing is required upon arrival for people on work or immigrant visas. Oman does not accept U.S. HIV/AIDS testing. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of Oman](https://fm.gov.om/washington/)before traveling.

**Customs Regulations:**

* Pornographic materials and firearms are prohibited.
* Muslim travelers are forbidden to bring in alcohol. Oman does not require visitors to identify with a religion.
* Non-Muslim travelers can bring in no more than two liters of alcohol bought at a duty-free shop.
