**COVID-19 Testing**

For general PCR testing and exiting Oman, various health clinics in Oman offer PCR tests with results within 72 hours as well as 24-hour and 3–6-hour options.  PCR tests are at the expense of the individual/traveler.  Prices vary by clinic and range from 20 – 40 OMR; surcharges often apply for expedited result processing within 24 hours or less.  Drive up testing, walk-in tests, and tests by appointment are all available in Oman.  Test result delivery varies by clinic: e-mail, text, and physical message are commonly used to communicate results.

**COVID-19 Vaccines**

The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Oman. Please refer to the [Omani Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.om/en/home) for additional information on vaccination registration.

Visit the FDA's website to learn more about [FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) in the United States.

For emergency services in Oman, dial 9999.  Emergency hotlines are mostly Arabic-speaking.  The U.S. Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens who were unable to receive assistance due to language barriers.

Response times for ambulance services vary.  Injured or seriously ill travelers should take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

Modern medical facilities and Western-style pharmacies are available. Local medical treatment varies from average to inadequate, depending on location.

Hospital emergency treatment is available.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Oman to ensure the medication is legal in Oman.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/oman) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
