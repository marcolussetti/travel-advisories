For emergency services in Oman, dial 9999. Emergency hotlines are mostly Arabic-speaking. The U.S. Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens who were unable to receive assistance due to language barriers.

Response times for ambulance services vary.  Injured or seriously ill travelers may wish to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

See our Health Abroad page for more information.

* We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease [Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/oman?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) for Oman. Also, check the general Traveler Advice for Oman.
* Review all sub-sections. These include Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* Review the [CDC Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) webpage that provides advice on medical considerations including:
  + Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
  + Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
  + General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)
* Be sure you are up to date on all scheduled immunizations and recommended vaccines.
* Be sure to bring enough over-the-counter medications and prescriptions.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [Insurance Overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) page for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Ministry of Health](https://moh.gov.om/en/health-promotion/health-awareness/transporting-and-bringing-medicines-control-english/)to ensure the medication is legal in Oman.

**Vaccinations**: Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/oman) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
