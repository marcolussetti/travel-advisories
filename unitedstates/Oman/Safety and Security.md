# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**MARAD Report:** According to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. flag vessels in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab el Mandeb regions face an elevated risk of attacks by violent extremists.

U.S. flag vessels should report suspicious activity to:

* COMUSNAVCENT battle watch captain at 011-973-1785-3879
* U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 (toll-free), 202-267-2675, or 202-267-4477 (TDD).

**Crime**: There is minimal street crime in Oman, and violent crime is rare.

See the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information on scams.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 9999.  Emergency hotlines are mostly Arabic-speaking.  The U.S. Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens who were unable to receive assistance due to language barriers.  Contact the U.S. Embassy at +968 2464-3400.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.  The law in Oman does not specifically address domestic violence.  However, charges may be brought under other statutes.  Victims of domestic violence may file a complaint with the police, and reports indicate that police respond promptly and professionally.  The government operates a domestic violence hotline and a shelter for victims.

For additional information please see [Oman’s Penal Code](https://mjla.gov.om/eng/index.aspx) and our [Human Rights Report for Oman](https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/oman/).

Dial 1100 to reach the government-operated domestic violence hotline.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is generally well-regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
