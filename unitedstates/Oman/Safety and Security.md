# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**  Residents and visitors generally find Oman to be safe, and protests have been rare, peaceful, and closely monitored by the government. However, threats – including terrorism – remain. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and targets may include tourist locations, transportation hubs, places of worship, markets, shopping malls, or any place where large crowds gather. For this reason, the Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid protests and to always remain vigilant.

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**MARAD Report**: According to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. flag vessels in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab el Mandeb regions face an elevated risk of attacks by violent extremists.

U.S. flag vessels should report suspicious activity to:

* COMUSNAVCENT battle watch captain at 011-973-1785-3879
* U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 (toll-free), 202-267-2675, or 202-267-4477 (TDD).

**Crime**: There is minimal street crime in Oman, and violent crime is rare.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams may occur in Oman. **Review** the Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams and the FBI pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:**VPN/VoIP usage is restricted in Oman and could result in penalties.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. U.S. citizens can report crimes to the local police at 9999.  Emergency hotlines are mostly Arabic-speaking.  The U.S. Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens who were unable to receive assistance due to language barriers.  U.S. citizens should continue to call and directly report their situation until they reach an available English speaker.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.

**Domestic Violence:**  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. The law in Oman does not specifically address domestic violence. However, charges may be brought under other statutes. Victims of domestic violence may file a complaint with the police, and reports indicate that police respond promptly and professionally. The government operates a domestic violence hotline and a shelter for victims.

For additional information please see [Oman’s Penal Code](https://mjla.gov.om/) and our [Human Rights Report for Oman](https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/oman/).

Dial 1100 to reach the government-operated domestic violence hotline.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is generally regulated. Rules with regard to general practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Dangerous areas and activities are marked with signs. Trained staff are usually there to help with organized activities. If tourists get hurt, they can usually get medical help anywhere in the country. In smaller cities, it might take longer for medical help to arrive and assist. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
