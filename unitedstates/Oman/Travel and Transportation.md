# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions:** Road conditions in cities and along major highways are good. Road conditions in rural areas range from good to poor. During rare instances of rain, roads are prone to flash flooding.

Travel between cities can be dangerous due to poor lighting, wandering livestock, and speeding drivers.

**Public Transportation:** Public transportation is generally safe, although vehicles may swerve to pick up passengers without warning.

**Traffic Violations:**

The following traffic violations may result in jail sentences, fines, and/or deportation:

* driving without a license
* running a red light
* driving under the influence of alcohol
* failure to wear a seat belt
* talking on cell phones while driving (hands-free technology is allowed)
* excessive speeding or overtaking another vehicle
* failure to maintain a clean car

When involved in a traffic violation, cooperate with police officers and do not attempt to negotiate payment.

If you are involved in a traffic accident that involves injuries, death, or material damage to vehicles, do not move your vehicle until the police give you permission. Moving your car may be interpreted as an admission of guilt. For minor traffic accidents with no damage or injuries, you may move your vehicle to the side of the road.

**Traffic Guidelines:**

* Traffic circles are common. The driver already in the circle always has priority.
* Drivers flashing high beams are signaling that they want to pass.
* Do not turn right on a red traffic signal.

**Driving License Requirements:**

* Short-term visitors with a U.S. driver’s license may drive rental vehicles, but not privately registered cars.
* Residents must have an Omani driver's license.
* To obtain an Omani license, you must take a vision test and either have a U.S. license (with proof of being licensed for at least two years) or take a driving test.

**Car Insurance:**

* Insure rental cars against death, injury, and loss or damage.

Residents may insure their vehicles outside the Sultanate; however, third party liability insurance must be purchased locally.  For all traffic-related emergencies, call the Royal Oman Police at 9999. Have an Arabic speaker call when giving directions to a location, since English-speaking operators are not always available.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/safety/road.html) or the [Royal Oman Police website](https://www.rop.gov.om/english)for further information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Oman, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Oman’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. See the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)for further information.

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Oman should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal). Information may also be posted to the [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/) and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
