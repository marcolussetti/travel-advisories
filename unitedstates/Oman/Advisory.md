**Country Summary:** Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Oman, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).

**Terrorism Summary:** Residents and visitors generally find Oman to be safe, and protests have been rare, peaceful, and closely monitored by the government. However, threats – including terrorism – remain possible. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and targets may include tourist locations, transportation hubs, places of worship, markets, shopping malls, or any place where large crowds gather. The Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid protests and to always remain vigilant.
