# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

If you wish to enter Taiwan as a tourist or short-term visitor (less than 90 days), you do not need a visa. No extensions or changes of status are permitted. For visa-waiver travel, your U.S. passport must be valid through the number of days you intend to stay. Six-month passport validity is not required.

If you plan to stay longer than 90 days or plan to work or reside in Taiwan, you need a Taiwan visa prior to traveling. Visit the website for [the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the United States](https://www.taiwanembassy.org/us_en/index.html) for the most current visa information.

Taiwan and the United States both allow dual nationality. If you have dual Taiwan-U.S. nationality, you must enter/exit Taiwan on your Taiwan passport and enter/exit the United States on your U.S. passport.

See our website for information on [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) or the [prevention of international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/childabduction/en.html).
