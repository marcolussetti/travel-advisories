# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Potential for Civil Disturbances:** Taiwan enjoys a vibrant democracy, and both spontaneous and planned demonstrations occur.  Monitor media coverage of local and regional events and avoid public demonstrations.

**Potential for Typhoons and Earthquakes:**During the typhoon season (May through November), [Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau](https://www.cwb.gov.tw/eng/) issues typhoon warnings an average of five times a year (of which, three to four normally make landfall) and heavy rainstorm alerts more frequently. Taiwan also has severe earthquakes, with the most recent severe earthquake on April 3, 2024, with a 7.4 magnitude.  At least 18 people were killed and more than 1,100 injured.

**Disaster Preparedness:**

* Follow the guidance of local authorities in the event of a disaster. See the National Fire Agency’s page for information on “[Disaster Responses](https://www.nfa.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&ids=1371).”
* See the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website](https://emergency.cdc.gov/) on how to prepare for an emergency.

**Crime:** There is minimal street crime in Taiwan, and violent crime is rare. Take normal safety precautions, such as avoiding travel after dark or in deserted/unfamiliar areas.
