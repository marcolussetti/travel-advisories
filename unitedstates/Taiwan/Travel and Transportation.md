# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions, lighting, and traffic safety in cities and on major highways are generally good. Roads in major cities are generally congested. Be alert for the many scooters and motorcycles that weave in and out of traffic. Motor scooters are common throughout the island. Be alert for scooters when stepping out of public buses or exiting a car. Exercise caution when crossing streets because many drivers do not respect the pedestrian's right of way. Be especially cautious when driving on mountain roads, which are typically narrow, winding, and poorly banked, and which may be impassable after heavy rains. For example, Taiwan’s central cross-island highway is meandering and often has poor visibility. Exercise caution when driving on highways.

Please see AIT’s website for more details on [Driving in Taiwan](https://www.ait.org.tw/driving-in-taiwan/).

**Traffic Laws:** Passengers in all vehicles, including taxis, are required by law to wear seatbelts. When exiting a vehicle, you are legally required to ensure that no motor scooter, bicycle, or other vehicle is approaching from behind before opening the door. You will be fully liable for any injuries or damages if you fail to do so. Do not turn right on a red traffic signal. It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving without a hands-free kit in Taiwan. The legal limit for alcohol in the bloodstream of drivers in Taiwan is 15 mg per 100 ml of blood (0.03% BAC). This limit is strictly enforced. It is useful to have proof of car insurance and proof of ownership of the vehicle. On-the-spot fines are very common for minor traffic offences in Taiwan and are fixed for each offense. You will be told where to pay the fines and within what period of time. For more serious driving offenses, you will receive a court appearance.

Standard international driving laws apply with a few exceptions:

* You must have a warning triangle in your car to use if you break down or are involved in an accident.
* You cannot turn on a red light unless indicated.
* Many drivers run red lights, especially just after they change.

In an emergency:

* If you have a problem with your car, call the number on the rental documents or attached to the windscreen of your car.
* In the event of an accident, you should call the police “110” and medical assistance “119.” Provide the police with all the important information including the type of accident, details of vehicles involved and if there are any injuries or fatalities. The second call you should make is to your insurance company.
* You will need a police report for your insurance company. While waiting for the police, take photographs of the scene and take the names, addresses and telephone numbers of any witnesses. Do not move the vehicles unless it is necessary for safety reasons.
* Police will not ask for bribes.
* Police will ask parties involved in the traffic accident to do an alcohol test. This is standard operating procedure.
* If riding a motor scooter, you must wear a helmet.

**Public Transportation:**Public transportation is cheap, convenient, and generally safe. Uber is widely available for use. Taxis and buses may swerve to the side of the road to pick up passengers with little notice or regard for other vehicles.
