Taiwan has modern medical facilities, with state-of-the-art equipment available at many hospitals and clinics. Physicians are well trained, and many have studied in the United States and speak English. Hospital nursing services provide medication and wound care but generally do not provide the daily patient care functions found in U.S. hospitals.

For emergency services in Taiwan, dial 119.

**The Department of State, U.S. Embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Taiwan hospitals and doctors do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) website for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare](https://www.mohw.gov.tw/mp-2.html) to ensure the medication is legal in Taiwan.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all routine vaccinations recommended by the [U.S. CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/taiwan#vaccines-and-medicines). Vaccinations are available at all major Taiwan hospitals.

Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. For information on how to reduce the risk of contracting dengue, please visit [the U.S. CDC website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/dengue).
