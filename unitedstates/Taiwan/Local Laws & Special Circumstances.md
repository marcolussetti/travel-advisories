[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** **You are subject to local laws.** If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. See [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison authorities to notify the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) immediately.

* AIT can provide [a list of English-speaking lawyers](https://www.ait.org.tw/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/).
* Taiwan authorities typically do not permit foreigners accused of crimes to leave Taiwan while legal proceedings are ongoing.
* Penalties for illegal drug possession, use, or trafficking are severe, with long jail sentences and heavy fines.
* Taiwan also has the death penalty for certain violent crimes and drug offenses.
* See the U.S. Department of State’s [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies.html) for further information.

**Labor Disputes:**

* Avoid labor disputes by establishing all terms and conditions of employment or sponsorship in the labor contract at the beginning of your employment.

**Customs Regulations:** Taiwan has strict regulations on importing/exporting firearms, antiquities, medications, currency, and ivory. Contact the [Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO)](https://www.taiwanembassy.org/us_en/index.html) in Washington, D.C., or the nearest [Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO)](https://www.taiwanembassy.org/portalOfDiplomaticMission_en.html#NorthAmerica) in the United States for specific information [regarding customs requirements](https://eweb.customs.gov.tw/). See also [customs regulations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/customs-and-import.html).

**Health Screening Process:** To detect and prevent the spread of diseases, Taiwan scans the body temperature of all arriving passengers with an infrared thermal apparatus. Symptomatic passengers are required to fill out a form and may need to give an onsite specimen or see local health authorities. See also the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/).

**Judicial Assistance:**Authorities on Taiwan provide judicial assistance in response to letters rogatory from foreign courts in accordance with Taiwan's "Law Governing Extension of Assistance to Foreign Courts." For further information, please go to the [American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)’s website](https://www.ait.org.tw/).

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB rights events in Taiwan. Taiwan law prohibits education and employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. On May 24, 2019, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriages upon registration with a local household registration office in Taiwan. Same-sex marriages from other countries are recognized in Taiwan. LGB individuals may still face lack of tolerance, particularly in areas outside the capital and largest city Taipei. See [Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for Taiwan](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/taiwan/) and read our [LGB Travel Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html).

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:**Taiwan law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities and sets minimum fines for violations. By law, new public buildings, facilities, and transportation equipment must be accessible to persons with disabilities. See [Persons with Disabilities in the Human Rights Report for Taiwan (2022)](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/taiwan/).
