# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:**Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Demonstrations can be unpredictable. Past demonstrations have turned violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**Crime:**Lesotho has a high crime rate, and foreigners must remain vigilant at all times. Foreigners are frequently targeted and robbed and have been car-jacked and killed. U.S. citizens have reported incidents – including sexual assault, armed and unarmed confrontation, and home invasion – occurring in broad daylight. There are no indications that U.S. citizens are specifically targeted.

Crime is most prevalent in urban areas but can happen anywhere. Criminal incidents have occurred in popular restaurants, along poorly lit or unlit roads, and at locations frequented by foreigners. Victims have included tourists, volunteer workers, and employees of non-governmental organizations.

Extra caution should be exercised while walking through downtown Maseru, both at night and during the day. You are urged to exercise caution and avoid crowds, demonstrations, or any other form of public gathering. Traveling alone or at night is particularly dangerous due to limited street lighting and undeveloped road conditions.

There is a serious problem with theft from baggage at O.R. Tambo International Airport (Johannesburg). It is a required transit point for air travel to Lesotho. You should secure your luggage with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) approved locks, use an airport plastic wrapping service, and avoid placing any items of value in checked luggage. Make an inventory of items in checked baggage to aid in claims processing if theft does occur.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lesotho. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Lucrative sales
* Gold purchase
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Grandparent/Relative targeting
* Free Trip/Luggage
* Lotteries
* Inheritance notices
* Work permits/job offers
* Bank overpayments

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Tourism:**The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.See our webpage for more [information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867).
