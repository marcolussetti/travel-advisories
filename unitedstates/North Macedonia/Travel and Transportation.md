**Road conditions and safety:** road conditions in North Macedonia are very different than those in the United States. Driving safely in North Macedonia requires excellent defensive driving skills.

* Most major highways are in good condition. Many secondary urban and rural roads are not maintained and are poorly lit. Mountain roads may be narrow, poorly marked, and lack guardrails.
* During the winter months, snow plowing is limited, and roads can be very treacherous.
* Many vehicles are old and lack front or rear lights.
* Horse-drawn carts, livestock, deceased animals, rocks, and various other objects frequently obstruct roadways.
* Roadside emergency services are limited.
* In an emergency, drivers can contact the police or ambulance service by dialing 112. Pedestrians should be careful when using crosswalks to cross streets. Often, local drivers do not slow down or stop for pedestrians.
* Do not drive at night in rural mountain areas. There is poor or nonexistent lighting.

**Traffic Laws**: U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. driver's license and an International Driving Permit to drive in North Macedonia. This permit can only be obtained in the United States.

* In case of a traffic accident, you may contact the police (112). The authorities may keep a U.S. citizen's passport until the matter is settled. This depends on the seriousness and circumstances of the incident.
* Drivers should proceed with caution. Disregard for traffic laws is widespread. The number of traffic accidents and fatalities is much higher in North Macedonia than in other European countries.
* **High fines can be incurred for speeding**. The police issue tickets that include instructions for paying the fine online. The police are not authorized to collect fine payments.
* The maximum legal blood-alcohol limit for drivers is 0.05 ppm. There is a zero-tolerance policy for alcohol use for professional and student drivers (0.0 ppm). Failure to follow these limits may result in high fines.
* Using a cell phone while driving is illegal. All passengers are required to wear seat belts. All vehicles must have winter tires or universal tires and snow chains from November 15th to March 15th. Failure to follow these requirements will result in fines.
* Police: 112.

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation options are limited. Buses are available in Skopje, and most are reliable. Taxis from established companies are considered to be safe. Use metered taxis to avoid conflicts about the fare. Most taxis accept cash payments only.

* There are no commercial domestic flights.
* North Macedonia does not have a subway system. Uber is not present in the country and few, other reliable ridesharing options are available.
* There are intercity buses that run between most cities. These are widely regarded as reliable and safe.
* Rail conditions are poor, limited, and service is unreliable.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in North Macedonia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of North Macedonia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
