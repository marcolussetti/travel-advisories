Medical care in North Macedonia varies in quality by location and provider. Skopje boasts four private hospitals providing a range of services, from cardiovascular surgery to pediatric intensive care. However, the quality of care does not match that of U.S. healthcare. Beyond Skopje, medical care generally falls below standard, except for trauma services available in Ohrid.

In case of emergencies in North Macedonia, you should dial 112 for the general emergency line.

Ambulance services are:

* Not widely available, except in Skopje and major tourist areas, such as Ohrid. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* The government regulates the availability of prescription medications. Many medications approved in the United States are not approved in North Macedonia. Insulin is not available to non-citizens.
* Government-operated emergency services are substandard. Ambulances generally transport to state hospitals unless specifically requested to a private hospital. Private emergency services in Skopje, operated by private institutions, meet higher quality standards.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. For more information on travel insurance, visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance)

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations**

Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general**

* North Macedonia has adequate health facilities available nationwide. Health care in rural areas might not meet U.S. standards. Public medical clinics in rural areas lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors may ask for proof of adequate insurance or for payment “up front” before service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.
* U.S. citizens have raised concerns over unethical business practices. It is important to get information about payments, billing, and proposed medical procedures before consenting to care:
  + Certain hotels, resorts, or similar establishments may have exclusive contracts with medical providers. This could restrict your options if you need emergency medical care.
* Medical staff may speak little or no English.
* Generally, in public hospitals, only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or have a member of your family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.
* The availability of psychological and psychiatric care is limited, even in larger cities. Hospital-based mental health care is generally via government institutions.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

* Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Medical systems are different than in United States. North Macedonia does not have the same rules and regulations. If you plan to travel for medical care consult with your physician before traveling. Also, visit the CDC website for information and risks.
* It is highly recommended to get supplemental insurance for medical evacuation in the event of unexpected medical emergencies.
* Your legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in North Macedonia.
* The quality of care varies in North Macedonia. When planning elective surgery in North Macedonia, ensure that emergency medical facilities are available. Additionally, verify that the professionals are accredited and qualified.
* People traveling to North Macedonia for medical reasons must have the correct “medical” visa. Check the Government of North Macedonia’s website for more information.

**Pharmaceuticals**

Carry your prescription medicine in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check [Republic of North Macedonia Customs Administration](https://finance.gov.mk/customs-administration/?lang=en) to ensure the medication is legal.

* Medication should be purchased from a reputable pharmacy. Do not purchase medication without consulting a medical professional. Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.
* Over the counter and prescription medications are often available for sale with minimal controls. Counterfeit medication is common. It could be ineffective, the incorrect strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.
* [The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items)) and [the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/) enforce regulations that govern the transportation of medication into the United States. Medications purchased abroad must follow their requirements to be legally brought back into the country. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. For more information, please consult the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy**

Surrogacy is legal in North Macedonia. There are strict procedures that must be followed. Individuals who attempt to circumvent local law may face criminal prosecution. Consult the Ministry of Health’s [website](https://vlada.mk/node/17970?ln=en-gb), available in Macedonian and Albanian languages only.

* If you decide to have a child through ART or surrogacy, please see our [ART and Surrogacy Abroad page.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Surrogacy-Abroad.html)

**Water Quality**

Other than in the capital of Skopje, tap water is not potable in many areas, but bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water. Request bottled water. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality**

* Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in North Macedonia. Consult your doctor before traveling. Consider the impact smog and pollution may have on you.
* The air quality varies and fluctuates with the seasons. It is worst in the winter season. The air pollution levels in Skopje range from double to triple that of the most polluted regions in the United States. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
  + Infants, children, and teens.
  + People over 65 years of age.
  + Individuals with lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
  + People with heart disease or diabetes.
  + People who work or are active outdoors.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.
