# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties**: You are subject to local laws. Violating local laws, even unintentionally, can lead to expulsion, arrest, or imprisonment. If you wish to start a business that requires permits or licensing, you must consult with the appropriate local authorities first.

Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, our website for information on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116).

**Arrest Notification**: If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to contact the U.S. Embassy at once. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

* There are strict laws on exporting historically valuable or significant items. Exporting these things without the proper permit may lead to arrest, financial penalties, and imprisonment. North Macedonia's Customs Administration provides more information on customs regulations.
* Visitors should follow “no photography” signs. If you are in doubt, ask for permission before taking photographs. Do not photograph subjects that could be viewed as related to national security or military operations.
* Though major stores and restaurants typically accept credit cards, smaller establishments might not. It is recommended to have cash in the local currency (denar) on hand.
* Not declaring currency over 10,000 euros or its equivalent may lead to confiscation and legal proceedings. Penalties typically include a fine and a percentage of the undeclared amount.

**Faith-Based Travelers**: See our following webpages for details:

**Note:** North Macedonia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-lingual state. Religious or ethnic violence is rare, but there are tensions between groups.

**LGB Travelers**: Same-sex relationships are legal in North Macedonia, but LGB individuals continue to encounter considerable discrimination. Same-sex marriages are not legal. The country lacks openly gay-friendly venues. Recent reports indicate a rise in transphobic and homophobic language, and physical violence targeting LGB persons. We recommend exercising caution when attending LGB events.

See our [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers with disabilities or those requiring accessibility assistance:**

Individuals with disabilities may find levels of accessibility and accommodation very different compared to the United States. In North Macedonia, the law mandates accessibility for individuals with disabilities only for new buildings. New construction that does not always meet accessibility standards. Many public buildings remain inaccessible due to inconsistent inspections. Public transportation options for persons with disabilities are extremely limited. All buses acquired by the government for Skopje since 2013 are accessible. Public transportation in other areas continues to be largely inaccessible.
