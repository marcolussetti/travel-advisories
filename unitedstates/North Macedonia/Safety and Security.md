# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism**: Terrorist groups wish to harm U.S. citizens abroad. They sometimes use knives, firearms, or vehicles to target crowds. Possible terrorist targets are:

* Public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebrations, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Subways, buses, trains, and flights

North Macedonia has not had any recent terrorist events. There were some significant terrorism-related arrests in recent years. There is concern about the heightened risk of radical extremists conducting lone-wolf terror attacks. Authorities in North Macedonia have determined that ISIS members and sympathizers are present within the country. For more information, see our [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/terrorism.html) page.

**Crime**: Violent crime against U.S. citizens is rare. Theft and petty street crimes occur in areas where tourists and foreigners gather.

Do not leave anything of value in plain view in unattended vehicles.

* Lock the windows and doors of your house when not at home.
* Organized crime is present in North Macedonia. Violent confrontations between rival organizations occur on occasion.
* ATM use is generally safe. Take standard safety precautions and be aware of your surroundings.
* Pickpockets are a problem in crowded areas of Skopje. You should:
  + Be aware of your belongings and surroundings.
  + Know that pickpockets use various diversionary tactics to distract victims. They may use groups of children swarming the victim.
  + If pickpocketed, report the crime to the police.
* Cancel your credit cards immediately.

North Macedonia and the neighboring Balkan region continue to face challenges related to corruption and organized crime. These challenges include drug trafficking, money laundering, migrant trafficking, extortion, and property crime.

For further details, please consult the [Global Organized Crime Index.](https://ocindex.net/)

**Demonstrations**occur sporadically. They often result in traffic disruptions, particularly near the center of Skopje. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, or during major holidays or international events.

* Event demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Always be aware of your surroundings.
* Follow the instructions of North Macedonia’s authorities.

**Tourism:** The regulation of the tourism industry is inconsistent. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are infrequent. Often, hazardous areas or activities lack proper signage. Staff training or certification by the host government or recognized authorities may be absent. In case of injury, suitable medical treatment is usually accessible only in or near major cities. First responders have limited ability to reach and provide immediate medical care outside of these areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to buy medical evacuation insurance.
