For emergency services in Bangladesh, dial 999. Operators may not be proficient in English.

Ambulance services are available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance**

* Make sure health insurance plans provide coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on overseas insurance coverage.
* We strongly advise supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Medical Care**

* Though quality of care is below U.S. standards, most common illnesses can be treated locally. U.S. citizens often travel outside Bangladesh for routine surgical procedures and complicated medical treatment.
* A centrally coordinated medical emergency response system is not available. A [list of hospitals and doctors](https://bd.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/) in Dhaka can be found on the U.S. Embassy website.
* Bangladesh has no prohibitions on specific medications. Always carry prescription medication in original packaging with a doctor’s prescription.
* The sale of counterfeit medications has been reported, but medications from major pharmacies and hospitals are generally reliable.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/bangladesh?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

* You should consider the [Japanese Encephalitis](https://www.cdc.gov/japanese-encephalitis/about/index.html) vaccine.
* [Dengue](https://www.cdc.gov/Dengue/) is endemic in Bangladesh and cases occur year-round, with most cases typically happening between July and October. Should you develop symptoms of fever, headache, rash, or muscle/joint aching, you should seek medical attention early in your illness.
* [Malaria](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/index.html) is reported in 13 districts in the northeast and southeast regions of Bangladesh. If planning travel there, you should consult with your physician regarding taking medication for malaria prophylaxis.
* The CDC also considers Bangladesh an area with risk of [Zika](https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html) infection, though it is uncommon. Pregnant women, travelers with a pregnant partner, and women considering becoming pregnant should speak to their healthcare provider about possible Zika risk before travel.

**Prevention is key**

* Regular use of insect repellent and long garments is recommended as protection against mosquito-borne illness.
* Water supplies in Bangladesh are non-potable. Bottled drinking water is generally safe for consumption.
* Foodborne illnesses are common. Wash, soak in sanitizing solution, peel, and thoroughly cook all food to minimize chemical, bacterial, and parasitic contamination.

**Air Quality**

Air quality in Dhaka is consistently poor and especially hazardous from November to March.

* We recommend avoiding prolonged outdoor exposure during these months.
* N95 filtration masks/respirators that are NIOSH certified are helpful, but you need to have a good fit and seal when using them.
* Current Dhaka air quality can be found [here](https://bd.usembassy.gov/air-quality-data/).

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Bangladesh.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
