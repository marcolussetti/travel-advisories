# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be detained and/or deported. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are particularly severe, including long jail sentences, heavy fines, or even death.

* You may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport with you, or if you take pictures of certain buildings, such as military facilities, embassies, police stations, shipyards, traffic inspection facilities, or airports. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. You should exercise caution when photographing government facilities in general.
* Driving under the influence is illegal and could result in immediate incarceration.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Drones:** All forms of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), also known as “drones,” are highly regulated and restricted in Bangladesh and are subject to import and flight restrictions. Failure to obtain import and/or flight permission can result in detention and/or arrest, as well as confiscation of the RPAS. Visit the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladeshwebsite for the latest RPAS

**Forced Marriage:** A marriage must be entered into with the full and free consent of both individuals. We can assist and provide information if you are forced into a marriage against your will. Please refer to our [information on forced marriage](https://bd.usembassy.gov/forced-marriage/). All travelers to Bangladesh, including Bangladeshi citizens, should maintain possession of their passports and return plane tickets to ensure independence to travel.

**Registration for Renters:** The Bangladesh Government requests biodata and other personal information from all residents. This registration is mandatory for renters. Dual nationals, former Bangladesh nationals, and “No Visa Required” seal holders are considered Bangladeshi for registration purposes.

**Property Disputes:**

* Land disputes are common in Bangladesh and are extremely difficult to resolve through legal channels.
* We cannot protect personal property and cannot take sides in a legal dispute.
* If you wish to purchase property in Bangladesh, be aware of the risks -- particularly if you will not be physically present to oversee your property.

**Natural Disasters:**

* Heavy flooding occurs during the monsoon season (June to October), and 30 percent of the country may be under water. Lightning strikes are common during the monsoon season and outdoor activity should be avoided during storms. Landslides can also occur during heavy rains, particularly in the hill tracts area of the Bandarban district in the southeast.
* Cyclones occur most frequently in the pre-monsoon (April and May) and post-monsoon (October and November) seasons and could include wind speeds of up to 150 km/hr and storm surges of up to five meters.
* Bangladesh is at severe risk from tornadoes.
* Bangladesh is in a zone 2B earthquake fault region, with a moderate probability of damaging ground motion. The overwhelming majority of structures in Bangladesh would not withstand a moderate earthquake. Although earthquakes are more likely to occur in the north of the country, destruction from an earthquake is expected to be most acute in urban areas. Post-earthquake disaster relief capabilities are extremely limited.

You should make contingency plans for travel in Bangladesh. Leave emergency contact information with family members outside of Bangladesh and enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)). General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/) and at [Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/).

**Fire Safety:** Fires in residential and commercial buildings are common in Bangladesh, and first responders' capacity to control flames is limited. Many multi-story residential buildings and shopping malls lack proper fire extinguishers, emergency exits, among other fire safety features. Stay aware of your surroundings and emergency exits.

**LGB Rights:** Consensual same-sex sexual activity is criminalized in Bangladesh and penalties include up to life imprisonment. See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbti.html) page and section six of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details. In 2016, AQIS targeted and killed two prominent members of the Bangladesh LGB community in their apartment because of their human rights activism and sexual orientation.

**Persons with Mobility Issues:** Public transportation, sidewalks, many buildings, and most public areas are not wheelchair accessible.
