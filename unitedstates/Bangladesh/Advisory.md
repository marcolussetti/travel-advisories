***Updated to reflect the Travel Advisory Level, Level 4 area, information on civil unrest, and the removal of Ordered Departure information.***

Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to **civil unrest, crime,**and **terrorism**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Do not travel to:

* The Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to **communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks**.

**Country Summary:**Since the July 2024 **civil unrest**, violent clashes have largely ended, but conditions may change on short notice.  U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, that could turn violent with little or no warning.

Travelers should be aware of petty **crimes** such as pickpocketing in crowded areas.  Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute most criminal activity in Bangladesh’s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality.  These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.

**Terrorist attacks** can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities.

Because of security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel in Bangladesh are subject to some travel restrictions. The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka, due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bangladesh.html) for additional information on travel to Bangladesh.

If you decide to travel to Bangladesh:

* Avoid demonstrations and political gatherings; demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and quickly escalate into violence.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust plans.
* Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Get to a safe area and report any criminal incident to local authorities.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive alerts including updates on consular services and so it is easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Follow the State Department on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/statedept/) or [X](http://twitter.com/TravelGov).
* Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/249e43e5-d5e6-4506-86bf-1ce7eab76dec) for Bangladesh.
* Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.
* Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Please review the [Traveler’s Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).

**Level 4: Do Not Travel - Chittagong Hill Tracts Region**

The Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) experience occasional **communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks**. Kidnappings have occurred in the region, including those motivated by domestic or familial disputes, and those targeting members of religious minorities.  Separatist organizations and political violence also pose additional threats to visitors to the region, and there have been instances of IED explosions and active shooting.  Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas.
