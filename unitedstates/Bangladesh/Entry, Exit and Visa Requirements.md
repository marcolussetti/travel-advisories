# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Passports and Visas:**

* Passports must be valid for six months beyond your planned stay in Bangladesh, have at least one blank page, and have a Bangladeshi visa or get a visa on arrival. You must possess an onward or return ticket.
* **Obtaining a visa before travel is strongly recommended.** Although U.S. citizens are eligible to apply for a tourist visa on arrival, there is no guarantee you will receive one. U.S. citizens born outside the United States may be subject to increased scrutiny or further requirements at ports of entry. Some U.S. citizens have been denied entry into Bangladesh despite believing they had fulfilled the requirements for a visa on arrival. Visit the [Embassy of Bangladesh](https://bd.usembassy.gov/) website for visa information.
* Short-term travelers can be denied entry if they cannot demonstrate sufficient financial liquidity.
* Visas must be in a valid passport. In Bangladesh, you may obtain a replacement visa at the [Department of Immigration and Passports](https://dip.gov.bd/site/page/0b199b01-3cae-4245-9c5c-e0b51cb456f9/Divisional-Passport-&-Visa-Officess). Replacing a visa, which is required to exit the country, may take three to four business days.
* There are penalties for overstaying a visa, and it can be very difficult and time-consuming to change immigration status after arrival. Overstay penalties are as follows:
  + 1 to 14 days: 200 Bangladeshi taka per day + $160 U.S. dollars (or equivalent in Bangladeshi taka) processing fee payable at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka.
  + 15 to 30 days: 500 Bangladeshi taka per day + $160 U.S. dollars (or equivalent in Bangladeshi taka) processing fee payable at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka.
  + 31 to 90 days: Fine adjudicated and processed at Department of Immigration and Passport Office, 7th Sher-E-Bangla Nagar, Agargaon, Dhaka.
  + Over 90 days: Potential prosecution by the Department of Immigration and Passport Authority under Article 31 of the Foreigners Act of 1946.

**Exit Taxes:**

* When traveling by air, all foreigners except children under the age of two, must pay a departure tax. While often included when air tickets are purchased, it may be collected at the airport at the time of departure. The amount varies depending on the destination.
* If departing by road in a private vehicle, you must obtain a road exit permit by contacting the Director General, South Asia Wing, [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mofa.gov.bd/).

**U.S.-Bangladesh Dual Nationals:**

* If you are a U.S.-Bangladeshi dual national, you and your immediate family members are eligible for a “No Visa Required for Travel to Bangladesh” seal. Your nearest Bangladeshi Embassy or consulate can issue this seal in your U.S. passport.
* If you hold both U.S. and Bangladeshi citizenship, you may not be immediately recognized as a U.S. citizen by the local authorities and may be treated as a Bangladeshi citizen.
* Read more information about [dual nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) on our website.

**Customs:**

* Bangladeshi customs authorities may strictly enforce regulations concerning temporary import or export of items such as currency, household appliances, alcohol, cigarettes, and weapons.
* Bangladesh does not allow the exchange of local currency (Bangladeshi taka) for U.S. dollars (cash and traveler’s checks) unless the customer has a ticket for travel outside Bangladesh.
* Contact the Bangladeshi Embassy or consulates for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please also see our [Customs Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/other-legal/customs-and-import.html) page.
