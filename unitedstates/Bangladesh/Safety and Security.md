# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

The U.S. government assesses that there remains a credible terrorist threat against foreigners in Bangladesh. U.S. citizens in Bangladesh should take precautions, remain vigilant, and be alert to local security developments.

There has been no significant terrorist attack in Bangladesh since March 2017, but the country remains a target of several foreign terrorist organizations. If you observe high-profile police activity, depart the area immediately.

Al-Qa’ida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) retains a presence in Bangladesh; the group last carried out attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed several secular bloggers, publishers, and human rights activists; a U.S. citizen was among the victims.

The following groups, including several on the U.S. government’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, are active in Bangladesh:

* Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), known locally as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB or “Neo-JMB”)
* Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), known locally as Ansar al-Islam
* Lashkar-e-Tayyiba
* Indigenous sectarian groups

U.S. government personnel in Bangladesh live, work, and travel under strict security guidelines and are prohibited from:

* Traveling via non-registered rickshaws outside designated areas.
* Traveling via public buses or compressed natural gas autorickshaw (CNG).
* Traveling between cities via motor vehicle after hours of darkness.
* The use of rideshare apps only within city limits.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is nascent, unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are often not identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
