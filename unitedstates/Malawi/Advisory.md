Exercise increased caution in Malawi due to **crime** and **civil unrest.**

**Country Summary:** Violent crime such as theft, burglary, armed robbery, and assault is common. The capabilities of the Malawi Police Service are growing but its resources and abilities to deter and investigate crimes, assist victims, and apprehend criminals are limited.

Demonstrations may occur and increase in frequency due to political issues and events such as elections. Tear gas is frequently deployed at demonstrations and roads may be blocked.
