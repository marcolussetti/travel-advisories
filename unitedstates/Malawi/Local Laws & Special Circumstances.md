# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Visa Infractions:** U.S. citizens entering Malawi with tourist visas or visitor’s permits have been arrested, fined, and deported if found engaging in activities inconsistent with their tourist status, e.g., business or volunteer services.

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are able to contact a relative or friend, you should also ask them to contact the U.S. Embassy on your behalf.

See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** Wild animals pose a threat to life and safety even in the most serene settings. Please observe local or park regulations and heed all instructions given by tour guides.

Credit cards are not commonly accepted outside of major cities. There are a limited number of ATMs in Malawi that accept Visa, MasterCard, and international ATM cards.

Dress codes prohibiting short skirts on women and long hair on men no longer exist. However, travelers should be aware that Malawi is a conservative society so be mindful of your dress, especially when visiting remote or rural areas.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**LGB Travelers:** LGB persons are denied, by law and practice, basic civil, political, social, and economic rights in Malawi. Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison, including hard labor. The penal code outlaws “unnatural offenses” and “indecent practices between males.” Same-sex sexual activity may also be prosecuted as “conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace.”  As of July 2014, the government has implemented a moratorium on the enforcement of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity, though the general public largely remains hostile to LGB persons.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/) for further details.

**Travelers With Disabilities:**The law in Malawi prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced consistently. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Some modern buildings may have wheelchair accessible entrances. Generally, public transportation is not accessible for travelers with disabilities. The Disability Act of 2013 prohibits discrimination in education, health care, social services, the workplace, housing, political life, and cultural and sporting activities for persons with disabilities. However, the government has yet to adopt standards and plans for its enforcement and implementation.

**Women Travelers:** The penal code criminalizes rape of women and girls with a maximum penalty of death for conviction. The 2015 Marriage, Divorce, and Family Relations Act explicitly introduced the concept of spousal rape, but the act does not prescribe specific penalties for conviction and applies only to legally separated spouses. Spousal rape may be prosecuted under the rape provisions of the penal code. The government generally enforces the law effectively, and convicted rapists routinely receive prison sentences. Data on the prevalance of rape or spousal rape, prosecutions, and convictions is unavailable; however, press reporting or rape and defilement arrests and convictions are an almost daily occurence. Although the maximum penalty for conviction of rape is death or life imprisonment, the courts generally impose lesser prison sentences.

Although sexual harassment was believed to be widespread, there is no data on its prevalence or on the effectiveness of government enforcement of the law. The law makes conviction of sexual harassment punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment and places an obligation on government to have policies and procedures aimed at eliminating sexual harassment. Conviction of “insulting the modesty” of a woman is a misdemeanor punishable by one year’s incarceration. Conviction in extreme cases, such as indecent assault on a woman or girl is punishable by sentences of up to 14 years’ imprisonment.
