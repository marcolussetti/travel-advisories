[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

See the Department of State [Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/malawi-travel-advisory.html) and Alerts for Malawi.

For emergency services in Malawi, dial 998. Please note this number is not reliable and travelers should maintain back-up numbers, such as police and ambulance services, for the areas they visit.

**Crime**: Crime is common in Malawi. Most crimes against U.S. citizens involve property. Residential break-ins are frequent; perpetrators are usually well armed and may become violent with little provocation. Petty street crime (robbery and pickpocketing) is common. There have been break-ins at hotels and lodges throughout the country. Kidnappings occur and non-Malawians have been targeted in Zomba.

Carjackings occur, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Carjackers often block the rear of a victim’s vehicle while it waits to pass through a security gate into a residence. Then, the assailants threaten the driver and take the car. Victims are often assaulted. Drivers are advised to lock their car doors, close their windows, and remain vigilant when entering or exiting a residence. When traveling, ensure your windows are up and doors are locked.

You should avoid traveling on foot at night, especially in urban areas, as armed muggings and assaults have occurred. Non-Malawians have been targeted in Lilongwe, and several U.S. citizens have been injured. City streets should be considered unsafe after dark even when walking in a large group. Pedestrians should also be cautious during daylight hours. Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service.

The capacity and availability of public security forces is limited, we recommend you use caution when visiting and/or especially when staying in less populated areas such as the Mount Mulanje region. You should take appropriate action to ensure your safety if traveling to remote areas, and never travel alone or at night. Ensure you are communicating with a friend or family member as to your whereabouts while traveling in Malawi, as cell phone reception is limited in many areas.

**Demonstrations** frequently occur. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays or election dates, or during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent. Be aware of tear gas and other riot control measures.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories. Both spontaneous and planned civil disturbances and demonstrations, primarily related to governance and economic issues, can occur. U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

**Tourism:** The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.
