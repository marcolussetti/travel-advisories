### Quick Facts

PASSPORT VALIDITY:

6 months

BLANK PASSPORT PAGES:

One page for entry stamp

TOURIST VISA REQUIRED:

No, if visiting for 30 days or less on a U.S. passport.

VACCINATIONS:

Yellow fever, at least 10 days before arrival is required for travelers originating from or transiting through WHO-designated yellow fever countries.

CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR ENTRY:

Must declare all foreign currency upon arrival. Doing so helps to ensure travelers will be allowed to depart Malawi with foreign currency.

CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR EXIT:

$5,000 is the maximum amount of foreign currency with which travelers may exit the country. Funds in excess of this amount (and previously undeclared upon arrival) may be confiscated and travelers may be arrested for failure to declare the foreign currency. Currency regulations are controlled by multiple entities, change often, and are not consistently applied by authorities. Citizens have spent months detained while Malawi authorities attempt to determine which regulations apply.
