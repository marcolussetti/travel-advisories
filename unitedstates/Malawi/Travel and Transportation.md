# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Most roadways, except for major thoroughfares, are not paved, leading to accessibility problems during the November to April rainy season. Almost all roadways lack lighting at night. Most roads do not have sidewalks, forcing pedestrians and livestock to use the roadways both day and night. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of death among travelers to Malawi. Safety hazards include the lack of road shoulders, potholes, pedestrians, bicyclists, and livestock. You should drive defensively and avoid road travel outside cities at night.  Road support networks for stranded drivers do not exist. Fuel supply, both diesel and gasoline, is often erratic and travelers should plan accordingly. We do not recommend travel by foot along roadways.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:** Police roadblocks are common but properly documented drivers usually pass quickly and without incident. Malawian police operate radar-based speed traps throughout the country, and you are expected to pay fines on the spot—please ensure you get a receipt. Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You should always wear a seat belt whenever available and insist drivers maintain a safe speed.

**Public Transportation:**Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service.

Avoid public transportation, which is extremely limited and unreliable. Public transportation primarily consists of private citizens driving independently, and unregulated passenger vans in varying but generally poor states of condition and repair. These vehicles are frequently overburdened, and the drivers are inexperienced and untrained. In the cities, public transport includes bicycle taxis or small, motorized tricycles; each is unsafe. Modern coach buses are increasingly common on the main cross-country routes.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**Aviation concerns in Malawi have intensified following two plane crashes in 2024. In response to these incidents, authorities have faced growing pressure to modernize aviation infrastructure, adopt stricter safety regulations, and improve weather monitoring systems to prevent future accidents. As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Malawi, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Malawi’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.
