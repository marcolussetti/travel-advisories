For emergency services in Malawi, dial 998. Please note this number is not reliable and travelers should maintain back-up numbers, such as police and ambulance services, for the areas they visit.

Ambulance services are not widely available. The training and availability of emergency responders are generally below U.S. standards. More information can be found [here](https://mw.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).

Medical facilities are rudimentary. While all health workers have some degree of English proficiency, communication can be difficult. Diarrhea and other food borne illnesses are a common problem. You should avoid tap water, ice cubes, and raw fruits and vegetables. Bottled water is recommended for drinking and food preparation. Consume only food that is well-cooked and served hot.

Many medications are not available. You should bring adequate quantities of medications to last the duration of your stay. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. We encourage you to check with your primary healthcare provider or local travel clinic regarding malaria prophylaxis medications.

For major medical problems, you should consider obtaining medical treatment in South Africa, where advanced medical care is available.

We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) and general [Traveler Advice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) for Malawi.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.

The Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

The U.S. Embassy maintains a [list of doctors and hospitals](https://mw.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/), available at https://mw.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general:**

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Hospitals and doctors require advance payment prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.
* Private hospitals require advance payment before admitting a patient.
* Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/human-drug-imports) websites for more information.

**Non-Traditional Medicine**

* U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications while seeking medical care from non-traditional healers and practitioners in Malawi. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.

**Water Quality**

* Tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be from tap water.

**Adventure Travel**

* Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Adventure Travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/adventure).
