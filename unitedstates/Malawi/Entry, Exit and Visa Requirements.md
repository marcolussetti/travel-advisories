# Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements

[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

Visas are not required for U.S. citizens, including all diplomats and government offices, visiting Malawi for less than 30 days.

Travelers seeking to live, work, or study in Malawi should visit the [Malawi immigration website](https://www.immigration.gov.mw/) for more information.  Visitors seeking to extend their visas can go to a local immigration office and pay for a longer-validity visa.  Be aware that the visa overstay fine is $25 a day and must be paid before exiting the country. .

**Immunizations:** The government of Malawi requires proof of yellow fever vaccination upon arrival if traveling from a yellow fever country.  Please review the [Centers for Disease Control website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/malawi) for a list of vaccines and medicines for Malawi.

You must declare all foreign currency when entering Malawi, no matter the amount.   You must also exchange foreign currency at a bank or approved foreign exchange bureaus.  Any currency declared at entry may be expatriated without further authorization.  With bank approval, you may export up to $5,000 per trip.  Otherwise, you are not permitted to export currency and it will be confiscated at the point of departure.  U.S. citizens in Malawi have been arrested and detained for months for unlawful possession of foreign currency and failure to declare foreign currency.

For travelers transiting South Africa on their way to Malawi, the South African government requires proof of yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days prior to arrival in South Africa if arriving from or transiting through a yellow fever country; those without proof may be turned around at the South African port of entry. Travelers transiting South Africa with minor children should carry the child’s birth certificate and/or legal custody documents.  If a minor child is transiting with only one parent, South African authorities may ask for notarized authorization for the child’s travel from the non-traveling parent.  For complete entry/exit requirements for South Africa, please see our [Country Specific Information for South Africa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthAfrica.html).

The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Malawi.
