# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.

Slovakia has seen an increase in the number of demonstrations in response to political events. Though still relatively rare, small, and so far peaceful, demonstrations and gatherings always have the potential to turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. Please see the U.S. Embassy’s website for [safety and security messages](https://sk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/).

**Crime:** while crime is relatively low, street crimes against tourists do occur in tourist areas.

* The most common crimes reported include pickpocketing and cell phone and bag/purse theft, particularly during the summer months. Most thefts reported by U.S. citizens occur at crowded tourist sites (such as Bratislava’s Old Town area) or on public buses, trams, or trains.
* Be alert to criminal schemes. Thieves, including adults and/or children, often work in groups or pairs. In many cases, an individual or group distracts the victim, sometimes with musical instruments or pets, so that others can pickpocket.
* Criminals target tourists at nightclubs with ties to organized crime. In the past, such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bills and threatened those who refuse to pay. They also spike drinks with disabling drugs and take the impaired victims to ATMs and coerce them to withdraw funds until they empty their accounts or the card is blocked.
* Domestic and foreign organized criminal organizations are well established in Slovakia. Though uncommon, violent incidents sometimes do occur.

**Tourism:** Within Bratislava the tourism industry is generally regulated and rules are enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically available to support organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available in the city. Outside Bratislava and throughout the country, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections of equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by either the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
