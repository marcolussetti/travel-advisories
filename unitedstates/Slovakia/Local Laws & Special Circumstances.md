# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

* **Do not purchase counterfeit or pirated goods**. They are illegal in the United States and you may be breaking local laws as well.
* **Driving under the influence is a crime and may land you in jail**. The blood alcohol tolerance level is **zero percent**.
* **It is illegal to take photographs of security or military installations**. If you violate this law, authorities may confiscate the pictures and recordings, issue a reprimand or fine, or even expel you from the country.
* **If you are over 16 years of age or older, you are required by law to carry a passport and/or a Slovak identity card at all times**. A photocopy of your passport is not sufficient, although we recommend that you keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
* **Slovak customs authorities enforce strict regulations** concerning temporary import or export of firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, *et al*. Contact the [Embassy of the Slovak Republic](https://www.mzv.sk/web/washington-en) or a [Slovak consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup) in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.
* **Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:**LGB U.S. Citizens in same-sex marriages or civil unions who travel to or reside in Slovakia may face difficulties and legal issues, as the country does not recognize same-sex unions and adopted a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2014. Same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults is legal. Slovak law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and classifies crimes based on sexual orientation as hate crimes, though these laws are not always enforced. Prejudice and societal discrimination persist. LGB persons occasionally report that they receive anti-LGB verbal abuse in the form of slurs. However, Bratislava and Kosice have hosted annual Pride parades without major incident since 2010.

Seeour [LGB Travel Information](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/lgbt.html)page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**Slovak law requires that public areas be accessible to persons with disabilities. Many older buildings and areas, however, have not been retrofitted.  Navigating most Slovak cities with a visual impairment or on a wheelchair is difficult due to the many obstacles and barriers on sidewalks and in public transport. Guide dogs are allowed in all municipal spaces, but may not be allowed in private shops, restaurants, and hotels; it is advised to call ahead to inquire.  See our [Traveling with Disabilities](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/traveling-with-disabilties.html) page.

* Many sidewalks are narrow and uneven, and small towns may lack sidewalks.
* Some municipal spaces, such as post offices, hospitals, shopping centers, and libraries have either an elevator or platforms to accommodate customers who cannot use stairs.  Small restaurants and shops are less likely to be accessible.
* Traffic lights in some city centers have a sound signal for the visually-impaired, however, it is reported that they are often out-of-service.  Public signs for the visually-impaired are uncommon.
* The state television channels provide broadcasting for the hearing-impaired, and important national events frequently have visible sign language interpretation in real-time.
* Public transportation and the railway system stations generally lack elevators and do not provide easy access for people with mobility issues.  This is true even in the capital city of Bratislava.
* Only a few buses are equipped with lowering platforms, while trams have none.
