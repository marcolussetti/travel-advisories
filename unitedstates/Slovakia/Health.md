**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* **Without Slovak health insurance, ambulance service starts at 120 euros per transport**.
* Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.
* You may need special insurance for **hiking and skiing**, which is available from local providers.
* If you **stay longer than 90 days**, you need local health insurance.
* The tick-borne encephalitis vaccination is recommended. Contact your doctor for more information.

**We do not pay medical bills**

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the [Slovak Ministry of Health](https://www.health.gov.sk/Index.aspx) to ensure the medication is legal in Slovakia.

The following disease is prevalent:

* **Tick-borne encephalitis** (TBE) can result from the bites of ticks commonly found in the bushes and grass of forests in Slovakia at lower and middle elevations. **They are most active from spring to late fall especially in the northern regions of Trencin and Zilina.**Low risk exists throughout the rest of the country. Transmission occurs throughout the year, with highest activity from June through September.
* Even though the CDC does not explicitly recommend the TBE vaccine, **other official European sources have recommended the TBE vaccine for travelers who plan to stay for extended periods or who plan to camp and stay outdoors.**Vaccines are available through a general practitioner or a pediatrician in Slovakia but are not available in the U.S.

**Vaccinations**

Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Health facilities in general**

* Adequate health facilities are available throughout the country.
* Doctors, hospitals, and ambulance services in Slovakia **expect cash payment** unless the patient can present an insurance number from the [Slovak National Insurance Company](https://www.slovensko.sk/en/life-situation/life-situation/_social-and-health-insurance-fo/)or show proof of private insurance prior to needing medical care.
* Travelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.

**Medical Tourism and Elective Surgery**

Although Slovakia has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies.  If you plan to undergo surgery in Slovakia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.

* People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the [CDC Medical Tourism](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism) for more information on Medical Tourism.
* Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Slovakia.

Cities in Slovakia have air pollution levels similar to those in major U.S. cities. Levels are generally low during the warm season but sometimes worse than U.S. standards in the cold season. Visit [the European Environment Agency’s website](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-index/index) for information on air quality in Slovakia.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas.

* Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in Slovakia.
* For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/).
* For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
