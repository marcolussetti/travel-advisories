Slovakia is a party to the Schengen Agreement. This means that U.S. citizens may enter Slovakia for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa.

**Traveling Through Europe**: If you are planning to visit or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement.

* Your passport should be valid for **at least six months upon arrival in the Schengen.** If you plan on transiting a Schengen country review our [U.S. Travelers in Europe page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
* You will need s**ufficient proof of funds** and a **return plane ticket**.
* For additional information about visas for the Schengen area, see the [Schengen Visa page.](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/)

Carry **proof of sufficient funds** (such as a credit card) and make sure your **medical insurance** policy covers all costs if in need of hospitalization and medical treatment in Slovakia.

* Upon arrival in Slovakia, you must **register with the local Border and Alien Police within three working days if you are staying in a private home**. Hotels and official accommodation providers will register you automatically.
* If you want to **reside in Slovakia or stay longer than 90 days**, you must apply for a temporary residency and/or work permit. You should complete the application process through the Slovak Embassy in Washington, D.C. **prior to arriving in the country**. If you decide to stay longer at the time of our arrival in Slovakia, you should **begin the process upon arrival as the process normally takes longer than the 90 days** allowed visa free. Read the requirements on the [U.S. Embassy website](https://sk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/residency-permit/) and prepare your application before traveling. Many required documents, such as an [FBI clearance](https://ucr.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/student-brochure), are easier to obtain in the United States. To follow up on the status of a request, please contact the FBI directly at [identity@jc.fbi.gov](mailto:identity@jc.fbi.gov).
* **Slovak authorities strictly enforce residency laws.**Foreigners who stay beyond 90 days without a residency permit may be ordered to depart, or may even be deported with a possible ban on re-entry to the [entire Schengen area](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/US_Travelers_in_Europes_Schengen_Area.html).
