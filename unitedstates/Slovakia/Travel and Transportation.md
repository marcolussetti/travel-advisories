# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:**Roads in Slovakia are generally safe and well-maintained. Four-lane highways exist in and around Bratislava. Most roads outside of developed areas; however, are two lanes only. **Aggressive drivers** attempting to pass at unsafe speeds pose a serious hazard.

* Use **caution** when driving outside urban areas at night. The roads are narrow, winding, and poorly lit.
* **From November through March, Slovakia experiences heavy snow**. Snow removal is not adequate on rural roads. Roads in the mountainous northern part of the country are particularly prone to hazardous conditions during winter months. **The law requires winter tires for snowy conditions**, and chains are necessary in certain mountainous areas.

**Traffic Laws:**You must use seatbelts and **headlights** at all times. It is illegal to use cellular phones while driving.

* Children under 12 year of age, weighing less than 80 pounds in weight or less than 5 feet in height must use a car seat or a booster.
* You must have a motorcycle license and wear a helmet to operate a motorized two-wheeled vehicle.
* Reflective safety vests and first aid kits must be in each vehicle.
* **Driving under the influence of ANY alcohol is a crime under Slovak law.** The blood alcohol tolerance level is **zero percent**. Police stop cars randomly to perform breath tests.
* If you get a ticket, you can pay the fine in cash on the spot to the officer.  If you cannot pay the fine on the spot, you will receive a notice to appear later at a police station, and the fine will be higher. Reportedly, foreigners are sometimes cited for more expensive violations than they commit, in an attempt to collect extra money from people who may not know the rules well.

As of January 1, 2016, you need to buy an electronic vignette to use certain highways and motorways. A vignette is a sticker that fixes to the windscreen to be clearly visible from the outside, showing that you’ve paid to drive along those roads. You can purchase it [online](https://eznamka.sk/en/evignettes/types-and-prices).

You must obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) prior to your arrival if you intend to drive in Slovakia. You can get an IDP in the United States from the [American Automobile Association](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup)and the [American Automobile Touring Alliance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup).

* U.S. citizen visitors may drive with a valid U.S. state license, if accompanied by a valid IDP for the duration of their 90-day stay. Visitors who are long-term residents in Slovakia must apply to exchange their U.S. state driver’s license for a Slovak driver’s license within a specified time period after receiving a residency permit.
  + More information is available from the Dopravny Inspektorat at the district police department in your place of residence.
* For specific information concerning a Slovak driver’s permit, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance, contact the [Embassy of Slovakia](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup) in Washington, D.C.
* Additional information about driving in Slovakia can be found on the Embassy [website](https://sk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/driving-in-slovakia/).

**Public Transportation:**Buses, trolleybuses, and trams are mechanically safe and generally reliable. We recommend using clearly marked taxicabs.

* On public transportation, you must **validate a ticket** upon entering the vehicle. The ticket is valid for your entire journey. Major cities also offer tickets by SMS message through a local telephone service provider.
* In most cities, you can buy passes valid for periods ranging from 24 hours to one year. Children from six to 15 years of age pay reduced fares.
* **A ticket inspector will fine passengers who are traveling without a valid ticket**; inspectors board transportation at random. The ticket inspector will have an identification card and must provide a receipt for the fare.
* More information is provided in English on the [Bratislava city transport website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup)and websites of other cities with public transportation.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Slovakia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Slovakia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Slovakia.html#ExternalPopup).
