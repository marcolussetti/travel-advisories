Medical care in Chile is generally good, though it may not meet U.S. standards in remote areas. Major hospitals accept credit cards. Santiago has one private hospital accredited by The American Hospital Association: [Clinica Alemana](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Chile.html#ExternalPopup).

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information insurance coverage overseas. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of [Chile](https://www.ispch.cl/anamed/) to ensure the medication is legal in Chile. Always carry a sufficient supply of your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
