# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, visit our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://cl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Special Circumstances:** Chile is prone to major earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, tsunamis, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service ([SENAPRED](https://senapred.cl/)) provides alerts and guidance for these types of events. There are emergency preparedness guides available on the [Ready.gov](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ready.gov%2Fbe-informed&data=05%7C01%7CReardonAJ%40state.gov%7C3e8438dd089649b8e8c008db18c830c1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638131020306664132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5qmJ9DTBTs6TsJzy9VshkUHBYlOmxy4WC0v9u1UaXyc%3D&reserved=0) and Federal Emergency Management Agency ([FEMA](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fema.gov%2Femergency-managers%2Findividuals-communities%2Fpreparedness-activities-research-webinars&data=05%7C01%7CReardonAJ%40state.gov%7C3e8438dd089649b8e8c008db18c830c1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638131020306664132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nHH6Z7FSP1i%2Fn%2BiRY11CjItt7eGWYsO1pO5mvKNvf74%3D&reserved=0)) websites. It is important to make a plan and to keep emergency supplies accessible. There are recommendations for preparing a disaster supply kit available [here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ready.gov%2Fkit&data=05%7C01%7CReardonAJ%40state.gov%7C3e8438dd089649b8e8c008db18c830c1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638131020306664132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RFITt5b12ob6xD9WNG2Bk4AbXZWpeH2CaU4E2TXu9Sc%3D&reserved=0).

Citizens are advised to consult with authorities and/or hotel management if in doubt of the need to leave an area. All U.S. citizens are encouraged to monitor the news closely, including the [SENAPRED website.](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsenapred.cl%2F&data=05%7C01%7CReardonAJ%40state.gov%7C3e8438dd089649b8e8c008db18c830c1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C638131020306664132%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DQVPoMl6wlaVhRcT7pyRp0OTPM1pLee8LqWwRXiHRVM%3D&reserved=0)

There are minefields on Chile's border with Peru and Bolivia, and Argentina in Patagonia. Follow clearly identified roads and trails when in minefield areas. Consult with national park or other local officials concerning minefields.

For outdoor and adventure sports along the border with Argentina, Bolivia or Peru, register with Chile’s [Dirección Nacional de Fronteras y Limites del Estado](https://difrol.gob.cl/en/), which can provide a permit allowing travelers to temporarily cross borders to engage in outdoor activities.

Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting persons lost or injured in isolated and wilderness areas is difficult. You should only undertake organized adventure activities with a well-established and insured company. If you intend to hike, never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company. Inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to return. Register with park officials, when available, or the nearest police station when pursuing outdoor activities in remote areas. Obtain detailed information on hiking trails before setting out and do not venture off marked trails. Distances between centers for outdoor sports and top-notch hospital care can be extreme. You should consider getting medical evacuation insurance.

Before you go, consult:

* [Chilean Meteorological Service](http://www.meteochile.gob.cl/PortalDMC-web/index.xhtml) (weather forecasts)

Under Chilean law, you can be expelled from the country for damaging national heritage objects or places. Travelers should learn and adhere to all the rules of visiting national parks.

**LGB Travelers:**There are no legal restrictions on adult same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Chile. Since 2022, under Law 21400, same-sex marriage is legal in Chile. There have been cases of discrimination due to sexual orientation including cases involving violence or death. Laws also prevent those who do not conform with their assigned sex at birth from changing sex markers on government-issued identity documents.
