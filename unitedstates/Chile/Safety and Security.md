# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Demonstrations occur frequently, especially on March 29, May 1 and 21, September 11, and October 18. Although most are peaceful, they can become violent. Avoid demonstrations if possible. Strikes are also common and can cause significant travel delays, especially if you are traveling to remote areas, such as Easter Island, Punta Arenas, or Chiloe.

Anarchist groups have placed explosive and incendiary devices in public spaces throughout Santiago, such as ATMs, metro stations, and government facilities. Remain vigilant and avoid suspicious or unattended packages.

**Araucanía Conflict:** Some individuals or groups claiming affiliation with the Mapuche indigenous community have sought redress for grievances by burning churches, homes, and pastures, and attacking trucks, buses, and farming/logging equipment, causing property destruction, injuries, and deaths. In 2022, the Government of Chile implemented a State of Emergency in the area that is reevaluated every 15 days. While these groups have mainly targeted forestry corporations and landowners, you should exercise caution in the Araucanía region.

**Crime:** Street crime, carjackings, telephone scams, credit card fraud, and residential break-ins are common, especially in Santiago, Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Calama, and Iquique. Exercise significant caution when touring Cerro Santa Lucia, Cerro San Cristobal, Mercado Central, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, Yungay, Barrio Lastarria, Persa BioBio, Barrio Meiggs, Patronato, Centro Cultural Estación Mapocho and Los Dominicos in Santiago, or other popular tourist sites as pickpocketing and muggings occur frequently. Small bags and purses have been stolen from hotel lobbies, crowded tourist locations, Santiago’s subway, taxis, and the backs of chairs and floors at bars, restaurants, and cafés. Cell phones are often stolen from restaurant tables. Criminals have drugged and robbed U.S. citizens, leaving them with no memory of events. The murder of a U.S. citizen occurred in 2023 in the neighborhood of Yungay. Carjackings and vehicle thefts are a serious problem in Santiago, Valparaiso, and northern Chile (from Iquique to Arica). Thieves have punctured rental car tires to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the vehicle.

Additionally, though not typical touring areas, exercise significant caution when traveling through or in Villa Francia, El Castillo, La Victoria, La Pincoya, Bajos de Mena y Mahuidanche, and the municipalities of Cerro Navia, Pudahuel, Quilicura and San Bernardo in Santiago,

In particular:

* Keep all valuables on you when taking buses, especially to or from Calama and San Pedro de Atacama. Thefts are common and are often done by people posing as bus employees.
* Never allow your credit card to be charged outside of your view.
* Do not accept assistance if your clothes are splashed with a wet, sticky substance - keep moving and do not let go of your bags.
* Do not accept any beverages from strangers.
* Do not leave luggage unattended, even in locked vehicles.
* Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Criminals rarely work alone, and things are not worth the possibility of physical harm or death.
* Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.
* Use caution when walking or driving at night, especially if alone.
* Do not use unauthorized taxi services.  Individuals should use regulated taxis with orange or yellow license plates or ride-share applications. See Travel and Transportation section for more information
* Always carry a copy of your U.S. identification (passport, driver’s license) and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Counterfeit and pirated goods are generally illegal in Chile. Bringing them to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. See the [intellectual property section of the U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.
