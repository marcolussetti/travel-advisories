Exercise increased caution in Chile due to **crime and** **civil unrest.**

**Country Summary:** Street crime (e.g., muggings, pick-pocketing, theft) is common in Chile. Rates of violent crime, such as assaults, homicide, carjackings, and residential break-ins, are increasing.

Large-scale demonstrations periodically occur in Santiago and other cities in Chile. Demonstrations can take place with little or no notice, and often result in disruptions to transportation, including public bus and Santiago metro services.Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Chile.html) for additional information on travel to Chile.
