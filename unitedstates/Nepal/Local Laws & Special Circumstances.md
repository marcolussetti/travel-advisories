# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on       [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to [notify](https://np.usembassy.gov/contact/) the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are arrested in Nepal, the authorities may keep you in detention for weeks or even longer during the investigation stage. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Driving Under the Influence:** Driving in Nepal after consuming any amount of alcohol could result in arrest.

**Illicit Drugs:** Purchasing, possessing, or consuming illegal drugs, including marijuana and hashish, could result in both fines and jail time.

**Firearms and Ammunition:** You may not bring any kind of firearm or ammunition into Nepal. Violators who bring in firearms or ammunition—even imitations or in jewelry form—may be prosecuted.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.

**Faith-Based Travelers:** Religious conversion and proselytization are illegal in Nepal. See the following webpages for details:

**International Volunteers:**

Nepal’s Department of Immigration considers volunteering as work and thus requires volunteers to obtain a work visa. **Volunteering on a tourist visa is illegal**, and can result in detention by immigration authorities, fines, expulsion from Nepal, and lengthy bans on returning to Nepal.

There has been occasional fraud associated with some charities in Nepal. If you are not certain about an organization, you may want to consider routing contributions through a reputable national or international charity to avoid the possibility that your time and money could unknowingly support the exploitation of children.

**LGB Travelers:** There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Nepal. Same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized, and LGB persons in Nepal actively and openly advocate for their rights. Nepal, however, remains a conservative and traditional society. Discrimination exists, and reports of non-violent harassment of LGB persons have been received. Accordingly, LGB travelers may wish to be discreet and avoid public displays of affection.

* See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/nepal) for additional details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Nepal prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited throughout Nepal. Nepali law requires access to buildings, transportation, and other services, but poor infrastructure often makes it difficult for people with mobility issues to get around, even within the Kathmandu Valley. Apart from a few clinics and hospitals, Nepal generally lacks accessible and suitable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

**SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

**TREKKING IN NEPAL**

**DO NOT TREK ALONE:**The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu **strongly discourages** U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. The safest option for trekkers is to join an organized group and/or use a reputable trekking company that provides an experienced guide and porters who communicate in both Nepali and English.

Requirements established by the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) and more than a dozen trekking organizations, with the support of Nepal’s Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, **require solo or foreign independent trekkers to use a local licensed guide while trekking in Nepal’s official national parks and protected areas.**Failure to comply with this requirement may result in considerable fines. Please review travel related information on the official websites of the [Nepal Tourism Board](https://ntb.gov.np/)and the [U.S. Embassy Kathmandu](https://np.usembassy.gov/alert-new-requirements-for-use-of-trekking-guides-porters-effective-april-1-2023/) prior to travel. Provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to trekking and check in at all police checkpoints where trekking permits are logged. [Register your itinerary](https://step.state.gov/) with the U.S. Embassy through the STEP enrollment process.

**Natural Disaster Risks:**Trekkers should be alert to the possibility of avalanches, landslides, and falling rocks, even when trails are clear. Earthquakes can destabilize mountainous areas, causing severe landslides. Flooding during monsoon season also increases the risk of landslides.

**Altitude Risks: Follow medical advice regarding high altitude mountain sickness.** Everyone, regardless of age, experience, or fitness level, should exercise caution when trekking at high altitudes. Many popular trekking routes in Nepal cross passes as high as 18,000 feet. Only experienced mountain climbers should tackle the Himalayas.Acclimatization is best achieved by walking slowly, rather than hurrying, at high altitudes. Without acclimatization, trekkers can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), which can be deadly. Speak with your doctor for specific recommendations. We strongly recommend supplemental travel and evacuation insurance.

**Evacuation by Helicopter:** Obtain emergency medical [evacuation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) insurance  before visiting Nepal. Many foreigners require or request evacuation by helicopter from Nepal’s rugged mountain terrain. Helicopter companies will generally require either specific evacuation insurance, pre-approval from your health insurance, or payment upfront by credit card to assist. Carry appropriate insurance and travel with credit card information. If you want your health insurance to cover large bills without pre-approval, be aware that the service provider might keep your passport until they receive payment. Beware of medevac scams, which can occur in Nepal.  Trekkers should use only evacuation agencies registered with the [Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN)](https://www.taan.org.np/) and find out the costs for evacuations beforehand.

**Lodging and Travel:** During peak trekking seasons make advance booking for hotel rooms and plan for possible flight/airport delays. Domestic air flight cancellations and delays occur frequently because of bad weather. Leave ample time to catch outbound international flights when connecting from domestic flights. Be aware that many hotels in Nepal do not meet international fire or earthquake safety standards.

**TIMS Card and Trekking Permits:** Foreign visitors on hiking trips in Nepal, including those not with organized hiking groups, are required to have a valid TIMS card through authorized trekking agencies registered with the Government of Nepal. In case of an emergency, this system helps authorities find trekkers.

**Special Permits for Restricted Areas:** Trekking in certain remote areas of Nepal and in national parks may require additional permits or fees. Travelers may consult with an experienced tour agency or review the website of the [Nepali Department of Immigration](https://immigration.gov.np/en)for more information. Please be aware that restricted areas have special requirements for helicopter rescue flights, which may delay assistance even in the event of a medical emergency.

**Natural Disasters:** Nepal is at high risk for major earthquakes. The country lacks adequate emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities, and building codes are not strictly enforced. Nepal is also prone to flooding and landslides. The Government of Nepal may have limited ability to respond to natural disasters.
