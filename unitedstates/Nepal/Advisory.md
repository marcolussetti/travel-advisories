**Country Summary**: Political demonstrations intended to be peaceful can sometimes escalate into violence and may be met with force by Nepali authorities. 

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Nepal.html)  for additional information on travel to Nepal.

If you decide to travel to Nepal:

* Avoid demonstrations and crowds.
* Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.
* Do not trek or climb alone. The Government of Nepal requires solo or foreign independent trekkers (FITs) to use a local guide or porter while trekking in Nepal’s official national parks and protected areas.
* Review the [Adventure Travel Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/adventure-travel.html) before your trip.
* Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
