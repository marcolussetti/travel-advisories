**General:** Medical care outside the Kathmandu valley may be limited and not up to U.S. standards. Medical facilities can lack resources. Similarly, mental health care outside of Kathmandu may be limited, and U.S. citizens with mental health problems are usually stabilized and transported to the United States or a regional center for care at their own expense. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu maintains a [list of local medical facilities and practitioners](https://np.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/).

For emergency services in Nepal, **dial 102**.

Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Kathmandu.

See our [Health Abroad page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad.html) for more information.

* Check the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Traveler Advice for [Nepal](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/nepal?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).
  + Review all sub-sections.  These include Travel Health Notices, Vaccines and Medicines, Non-Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Stay Healthy and Safe, Healthy Travel Packing List, and After Your Trip.
* We highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Travelers’ Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center).  CDC Traveler Advice provides advice on medical considerations including:
  + Reasons for Travel (for example: Adventure Travel, Spring Break Travel)
  + Travelers with Special Considerations (for example: Allergies, Long-Term Travelers and Expatriates)
  + General Tips (for example: Traveling with Medications, Travel Vaccines)

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills**. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage [for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html). Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation when visiting Nepal.

Serious medical issues and injuries suffered while hiking in remote areas may require evacuation by helicopter to Kathmandu. Those trekking in remote areas of Nepal should factor the high cost of a potential helicopter rescue into their financial considerations. Medical evacuations can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Payment will be expected in cash before the medevac can take place, if there is no insurance coverage. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. government pays private medical bills overseas.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Nepal Public Health Foundation](https://www.nphfoundation.org/) to ensure the medication is legal in Nepal.

**Vaccinations:** Stay up-to-date on all [vaccinations recommended](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:** Assisted Reproductive Technology services are widely available in Nepal and are generally safe. Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Nepal and is subject to complex local regulations. Individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. For additional information, visit the [U.S. Embassy in Nepal](https://np.usembassy.gov/surrogacy-services-are-banned-in-nepal/#:~:text=Surrogacy%20was%20halted%20by%20the,date%20as%20a%20cut%2Doff.) website.

**Stray Animals**: Stray animals are common on the streets of Kathmandu and at popular tourist sites. Stray animals may be infected with rabies. The CDC’s [Preventing Dog Bites](https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-pets/about/dogs.html) webpage recommends that if you are bitten by an animal, get to a safe place, immediately wash wounds with soap and water, and seek medical attention.

**Pharmaceuticals:** To avoid problems at port of entry, always carry prescribed medication in the original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the [Embassy of Nepal](https://us.nepalembassy.gov.np/) to ensure that the medication is legal in Nepal. Local authorities irregularly enforce restrictions on certain drugs regularly prescribed by doctors in the United States or other foreign countries.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back.  The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States.  Visit the websites of [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-drug-info-rounds-video/traveling-prescription-medications) for more information.

**Water Quality & Food Safety:** Outside of Kathmandu, intestinal tract diseases, including cholera, are present. Sanitary food handling practices may not be on par with practices in the United States, and precautions should be taken to prevent water and food-borne illnesses. Travelers should avoid raw, green, leafy vegetables during the monsoon season because of the risk of cyclospora.

In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Nepal. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. Consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.

Travelers with asthma, allergies, heart disease, or environmental sensitivities are more likely to be affected and may want to bring their required medications.

Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).
