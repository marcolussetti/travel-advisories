# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Political-Related Violence:** The potential for isolated political-related violence remains a risk in Nepal. Demonstrations have on occasion turned violent, although these activities generally have not been directed at U.S. citizens.

**Crime:** Crime is relatively low throughout the country. Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can happen at popular tourist spots. Store valuables, including passports and cash, in the hotel safety deposit box; do not carry them. The Nepal Tourist Police recommend that you carry a photocopy of your passport when going out.

**Scams:** Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Nepal.  Review the Department of State’s [Protecting Yourself from Scams](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/international-financial-scams.html) and the [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud) pages for information.

**Technology Usage Abroad:** Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, update all software (operating system and apps). If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.

GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. The GPS app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.

Be careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.

**Victims of Crime:** U.S. citizen victims of crime in Nepal are encouraged to [contact the U.S. Embassy](https://np.usembassy.gov/contact/)in Kathmandu for assistance.

Report crimes to the local police by dialing 100 as soon as the incident occurs. This number is equivalent to 911, and it is staffed 24/7 by the local police. When calling the emergency number, speak slowly and clearly so that your message gets across to the official without misunderstanding. [Tourist Police](https://ntb.gov.np/plan-your-trip/before-you-come/tourist-police), who can be reached by dialing 1144, +977-01-4247041, or +977-9851289444, speak English and are ready to assist in popular tourism areas. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.
