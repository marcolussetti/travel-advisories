**Regular Tourist Visas:**

* If you will arrive by air, either apply for a tourist visa at a [Nepali embassy or consulate](https://us.nepalembassy.gov.np/tourist-visa/) before traveling or purchase a tourist visa upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. Note that obtaining a visa on arrival may take several hours, and pre-arrival visas are subject to availability. Check with the nearest Nepali embassy or consulate for current availability.
* For an online visa application form, see the [Nepali Department of Immigration Online Visa Services](https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/). Note that obtaining a visa on arrival may take several hours.
* If you will arrive by land, you must obtain a visa. Nepali authorities do not stop all foreign citizens who enter by land to process immigration and visa documentation.  If you do not have a visa and do not receive an entry stamp from an immigration officer, you will not be allowed to depart Nepal and may face additional consequences.
* When entering Nepal by land, U.S. citizens must carry U.S. cash to pay their Nepali visa fees. Credit cards or other currencies will not be accepted. All U.S. bills must be new (no older than 2003) and in good condition (no tears, excessive wear, etc.) Immigration offices are open 24 hours at official land crossings.
* You can purchase an on-arrival tourist visa at the following land border points of entry:

1. Kakarvitta, Jhapa District (Eastern Nepal, arrival and departure)
2. Biratnagar, Morang District (Southeastern Nepal, arrival and departure)
3. Birgunj, Parsa District (Central Nepal, arrival and departure)

6. Timure, Rasuwa District (Northern Border, arrival and departure)

Tourists obtaining visas on-arrival may stay no more than **150** days in any given calendar year. Visas will only be given in 15-, 30-, or 90-day increments, but may be extended at the Department of Immigration offices.

The visa fees at the airport and checkpoints are:

Visa fees are payable in U.S. dollars. Money exchanges and ATM services are available at the airport. Credit cards may also be accepted at the airport.

**Other Visa Categories: As of February 2025, foreign travelers must arrive in Nepal on a tourist visa and can only convert their visa to a different category after arrival.**Check with the [Department of Immigration](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.nepalimmigration.gov.np%2Ftourist-visa&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7Cb0f221da6b564c146e2408da6a8365a1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637939409819056834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3hujQHWwB4CJvLK7%2BXA%2BhcAJ4OBKSOteTOzCFF7mkuQ%3D&reserved=0 "http://online.nepalimmigration.gov.np/tourist-visa") for visa details and the online applications, including student and work visas. Your purpose of travel will dictate what category of visa you will need. If you intend to apply for a study or work visa from Nepal, you should start the visa conversion process with the institution/employer and the concerned government authorities at least two months prior to expiration of your tourist visa. **Non-tourist visa issuance has been known to take months to process and stays beyond 150 days on a tourist visa will lead to deportation with overstay fines and penalties.**

**Extending Your Visa:**

* The Department of Immigration headquarters in Kathmandu is the only office that can extend all categories of visas.
* Immigration offices in Pokhara, Kakarvitta, Birgunj and Belahiya can extend tourist, relationship (marriage) and Non-Residential Nepali (NRN) visas.
* Visitors should apply to extend their visas before the expiration date; failure to do so will result in penalty and late fees.
* Long overstays beyond the expiration date can result in heavy fines, arrest, and detention pending formal deportation proceedings, followed by a ban on re-entry.
* Payment at the Department of Immigration can be made only in cash via Nepali rupees or U.S. dollars.

**Requirements for Exit:**

* You must have a valid visa in a valid passport before you will be allowed to depart Nepal. If your visa has expired, you must extend your visa before you will be allowed to depart.
* The Immigration Office at Tribhuvan International Airport is not authorized to extend visas. Travelers at the airport with expired visas will be sent to the Immigration Office in Kathmandu to pay the extension fee, which may take a couple of days to process.
* If you renew or replace your passport at the Embassy in Kathmandu, you must go to the Department of Immigration to transfer your Nepali visa into the new passport. Do not transfer a visa from one passport into another on your own as this a crime in Nepal, punishable by imprisonment and fines.
* See the Government of Nepal’s [Department of Immigration website](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.nepalimmigration.gov.np%2Ftourist-visa&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7Cb0f221da6b564c146e2408da6a8365a1%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637939409819056834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3hujQHWwB4CJvLK7%2BXA%2BhcAJ4OBKSOteTOzCFF7mkuQ%3D&reserved=0 "http://online.nepalimmigration.gov.np/tourist-visa") for most current visa information

**Travel across the Nepal-China Border:** You must obtain a special permit for tourist travel to Tibet. Chinese authorities may require U.S. citizens and other foreign tourists to organize "group" tours through established travel agencies as a prerequisite for obtaining visas and entry permits into Tibet. For current regulations on entry into Tibet, please read the [Department of State’s travel information for China](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html).

**Currency and Money Issues**: Travelers must declare the import or export of currency that exceeds $5,000 USD via a customs declaration form. Travelers should keep a copy of the declaration form after customs officials have put the official endorsement and appropriate stamps on the form to prevent any problems upon departure. Please note that this requirement is subject to change and travelers should contact the [Embassy of Nepal in Washington, D.C.](https://us.nepalembassy.gov.np/) for the latest information. Carrying Indian currency in denominations greater than 100 rupees notes is illegal/restricted in Nepal. Travelers coming to Nepal from India who hope to change Indian currency into Nepali Rupees are advised to bring 100 Indian Rupee notes or lower denominations only. Nepali Rupees cannot be exchanged outside of Nepal.

**Customs:**[Nepal customs regulations](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/nepal-trade-barriers?navcard=11914) are complex. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning importation (even temporarily) and exportation of certain items. Do not carry valuable metals, articles of archaeological or religious significance, wildlife or related items, drugs, or weapons and ammunition. Do extensive research before importing household pets (including cats and dogs), communications equipment, and other items that might be perceived as sensitive. Drones are strictly regulated throughout Nepal and require special permission from the Home Ministry and other government authorities.

**Dual Nationality**: Nepal does not recognize dual nationality. Accordingly, when a Nepali citizen naturalizes as a U.S. citizen, he/she loses his/her Nepali citizenship. Some travelers who have tried to maintain both U.S. and Nepali passports have faced difficulties entering or exiting Nepal. U.S. citizens of Nepali descent may be eligible for a special visa called a “Non-Resident Nepali” or “NRN” Identity Card. The NRN Identity Card allows a holder to open a local bank account, invest, and own certain types of property, subject to certain restrictions. For more information, contact the [Nepali Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mofa.gov.np/)or the [Embassy of Nepal](https://us.nepalembassy.gov.np/) in the United States.

**HIV Restrictions:** The Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Nepal.

**U.S. Military Personnel and DOD Contractors:** DOD personnel must review the [**Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG)**](https://apacs.milcloud.mil/fcg/loginForm.cfm) for travel to Nepal. Contact information for the Defense Attaché Office can be found in the FCG if you have additional questions.
