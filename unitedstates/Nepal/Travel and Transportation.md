# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety**: In Nepal, vehicles are driven on the left-hand side of the road. In general, roads in Nepal are in poor condition and lack basic safety features, resulting in significant numbers of accidents and fatalities. Traffic is poorly regulated, and traffic jams are common on major streets. Many drivers are neither properly licensed nor trained, vehicles are poorly maintained, and public vehicles are often overloaded.

Nepali law requires that you have a valid Nepali license to legally operate a motor vehicle in Nepal. If you drive without a valid local license, you will expose yourself to greater legal liability. The Nepal Department of Transportation does not convert U.S. driver’s license into a Nepali license. Foreign nationals must either pass the driving test in Nepal or obtain an online International Driving Permit.

**Traffic Laws**: U.S. citizens involved in an accident in Nepal should call 103, the traffic hotline. Police will investigate if necessary to determine the guilty party in an accident with injury or vehicle damage. In cases of severe injury or death you may want to hire a local attorney as charges may be filed. Drivers should either have an international license or Nepali license on them when driving. All vehicles must be insured. To make an insurance claim you will need a police report. If stopped by civil police, they may request to see travel documents, such as a passport.

**Monsoon Impact on Trekker Safety:** Many monsoon-related deaths and injuries are reported each year in Nepal. Monsoon Season generally begins in June and ends in September. Monsoons destabilize mountainsides and cause flooding. Landslides and mudslides caused by monsoons frequently damage trails and roads, injuring or killing passengers in vehicles, and causing road blockages that may take considerable time to repair, stranding travelers. Remote airports in mountainous areas are sometimes closed for multiple days (or even weeks) during inclement weather, which can force travelers to choose between lengthy delays or hazardous roads or trails. Monsoon rains may also complicate efforts to locate U.S. citizens and arrange medical evacuations.

**Nighttime Travel:** Avoid nighttime road travel outside major cities because of insufficient street lighting and hazardous road conditions. Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling at night outside urban areas in Nepal.

**Motorcycle Travel:** Deaths from motorcycle accidents have risen dramatically in recent years, including in Kathmandu. Always wear a helmet, particularly on highways.

**Buses:** Long-distance buses often drive recklessly, and bus accidents involving fatalities are not uncommon. It is dangerous to travel on the roofs of buses as live electrical and other communications wires hang low in many places. Traffic police also impose fines and detain individuals for riding on the roofs of buses.

**Taxis:** Taxis are a safer and more convenient alternative to buses. Almost all taxi drivers in Nepal insist on negotiating the price of the trip in advance, even if the taxi has a meter installed. Online apps for taxis, such as Pathao, are widely used.

**Pedestrian Travel:**Sidewalks are nonexistent in many areas, and drivers generally do not yield the right-of-way to pedestrians. Pedestrians account for a considerable portion of traffic fatalities in Nepal.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Nepal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s [website](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa) includes more information on its assessment program.

Domestic air safety is a concern. In recent years, there have been several fatal plane crashes on domestic routes in Nepal, including some crashes in which U.S. citizens have been killed. Nepal’s mountain airports, including Lukla and Jomsom, are notoriously dangerous due to challenging weather and terrain. As a result of Nepal’s poor aviation safety record, since 2013 the European Union (EU) has banned all Nepali airlines from flying into or within EU countries. Although Nepali domestic flights are insured, payments to the families of victims of a plane crash are minimal. Domestic air travelers may want to consider flight insurance that will cover domestic flights in Nepal before leaving home. Check [Nepal’s air safety profile](https://asn.flightsafety.org/database/countries/9N) with the Aviation Safety Network.
