For emergency services in Trinidad and Tobago, dial: 999 for police or 990 for Fire/EMS.

Ambulance services are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Public ambulance service is limited and often has slow response times due to low availability and high demand. There are private ambulance services, which require payment before transportation.

See [this page](https://www.findyello.com/trinidad/ambulance-service/) for a list of private air and regular ambulance services in Trinidad and Tobago.

Medical care is below U.S. standards. While care at some private facilities is better than at most public health facilities, patients may need to prove ability to pay before receiving assistance, even in emergencies. Patients requiring blood transfusions are expected to arrange for at least the same amount to be donated on their behalf. Physicians and nurses have been known to go on strike, straining public medical services.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [Insurance Overseas page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html?cq_ck=1708701048867) for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Travel Insurance page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

* We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of [Trinidad and Tobago](http://www.customs.gov.tt/) to ensure the medication is legal in Trinidad and Tobago.  Please note that many medicines prescribed in the United States are not easily accessible through the local pharmacies. A six-month supply of required medicines is recommended for travelers.

While not present in the country, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago issued a warning of the Oropouche virus due to its proximity to South and Central America where there have been recent outbreaks. This disease is spread to humans through the bite of an infected small fly called a midge or possibly certain mosquitos.

**Vaccinations:** Be up to date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/trinidad-and-tobago?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001#vaccines-and-medicines) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
