# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Crime:**Violent crime, including assault, kidnapping, sexual assault, home invasions, and murder, is increasingly more common throughout Trinidad & Tobago. Avoid traveling alone, particularly after dark or in secluded areas.

Due to high crime rates, U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling to the following areas: Laventille, Beetham, Sea Lots, Cocorite, and the interior of Queens’ Park Savannah.

Avoid the following places after dark:

* Beaches
* Downtown Port of Spain
* Fort George
* Queen’s Park Savannah

Tourists are particularly vulnerable to pick-pocketing and armed assaults in these locations. Criminal activity often increases before and during holiday periods.   
   
Gang activity, such as narcotics trafficking, is common. A significant portion of violent crime is gang related.

Criminals have used dating apps and social media to lure victims to locations where they are mugged and beaten. Some have alleged distress to rob victims who stop to help them. Others have contacted victims for fraudulent online sales schemes.

Exercise caution at isolated waterfalls and beaches in Tobago due to muggings. Violent home invasions have occurred in Tobago, in particular in the Mt. Irvine, Buccoo Bay, and Bacolet areas.

Criminals may use copied sets of house keys to gain entry to residences. If you rent a property, ensure that adequate, 24-hour security measures are in place.
