# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:**  You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.

It may be illegal to take pictures of government and military facilities. Get permission before taking such pictures.

Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Trinidad and Tobago are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.

It is illegal to carry ammunition when arriving, departing, or transiting through Trinidad and Tobago. Individuals found with as little as one bullet, a previously discharged bullet casing, or spent ammunition used in items such as jewelry or keyrings on their person or in their luggage at the airport have been detained, charged, and fined.

Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1617-extraterritorial-criminal-jurisdiction-18-usc-112-878-970-1116) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html) for further information.

**Camouflage Warning**: It is prohibited to import any camouflage-pattern material without approval from the Ministry of National Security. Wearing camouflage clothing in public is prohibited. Camouflage uniforms may be worn if you are in Trinidad and Tobago on official military business.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods**: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to surrender counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/fakegoodsrealdangers#:~:text=It%20is%20illegal%20to%20purchase%20counterfeit%20goods.%20Bringing,activities%2C%20such%20as%20forced%20labor%20or%20human%20trafficking.) and [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**LGB Travelers:** The government does not enforce the law criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults. In April 2018, a court ruled the law unconstitutional, but the government is still appealing the ruling.

See our [LGB Travel Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgbtqi.html) page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports-bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:**The law in Trinidad and Tobago prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. While accessibility is limited, accessible bathrooms, ramps, handrails, signage, designated parking spaces, and hearing loops can be found. Access is even more limited on public transportation. Rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, as well as service providers (sign language interpreters or personal assistants) are available. There is not a significant difference between Port of Spain and the rest of the country.
