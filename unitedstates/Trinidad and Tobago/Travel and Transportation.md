# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety:** It is illegal to use mobile phones while driving, except in hands-free mode. The penalty for talking or texting while driving is $240 USD or three months of imprisonment. Police administer breathalyzer tests at unannounced checkpoints and conduct traffic stops if they suspect someone is driving while intoxicated.

Roadside assistance exists but is limited and may involve lengthy delays. Drunk drivers are a particular concern on the weekends, especially after dark. Drive defensively and be careful on narrow and winding roads near beach areas and small towns.

**Traffic Laws:** Vehicles drive on the left side of the road. Most vehicles are right-hand drive, but left-hand drive vehicles are permitted. Rental cars are available and are generally right-hand drive. U.S. driver's licenses and International Driving Permits are valid for up to 90 days after arrival. Seatbelts are required for drivers and front seat passengers, and violators may be fined.

**Public Transportation:** Unmarked taxis and “maxi taxis” (minibuses) may stop abruptly in the middle of the road or veer across several lanes of traffic to pick up or drop off passengers. Only use private taxis in Port of Spain. For travel between cities, use private taxis or full-sized inter-city buses.

**Vehicle Accident Procedures:** Road fatalities increased significantly in 2024. If you are involved in an accident, contact local authorities immediately. If safe, render aid or assistance and remain on the scene until authorities arrive. Make sure to file an accident report with the local police station nearest the accident site within 24 hours.
