***Updated due to temporary nationwide State of Emergency***

Reconsider travel to Trinidad and Tobago due to serious risks from crime. There are also heightened risks of terrorism and kidnapping.

**State of Emergency**

On December 30, 2024, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago (GOTT) declared a nationwide State of Emergency (SOE). This is due to ongoing criminal activity that could threaten public safety. On January 13, 2025, Parliament extended the SOE until April 2025.

During the State of Emergency, the GOTT has imposed the following measures:

* The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has the authority to:
  + Arrest people on suspicion of involvement in illegal activities.
  + Search and enter public and private properties as needed.
* Bail is suspended for those suspected of committing a crime.
* Members of the Defense Force are following similar regulations as the local police.
* There are currently no curfews or restrictions on public gatherings.

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago will monitor the SOE daily. Restrictions may change with little or no notice.

Violence and shootings occur regularly in some areas of Port of Spain. Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Trinidad and Tobago are prohibited from travelling to the following areas in Port of Spain:
