**Country Summary:** Violent crime is common in Trinidad and Tobago. It includes:

Gang activity, such as narcotics trafficking, is common. A significant portion of violent crime is gang-related.

Foreigners and a U.S. lawful permanent resident have been recent victims of kidnapping.

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Trinidad and Tobago. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s [Country Reports on Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2023/trinidad-and-tobago/) to learn more.

If you decide to travel to Trinidad and Tobago:

* Use caution when walking or driving at night. Avoid poorly lit or remote areas.

* Develop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This helps them monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and whom you'll contact first to share the information.
