Medical facilities in Saint Lucia do not meet U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.

**We do not pay medical bills**

Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas.  
  
**Medical Insurance**

Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. . Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance coverage overseas.  
  
If traveling with prescription medication, check with the [government of St. Lucia](https://www.govt.lc/) to ensure the medication is legal in St. Lucia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.
