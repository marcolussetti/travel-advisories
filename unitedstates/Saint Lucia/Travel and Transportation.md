**Road Conditions and Safety:** Be extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads on foot. Major roads are in average to poor condition, and you may encounter wandering animals and slow moving heavy equipment. Drivers often stop in the middle of the roadway without warning. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and watch for signs of sudden braking. Automobiles may lack working safety and signaling devices.

See our [Road Safety page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/driving-and-road-safety.html) for more information.

**Traffic Laws:**Driving is on the left-hand side of the road. There is relatively little police enforcement of traffic regulations. A local temporary driver's license is required. These can be purchased at all car rental offices and from the Transportation Office in Gros Islet.  
  
**Public Transportation:** Public transportation consists of mini-buses and taxis.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for regulating aviation safety and security for the government of Saint Lucia, as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Saint Lucia’s air carrier operations.
