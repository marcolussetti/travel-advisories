Exercise normal precautions in the Kyrgyz Republic.  Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Exercise increased caution in:**

* The border region with Tajikistan.

Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Kyrgyzstan.html) for additional information on travel to the Kyrgyz Republic.

If you decide to travel to the Kyrgyz Republic:

* Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.
* ·Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive messages and Alerts  from the U.S. Embassy to make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
* Review the [Crime and Safety Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Kyrgyzstan/Detail) for the Kyrgyz Republic.

**Border Region with Tajikistan – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**

Exercise increased caution to areas within approximately 30 kilometers of the border with Tajikistan.  The March 13, 2025, signing and subsequent ratifying of a bilateral agreement between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have facilitated the resumption of cross-border movement, but the situation remains fluid.  As of March 2025, two checkpoints on the border are open for transit.  There are no travel restrictions for Americans crossing the border.  However, visitors to the Batken region (especially the Batken and Leilek districts) should exercise caution and remain vigilant due to a recent history of border clashes.

U.S. government employees working in the Kyrgyz Republic are restricted from traveling to the Batken province without prior authorization from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek.
