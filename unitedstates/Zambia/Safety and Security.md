# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

Zambia has few major security concerns. Visitors can avoid criminal activity by utilizing common sense measures provided below.

Political activity, especially during national and local elections, can lead to civil unrest and low-level violence. Spontaneous demonstrations occasionally occur and are often exacerbated by police action. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can quickly turn confrontational and escalate into violence. To stay safe, you should:

* avoid large crowds, demonstrations, and political gatherings
* follow media coverage of local events
* be aware of your surroundings at all times
* exercise caution when traveling throughout the country
* avoid walking alone in the downtown areas, high-density residential compounds, public parks, and poorly lit areas—especially at night.

**Crime:** The most commonly reported crimes committed against Westerners in Lusaka are non-violent confrontations characterized as crimes of opportunity (theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, confidence scams). Pickpockets operate in crowded markets and on public transportation, and visitors have reported snatch attacks of bags and smartphones on busy city streets as well as smash-and-grabs of valuables from vehicles idling in slow traffic and from parked cars. Other crimes, including thefts, violent attacks, including home invasions/robberies, and sexual assaults have occurred on many occasions. Victims are, on occasion, followed from banks, nightclubs, and ATMs and robbed at gunpoint, on the street, or upon arrival at their residence. Walking alone is not advisable in the downtown areas, high-density residential neighborhoods referred to locally as a “compound”, public parks, and other poorly illuminated areas, especially at night.

**Be aware of:**

* Pick-pockets operating in crowded markets and on public transportation;
* Snatch attacks of bags and smart phones on busy city streets;
* “Smash and grab” of valuables from vehicles idled in traffic and from parked cars;
* Thefts, violent attacks, home invasions/robberies; and
* Recent incidents involving sexual assaults.

**Demonstrations** occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.

* Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.
* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.

**International Financial Scams:**See the [Department of State Department of State](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html)and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes) pages for information.

Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Zambia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:

* Romance/Online dating
* Money transfers
* Contracts with promises of large commissions
* Work permits/job offers

**Border Areas:** Travelers should not drive off-road or in remote areas near the borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola because of the danger of undetected land mines and unexploded ordnance. If you must travel to these areas, you should drive in convoys and carry satellite telephones. Parts of the DRC border area can be plagued with unrest and/or armed criminal elements. See the Country Information pages for the [DRC](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html) and [Angola](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/angola.html) for additional information.

**Domestic Violence:** U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.

The legal age of marriage in Zambia is 16 for boys and girls with parental consent and 21 without consent. The law also prohibits Female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C) for women and girls and criminalizes rape and other sexual offenses, and courts have discretion to sentence convicted rapists to life imprisonment with hard labor. The law however does not include provisions for spousal rape. The penal code criminalizes domestic violence between spouses and among family members living in the same home. It also provides for prosecution of most crimes of gender-based violence, and penalties for conviction range from a fine to 25 years imprisonment, depending on the severity of injury and whether a weapon was used.

**Tourism**: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities and there are no trauma facilities in the country. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are advised to purchase [medical evacuation insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html).
