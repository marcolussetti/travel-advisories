[#### Health](javascript:void(0); "Health")

Private medical clinics in major cities provide reasonable care, but major medical emergencies usually require medical evacuation to South Africa, Europe, or the United States. The nearest air ambulances are based in South Africa. Government hospitals and clinics are often understaffed and lack supplies. Basic medical care outside of major cities is extremely limited. Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash payment for health services.

For emergency services in Zambia, dial 999 for General Emergency, 991 for Police and 993 for Fire.

 Ambulance services are:

* not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.
* not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**We do not pay medical bills.** Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.

**Medical Insurance:** Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our [webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) to cover medical evacuation.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check the [Dangerous Drugs Act](https://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Dangerous%20Drugs%20Act.pdf), or consult the [Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority](https://www.zamra.co.zm/) to ensure the medication is legal in Zambia.

Use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.

**HIV/AIDS**: Zambia has a very high burden of HIV. Travelers are generally at low risk for getting HIV but certain practices such as having unprotected sex or sharing needles with people who are or might be infected with HIV can significantly increase the risk of HIV transmission.  For more information on what you can do before and during travel to prevent HIV infection please visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [website.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/hiv)

There are shortages of medicine and medical supplies throughout Zambia.

Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about [Resources for Travelers](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/traveler-information-center) regarding specific issues in Zambia.

**Vaccinations:** Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Air Quality:** Air pollution can be a significant problem in many destinations overseas. Check [NASA’s Air Quality Forecast](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/aqforecast), which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), historical data, and global pollution modeling to generate a three-day forecast of expected air quality in [destination]. For information about common air pollutants, check the [CDC’s Air Quality page](https://www.cdc.gov/air-quality/pollutants/). For information about the U.S. Air Quality Index and health guidance, check out the EPA’s [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/).

The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals [here](https://zm.usembassy.gov/services/) under "local resources." We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.

**Health facilities in general**

* Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.
* Private hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.
* Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.

**Pharmaceuticals**

* Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas.  Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients.  Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items) and the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/buyingmedicinefromoutsidetheunitedstates/default.htm) websites for more information.
