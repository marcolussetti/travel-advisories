# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:** If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/arrest.html) for further information.

**Counterfeit and Pirated Goods:** Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the [U.S. Department of Justice website](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips) for more information.

**Drugs**: Possession of small quantities of an illegal substance can constitute drug trafficking in Zambia. A list of controlled substances in Zambia is included in the Local Resources section of the [U.S. Embassy Lusaka's webpage](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzm.usembassy.gov%2Fservices%2F&data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7Caedfafa0d1364dcc587708da3db2ecfc%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637890135929488738%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=UGOHdKMPXKbkfvFhpMfzlCrqKg74Tw0r4Bt1Px80Yr4%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://zm.usembassy.gov/services/.

**Wild Animal Products:** It is illegal to purchase tortoise shells, rhino horns, elephant ivory, or any items made out of these materials. Other wildlife products, such as hippo teeth, crocodile teeth or skins, flat skins, horns, or animal bones, should only be purchased from animal product vendors licensed with Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, which provide certification of purchase. Failure to produce a valid and legitimate certificate for these prescribed trophies can result in a five-year minimum prison sentence. Travelers must present the items and certification of purchase in person to Department of National Parks and Wildlife officials within 45 days of departure to obtain an export permit. Permits for items derived from CITES regulated species, such as hippo or crocodile, may take a number of days to obtain, may include additional fees, and may require an import permit from a destination country. Wildlife products with no export permit will be confiscated upon departure and the Government of Zambia will prosecute offenders to the fullest extent of the law with penalties ranging from large fines to minimum five-year prison sentences. It is illegal to export game meat in any form: dried, processed, or raw.

**LGB Travelers:** Zambian law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity and penalties for conviction of engaging in “acts against the order of nature” are 15 years to life imprisonment. The lesser charge of “gross indecency” carries penalties of up to 14 years imprisonment.

LGB persons in particular are at risk of societal violence due to prevailing prejudices, misperceptions of the law, lack of legal protections, and inability to access health services.

See our [LGB](http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/lgb.html) Travel Information page and section 6 of our [Human Rights report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/) for further details.

**Travelers with Disabilities:** The law in Zambia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the law is not effectively enforced. The Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities was created to promote awareness relating to the prevention of disabilities and the care of persons with disabilities; to cooperate with other government ministries in providing preventive, educational, training, employment, and rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Cultural attitudes toward disability vary, but in general social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Despite some improvements in largely urban areas, physical accessibility to services remains a pervasive problem across most of Zambia. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. *Contact the US Embassy in Zambia to receive a list of providers.*
