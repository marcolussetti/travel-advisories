[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Vehicle travel is extremely hazardous under normal conditions but particularly at night and in inclement weather.

When traveling in Zambia, please be aware:

* Secondary roads are not well maintained; use major roads whenever possible.
* Most roads do not have shoulders or sidewalks and are poorly lit.
* Pedestrians and livestock use the roadways.
* Passing another vehicle is dangerous given the general condition of roads.
* Lookout for tree branches or other debris which local drivers often place behind their cars to indicate a breakdown or trouble.
* Cars with non-functioning headlights and taillights are a common hazard.
* Night driving is discouraged.
* There are no emergency services for stranded or injured drivers.
* Auto accident victims are vulnerable to theft by those pretending to be helpful.

**Traffic Laws:**

* Vehicles drive on the left side of the road.
* Vehicles in traffic circles travel clockwise.
* It is illegal to turn left on a red light.
* Splashing a pedestrian as you drive through water is a traffic violation.
* You should come to a stop and pull to the side of the road if you hear sirens indicating an emergency vehicle or official motorcade.
* Use of seat belts is mandatory, as are helmets for motorcyclists.
* A child's seat is not mandatory by law but is recommended.
* It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving and the minimum fine if caught is equivalent to $60.
* The speed limit in Lusaka is 30 mph/50 km and 60 mph/100 km outside of city limits, unless otherwise indicated.
* If you are stopped by police and asked to pay a fine, you should obtain an official receipt or be directed to the nearest police station where you can make payment.
* Drivers under the influence of alcohol who are involved in accidents are tested at Lusaka's University Teaching Hospital (UTH) and then taken to court.

**Public Transportation:** City traffic is comprised mostly of cars and privately operated minibuses; motorcycles are rare. Some relatively nice buses travel between Lusaka and Livingstone and the Copperbelt. Minibuses serve as the primary means of intra-city travel in Zambia but are often overcrowded, poorly maintained, and seldom punctual.

See our [Road Safety page](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html) for more information.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:** As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Zambia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of the Republic of Zambia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the[FAA’s safety assessment page.](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa)
