For emergency services in Tonga dial 911.

Ambulance services are:

* not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.
* not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment.
* Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.

**The Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.**  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.

**Medical Insurance:**  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See [our webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/insurance-providers-overseas.html) for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tonga) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.

We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.

**Vaccinations:**Be up-to-date on all [vaccinations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tonga) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Special Circumstances:**

**Health facilities:**

* Vaiola Hospital, a private “referral” hospital is in Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa, with a 24/7 emergency department, and with medical and surgical capabilities to respond to emergencies of differing levels, and is able to stabilize patients if needed to medevac overseas. All essential drugs are available according to the essential drug list, and if specific drugs are not available, there may be other alternative of the same brand available from six nearby private pharmacies.
* The islands of Vava’u, Ha’apai and ‘Eua have hospitals. The hospital in Eua offers very limited medical services compared to that of Vava’u and Ha’apai.
