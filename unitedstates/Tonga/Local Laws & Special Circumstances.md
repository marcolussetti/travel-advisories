# Local Laws & Special Circumstances

[#### Local Laws & Special Circumstances](javascript:void(0); "Local Laws & Special Circumstances")

**Criminal Penalties:** You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.

Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on [crimes against minors abroad](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest/criminalpenalties.html) and the [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) website.

**Arrest Notification:**If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our [webpage](https://fj.usembassy.gov/arrest-of-a-u-s-citizen/) for further information.

**Customs:** Tonga’s customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Tonga of items such as firearms, explosives, motor vehicles, eggs, and certain types of alcohol. It is advisable to contact the Tongan Embassy in New York or the Consulate General of Tonga in Burlingame, CA for specific information regarding customs requirements.

**Cyclone Season:**The official cyclone season is November through April. The [Fiji Meteorological Service](https://www.met.gov.fj/) maintains a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Nadi serving the Southwest Pacific Region. The Tonga Meteorological Society is another good source for information in Tonga and they have a [warning service](https://met.gov.to/index_files/WarningServices.htm) to track weather events.  General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the [Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-can-you-do-crisis-abroad/natural-disasters.html) as well as from the [U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/) website.

**Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance***.*There are no legally mandated provisions for services for persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. There also are no programs to ensure access to communications and information for persons with disabilities. The Tonga Red Cross Society operates a school for children with disabilities and conducts occasional home visits. There is no specific government agency responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.
