[#### Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements](javascript:void(0); "Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements")

**Requirements for Entry:**

* Passport
* Visa
* World Health Organization (WHO) card with yellow fever vaccination when arriving from a yellow fever infected area

**Visas:**

Obtain your visa before traveling. Visit the [Embassy of the Republic of the Sudan](https://www.sudanembassy.org/) website for the most current visa information. Overseas inquiries should be made at the nearest Sudanese Embassy or consulate.

The Government of the Republic of the Sudan requires U.S. citizens to present a passport with at least six months validity and an entry visa or entry permit upon arrival at any port of entry in Sudan.

U.S. citizens must obtain an entry visa from a Sudanese embassy before arriving in Sudan. There is one exception to this requirement: U.S. citizens possessing a Sudanese national identification document (such as a Sudanese passport, alien registration card, or national identification card).

**Previous Travel to Israel:** Travelers with Israeli visas or exit/entry stamps are now permitted entry following a change in relations between Sudan and Israel in 2020.

**HIV/AIDS Restrictions:** Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Sudan. Sudanese law requires a negative HIV test result to obtain a work or residence visa. Please verify this information with the [Embassy of the Republic of the Sudan](https://www.sudanembassy.org/) before you travel.
