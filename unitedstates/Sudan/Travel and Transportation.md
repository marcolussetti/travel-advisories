# Travel and Transportation

[#### Travel and Transportation](javascript:void(0); "Travel and Transportation")

**Road Conditions and Safety:** Road conditions are poor and traffic accidents common. Driving is hazardous due to excessive speeds, erratic driver behavior, pedestrians, animals in the roadways, and vehicles that are overloaded or lack basic safety equipment. Only major highways and some streets in the cities are paved; others are narrow and rutted. While there are functioning traffic signals and streetlights on major thoroughfares in Khartoum, there are virtually none in other parts of the country.

A four-wheel-drive vehicle is strongly recommended due to variance in road conditions on major inter-city highways. South of Khartoum, road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season from June to October and dust storms (“haboobs”) greatly reduce visibility. Travel outside of Khartoum should be undertaken with a minimum of two vehicles to protect against the threat of criminal attacks. Use reliable GPS and carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Professional roadside assistance service is not available, and gas shortages are common.

**Landmines:** Exercise caution in remote areas or off main roads outside of Khartoum due to landmines. Landmines are most common in the Eastern states and Southern Kordofan. Stay on main roads marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.

**Traffic Laws:** An international driving permit or Sudanese license and third-party liability insurance from the government is required. You may use a U.S. driver's license for up to 90 days. You can get a local driving license from the police traffic department. It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving. Comprehensive insurance is recommended because many local drivers carry no insurance.

**Accidents:** In the event of an automobile accident, remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene, and proceed directly to the nearest police station. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.

**Public Transportation:** Avoid travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Your company’s in-country staff, travel agencies, and local hotels may be able to arrange private transport on your behalf. Any form of public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Service is basic and crowded. Schedules are unpublished and change without notice. While there is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses, many areas lack any public transportation.

**Buses:** Fatal accidents are routine. Many drivers have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Most buses and bus stops are privately operated and unmarked.

**Taxis:** Taxis are available throughout Khartoum; however, most do not meet U.S. safety standards. Drivers rarely speak English. Have your destination written down in Arabic.

**Trains:** There is weekly passenger train service from Khartoum to Wadi Halfa and to Port Sudan. Trains are dilapidated.

**Aviation Safety Oversight:**As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the [FAA’s safety assessment page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/).

**Maritime Travel:** Mariners planning travel to Sudan should also check for [U.S. maritime advisories and alerts](https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci-alerts). Information may also be posted to the  [U.S. Coast Guard homeport website](https://homeport.uscg.mil/), and the [NGA broadcast warnings](https://msi.nga.mil/NavWarnings).
