# Safety and Security

[#### Safety and Security](javascript:void(0); "Safety and Security")

**Terrorism:** Members and individual sympathizers of known terrorist groups and hardline political extremists could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Globally, terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:

* High-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
* Hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists
* Places of worship
* Schools
* Parks
* Shopping malls and markets
* Public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)

Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas near the border with South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state.

Landmines and other explosive remnants of war still exist in rural areas; Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, Darfur, and the Eastern states, including along the Eritrean border, are the most affected. Border closures may occur without notice.

Intercommunal and intracommunal clashes can occur throughout the country and can result in the declaration of localized states of emergency; civilians have been killed and government and security installations have been attacked.

**Blue Nile Region (Blue Nile, Sennar, and White Nile states) and Southern Kordofan Region (includes Abyei region, North Kordofan; South Kordofan; West Kordofan):** While violence has decreased significantly from previous years, tensions remain high. Banditry and intercommunal violence are common in these regions. Armed actors may transit the shared borders with South Sudan and Ethiopia.

**Darfur Region:** Flares of deadly intercommunal conflict continue, as does violence perpetrated by bandits and militias. Criminality, looting, and conflict over economic resources (land, gold, livestock) also is common. Tensions within camps for internally displaced people have resulted in fatalities and violence. Extrajudicial mobs and armed communal militia may mobilize quickly. Armed actors may transit Sudan’s shared borders with Chad and Central African Republic.

**Eastern Sudan (Kassala, Gedaref, and Red Sea States):** Escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan have prompted a sizeable build-up of military forces along the disputed border in Gedaref’s Fashaga region as well as recurring military-to-military engagements, clashes involving Ethiopian militias, and intercommunal reprisals over farmland. Incidents of cross-border criminality to include kidnapping have occurred. Human traffickers and organized crime syndicates are known to operate in the Kassala area (Kassala, Al Qadarif, and Red Sea states) along the Ethiopian and Eritrean borders. Stay on major roads if you are traveling by vehicle due to potential landmines and other explosive remnants of war.

**Crime:** Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking, can occur, though such crimes are more frequent outside of Khartoum. InKhartoum, home invasion, pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles, and other petty crime occur, and the number of petty crimes has increased over the past year. There is a risk of kidnapping. Expatriates are not generally targeted for crime in Khartoum, but may be caught in a ‘wrong place, wrong time’ situation.

Elsewhere in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, and looting is common; victims may be targeted based on perceived wealth or affiliation, and aid workers continue to be affected by such crimes. Banditry is prevalent throughout western Sudan, particularly in the Darfur and Chad–Sudan border regions, where several incidents have resulted in deaths. Sexual assault is widespread in areas of armed conflict.

* Avoid walking or traveling alone, especially after dark and particularly outside of Khartoum.
* Do not display cash and valuable personal property.
* Dress conservatively in clothing which covers the shoulders, upper arms, and legs to below the knee.
* Drive with doors and windows locked.
* Travel with a copy of your U.S. passport and Sudanese visa to prevent the originals from being taken. Keep original documents in a secure location. Use reputable travel firms, knowledgeable guides, and drivers.

**Demonstrations:** Small gatherings and demonstrations can occur with no warning and may escalate to violence. Protests are a regular occurrence since the 2019 revolution, with the pace increasing following the October 25, 2021 military takeover. Police and other security forces may intervene to disperse demonstrators, including with the use of tear gas and, in some instances, live ammunition, when protests occur near key governmental locations and/or impair freedom of movement. Protests and demonstrations have led to extended disruptions to telecommunications and, in some instances, airport closures, inhibiting U.S. citizens’ abilities to communicate with friends and family or depart the country. Historical anniversaries, calls for justice, and economic grievances, including bread, cooking oil, and fuel shortages, can precipitate demonstrations.

* Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.
* Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.
* Follow the advice of local authorities.
* Maintain several days’ supply of food and water and stay indoors until the demonstration has passed.
* Keep a low profile and observe all curfews.
* Have alternate means of communication in the event of disruptions to telecommunication services.
