# Travel and Transportation

**Road Conditions and Safety**: In N’Djamena, main roads are paved; others within the city are dirt and gravel roads that have large ruts and potholes. During the rainy season, mid-June to mid-September, many roads become impassable. Numerous traffic accidents occur daily. Excessive speed, erratic driving habits, and chronic lack of road signs make driving dangerous. Street lighting is limited, and it is difficult to see pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchairs, and animals at night.

Other risks include:

* Poor vehicle maintenance
* Headlights that are not used
* Vehicles with only one operable head light that give the appearance of being a motorcycle at night, often with deadly consequences for on-coming traffic

To mitigate the threat of roadside crime or becoming stuck in sand/mud when driving outside of N’Djamena, travel in daylight hours only.

Carry:

* Spare tires
* Food and water
* Maps and navigation equipment
* Extra fuel as it may be scarce in rural areas.
* Professional roadside assistance service is not available.

**Traffic Laws**: An international driving permit is required. Use of cell phones while driving and/or driving a vehicle with tinted windows is illegal.

**Roadblocks**: Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks in and around N’Djamena, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. They may also solicit bribes and require drivers to submit to pat-down body searches.

* Dim headlights as you slowly approach the check point.
* Do not permit soldiers or police officers to enter your vehicle, and do not get into the vehicle of anyone purporting to be a security official.
* Comply with the local authorities, and remain courteous and calm. If threatened, do not resist.
* Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate.
* Show documents through the window. Carry color photocopies of your passport and other identity documents to give to police.
* Keep original documents in a secure location.
* Report harassment to the U.S. Embassy.

**Accidents**: Remain inside the vehicle, and call for police. Although it is illegal to move your vehicle before police arrive, if a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.

**Public Transportation**: Public transportation is not recommended for tourists. Privately operated minibuses are often not properly maintained and dangerous. Although taxis are available throughout N’Djamena, they are unsafe and should not be used. Hire private transport from reliable sources; travel agencies and local hotels may also be able to arrange private transport for you.

* Do not accept rides that are not prearranged.
* Confirm identity of the assigned driver.
* Decline, politely but firmly, unofficial airport assistance with your luggage.

**Aviation Safety Oversight**: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Chad, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards.
